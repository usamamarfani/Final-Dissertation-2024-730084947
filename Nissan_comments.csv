They will drive costs up so high for people such as myself, who build and work around cars. That said, car guys are pissed optimists.  We'll hack them either way and do whatever we want.

I do not want to be far away from the brake pedal when it turns out that the car suddenly is unable to turn right for whatever reason. 4- What's the point of aiming for a high end machine (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Nissan GTR etc.) if its going to drive itself?. My point is, let people who want to use them use them, but don't impose it as standard.",0,,True,none,['Nissan']

Now we all see the incompetence. I'm trying to not be like an old person but I'm concerned about AI governing. But, you know that will at least be a real conversation in the future. 

I wonder what humanity will be like in the future. Perhaps by then we'll all have an advanced Siri that is everyone's AI companion/secritary/therapist/personal trainer.... I guess we have that already in some ways.

Side note: Buying a car will change to subscribing to Nissan for the rest of your life. Their commercials will change to ""Our AI is the safest & makes the fastest routes."" 

Also, cities aren't loud, vehicles are. Imagine autocars driving people between the outer ring of cities with the city centers having subways and bikes to get around. More green spaces and higher air quality.",0,,True,none,['Nissan']
