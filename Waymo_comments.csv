I highly respect your work, I have learned an enormous amount from your videos. That being said, I'd like to raise a couple of points which I find you have ignored in this video.


12:22 and 13:00
The question you have raised is only part of the whole story. A major issue with driverless cars is responsibility. No matter how bad a driver you are, if you cause an accident, you take the responsibility for it: you personally get fined, charged, locked up in jail, whatever. However, when (and it's a question of ""when"", not ""if""!) a driverless car causes a serious accident, who will assume responsibility? The manufacturer? What would that even mean? They get fined? So what? That'd be essentially assigning a price tag to human life. This is very serious ethical question that must be addressed by the society.

Let us not pretend to not see the enormous economic interest of car manufacturers here. They are all pushing for driverless cars because for them it would mean that they can replace ALL existing cars with a new one. We are talking about trillions of dollars here, the business of the century. This is markedly different from aviation, for example: I highly doubt that any airplane was thrown out off the window just because it was not equipped with an automated pilot. I think this concerns many people, and comments like yours that the real ethical question is why not to have a driverless car are pretty out-of-the-line for this reason. Don't get me wrong, driverless cars can be a wonderful additional technology for humanity. But I think FORCING it on society is unacceptable. 

Also, among all people you should be very well aware of the dangers in making humans independent on premature technologies. Aviation is a fairly simple problem compared to a complicated traffic situation in the middle of a city. We are very reasonable to question whether the technology is safe and developed enough. There is a reason why intertia in technology exists in critical applications. Why do you think the entire financial system runs on software written in COBOL? Why many nuclear power plants have DOS-based software (!), or why the international space station does not use the latest version of MS Windows (or any version of Windows for that matter. They use Debian Linux, for a good reason...)?

13:20
Come on... How do we check these claims? Why on Earth should we believe Google saying this? This is exactly what EVERY company says when they want to sell a product. How many examples shall I enlist here where entire societies have been tricked by corporations just to win a few billions of dollars? As for Waymo's studies: again, due to the extremely high economic interest, why should we believe ANY of them? Let us ask the authorities instead!",1,,True,none,['Waymo']

People weren't resistant to losing elevator operators because of ignorance of how they worked; that's dumb. They didn't want fights over who went where in what order.

As for the cars themselves, besides the obvious holes in their adaptability and potential to be hacked, the world's already polluted enough as it is without all those lasers firing at everyone all the time, creating MORE disabled people which will necessitate carbots even more in a viscious cycle until cancer is normalized. But hey, TOTALLY worth it if I can finally put on mascara while riding by myself without getting anyone immediately killed and not even bother to be a good driver at all anymore, defeating the whole point of manual override! Dismissing long term disaster because short term help and cool futuristic thing! WOO! Humanity, people! How about we instead work towards slowing down society so people wouldn't have to do those dumb things to get work done or satisfy appearance codes in a timely way, hm? And what about being ""conveniently"" driven to the wrong place or in circles at the company's whim? That's not freedom; that's just a different slavery, ESPECIALLY for the disabled.

Your entire video is biased towards specific sensor and technology choices made by Google that are ultimately inadequate for solving the real problem

They may be good for replacing taxis in a limited pre-mapped area, but they will never be able to replace driver-owned cars, which need to be able to travel anywhere (without HD mapping). Truly unrestricted self-driving is far harder than Waymo realizes, and their tiny fleet of glorified trolleys are keeping them blind to the mountain of technical challenges that lie ahead (in exchange for money now üí∞)

If they truly care about improving road safety, then they need to be able to replace the millions of privately owned vehicles that are already on the road. But with Waymo‚Äôs business model that will never happen, because the vehicles and their sensors are too expensive for anything other than a high-usage taxi service.

For instance, many laypeople seem to have the misguided idea that the goal should be literally zero self-driving accidents, yet we could be preventing millions of accidents with today‚Äôs technology.

States differ in the way they require drivers to insure their vehicles. Here in Florida, we ""no fault"" insurance-- I call it ""your fault"" insurance, because that's kind of what it is-- Everything is your fault. Each person assumes their share of the liability. The big cost in our insurance because of that is the PIP, or ""Personal Injury Protection"", because basically you have to be insured proportionate to the worst driver on the road, which makes insurance expensive here, but I digress...

We live in such a litigious society, and I know this sounds awful but let's face it, it's going to happen... but what happens when an autonomous vehicle runs over somebody's kid? Who is liable for that? You as the owner of the car? You as the passenger of the car? The manufacturer of the car? The author of the software? The victim (just your bad luck)? I don't ask this just to make a point. I ask because it seems like this question has to be answered before these things can be on the road, and surely it has been. I can't imagine the backers of Waymo putting their money behind this thing (or anyone insuring it) without knowing exactly where their liabilities begin and not, not just waiting to test it in court when the inevitable (and highly unfortunate) finally happens.

Don't get me wrong-- I'm a HUGE fan of this technology. I'm a software engineer, and I'm fascinated by it on a technical level. But I'm also legally blind and cannot drive. In our modern society, that's akin to a prison sentence. I'm largely a prisoner in my home, without relying on others to ferry me around. Yes, there is Uber (and of course my wife) but neither is anything remotely resembling the sense of independence that most people experience.

I cringe a lot when watching Tesla FSD beta videos, re its wild inconsistency re such safety issues thus far. 

Sometimes it's more timid than proverbial little old lady drivers around pedestrians.  Other times it will blast by big trucks parked on the side of the road with flashers on in a busy residential area, acting completely oblivious that the driver or a random pedestrian might step out from behind the truck. 

It's clearly FAR easier to do what Waymo is doing, one city at a time -- but UNTIL Tesla can PROVE it has a highly reliable generalized solution, the city by city approach outfits like Waymo and Mobileye are taking is clearly superior, re real world geofenced L4 robotaxis being a practical economic model.

Even better, we humans should not even be allowed to drive cars, we are dangerous.

As for Waymo, no, it is not fully autonomous it can't even be considered level 4, it can't think for itself, and it certainly can't predict what others may do. 
Also, it only works on geofenced pre-maped locations that act as ""invisible rails"" because the car can't understand what is happening around it, it will need machine learning A.I. to do that, while Waymo uses mostly human-writen code.
I could put a few cameras on a car and hard-code it to work around my neighborhood without a driver, this would not make it a fully autonomous car (meaning level 5). This is exactly what Waymo does but on a larger scale because of budget.

Waymo is 6-8 years behind Tesla and will probably never have anything better than lvl 3 that will work out of the specified locations as long as they keep using Lidar and not a vision-only/focused approach with machine learning and a huge amount of data (which they lack) to train it. 

Tesla will have level 5 by the end of 2023 and it will work everywhere, while Waymo will continue to only work on few pre-maped locations. The most important reason for this colossal lead is their approach (vision-based vs lidar), and the second reason is the amount and quality of the data. 
Waymo's number and quality are a joke, Tesla has more than 3.5 BILLION miles (at least 100 times of what Waymo has) on its A.I. and they also have more ""real-world"" conditions because they are not in few specified locations that are easy to drive around.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

I am not a fan of driverless cars:

1. Benefit for a very small array of very big companies.
Developing driverless cars is a technical and most of all a remakable IT challenge.
Only a small group of very big companies are going for it, we see that the challenge is so great that even some already big companies team up for this development.
The manpower and burnt funds for the development are massive.
The very few companies coming through with a safe driverless solution expect of course accordingly extraordinary profilts and return on their investment.

2. Who will be able to use a driverless car in the forseeable future? 
Driverless cars will, given a successful development, operate in areas with high population density and clients who are prepared to pay the extra buck for this.
The vast majority of the polulation in a few ""rich"" countries won't be able to use driverless cars, not to mention the rest of the world.

3. Who is losing out?
Basically there is no difference between a Uber car , a taxi, or a driverless car. You book the lift,  pick up , and something brings you to a certain destination.
But the driver job feeds a lot of people, as a full time or part time driver. These guys work hard and pay taxes (as we know that this is not so certain for the biggest companies). 
The dream of the driverless car developers is of course to replace all other individual transport services.
In polarized societies it is already difficult for ""less qualified"" people to find work, this is the wrong direction! No society needs more unskilled workers. 
Another burden for taxpayers? Or more people on the streets?

4. Reasonable investment for future generations?
In times of increasing extreme climate events, droughts, other man-made desasters, still huge areas without proper education,  and many more problems, 
it would have been wiser to use the billions of dollars already burnt for driverless car development for education, environment and sustainable energy research and deployment instead.

Only the tech hype ""cool what this can!"" does not justify mindless wase of money in gigantic proportions for show, shareholder value, and some possible benefits for a small group of ""cool"" people in ""cool"" places.

I undersatand that it is important for professional YouTube content producers to monetize their work. 
This video is but such a cheap, biased and unreflected work and does not fit to the often mentioned high journalistic standards of this channel.

This video is the very first instance and I have spent substantial time near the Waymo depot in addition to watching them drive around my city for years.

On the other hand, I've rented a Tesla model S with FSD beta enabled for an entire week and used that to drive around the northern Virginia area. I was more attentive in the waymo vehicle because I knew I had zero ability to get involved aside from asking the vehicle to stop where the Tesla actually allowed me to relax a bit more with the knowledge I still could take over if I had the need. Considering the costs I've seen so far, waymo would make no sense unless you were writing it infrequently and unless their team pulls out the secret weapon I would pull out (George and Elon were both right and yet missed the bigger picture), it's hard to imagine Waymo being able to provide service over enough area to ever be relevant, especially when compared to what Tesla is already capable of doing with their continuously growing fleet of vehicles, all around the world.

And I think the reason for that is simple I'm already used to do being a car without a driver basically I would be used to it. Because that's how I would have to get used to it anyway. But for me and several other blind people I think that would be a very good idea. Because basically we would need mobility instructors to train us how to use those things. That's what I'd like to see happen. I think we have to have a mobility instructor train us to use self-driving cars. Because for the blind and disabled I think that would work out just fine. Basically we could get around a lot faster than we can taking a bus. Or in this case where I live in here in the Seattle area I'll Link light rail train. Because I can get to my doctor's appointment much quicker than a bus or Link light rail. Because that way it would save me time and it would save me the effort of walking to the bus stop. Because right now since I'm an older person now besides being blind I think this would make it more easier for me to get around. But as far as people in wheelchairs I don't know how that's going to work because they would need a special van for that.

You're talking about sensors, but the issue in the data isn't the sensors, it's the data analysis AND the data. This will get better, but the idea this is solved by simply using a machine is so massively flawed.

Also,  I just noticed you mounted a camera to film from the roof, does this arm it's mounted on not obstruct the LIDAR you just mentioned?

18:07, for the record, this was not a good stop and might have gotten you rear ended.

EXPERIENCE IS NOT EXPERTISE.

Those 8 accidents you talk about are all because we still have human drivers, Waymo putting these on the road will NOT end that, likely NEVER.

20 billion simulation miles are not 20 billion real miles.

This is just an ad without any critical analysis of the downsides.

Transportation will get cheaper? SAYS WHAT???? This a corporation that is for profit, what will they do with a monopoly on transportation?

Why can't we do this as a public venture, not private?

This is a major continuation of the wasted energy of personal vehicles. You don't even TOUCH the idea that mass transit will basically die because of this.

This video ultimately sucks as an objective look at this at all, it's just an ad for Waymo. Look, as a person who can't drive for medical reasons, I'm all for autonomous vehicles, but let's stop with hype clouding reason and deflecting and ignoring legitimate concerns, this isn't the way forward.

Look, I'm all for autonomous vehicles, I'm not for arrogant people like Elon Musk who refuse to use LIDAR as a safety measure and kill people issue betas for new software and testing it with unqualified customers on public roads. I agree this can be better, but not if the focus is profits over safety, and it capitalism, that will ALWAYS BE THE GOAL.

What class of drivers will this technology replace?  Taxi's and Uber, disabled and elderly, yes ... even the ones who already drive safe.  But what about  those who tailgate and weave in and out of traffic?  When they clip a Waymo, disabling a few sensors, will it be able to react appropriately?  What will happen during a road rage incident, say getting Break Checked?  What if 5 autonomous vehicles are driving back to back?  They would leave so much distance (2sec) between each other that they will get cut off by an aggressive driver.  The ensuing deceleration will cause traffic to slow, which will cause even more aggressiveness from human operated vehicles.  Until these issues are addressed I don't think autonomous is ready for general use. (although it will likely happen because politicians are inherently ignorant and easy to bribe with enough campaign contributions and lopsided ""data"").  I'm curious if autonomous vehicles can drive off the road to avoid a multi-car pileup?    Or say the fan belt snaps and the car overheats?  What will it do during a crisis situation?  

I think autonomous today is at the same stage as early air travel.  People used to buy life insurance at the airport before getting on a plane. Air travel is safer now because of the countless improvements made after each disaster. NTSC advocates for air safety, but who will do so for car accidents?

We cannot move forward with this technology if ""ignore the edge cases, those are rare"" is the mindset of the people in charge of it. I sincerely hope that is you injecting your viewpoint onto it and that's not coming from Waymo.

The clip you showed of someone arguing an edge case where it encourages people not to wear helmets is not invalidated by its rareness. People don't act based on statistics. If they did, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in right now in 2021. We don't need to stop pushing autonomous vehicles forward for this helmet question (the system is nowhere near capable enough of accurately identifying safety equipment and making decisions based on it so it's not a relevant question) but other questions DO need to be addressed.

Let me give you a perspective that is a bit more worrying to me. Twice in the past few months we've seen a huge swath of the internet go offline for a few hours when a major cloud host went down. First Google, then Amazon. It's been a wakeup call to some that we've overcentralized our online infrastructure, but others are ignoring it...because of course they are. Just last week we had a zero day where all Apache servers (the most common web server software). The concern with automated driving is it potentially creates a very deadly single point of failure. I don't see that happening with Waymo's current fleet as they are largely autonomous and, importantly, nowhere near the most common vehicle on the road. But let's fast forward to when an automated system controlling vehicles is as common as Toyota vehicles. There are three major issues that need to be clearly addressed before many of us will trust allowing them to grow towards that point.
1. Does it stop working if some external service goes offline - GPS, internet, a server in Toyota's basement, whatever. Obviously, given a certain country it's being developed in, it can currently stand to be without internet for a while because American internet, but we can't get ourselves dependent on a transportation technology that stops functioning entirely if an online service goes down. A smartbulb that won't work anymore because the server discontinued is a small inconvenience, but if Ford goes under and shuts off servers their vehicles depend on, that can result in a lot of slow and painful deaths. 
2. Can the fleet be compromised. The talk of cars that communicate with each other sounds great...unless you work in computing. Then it sounds like someone forgot bad people exist. That sort of inter-connectivity is like handing the nuclear codes to anyone who figures out or is told how to send commands to those cars. If someone figured out how to send the command to accelerate over that communications system (which, even if the communications system doesn't convey commands is still possible) then millions could die within hours.
3. Can individual cars be attacked. For a while, many banks and credit card companies were putting wireless chips in cards and insisting it was ""safe"". Security experts demonstrated a small loop of wire that could fit in someone's pocket, along with a small control device could pull all the needed information off the cards from a distance and reproduce it on demand. Now those chips aren't in most cards anymore. A few manufacturers are desperately claiming theirs are ""safe"" but few are gullible enough to believe them now. This one is going to have to be demonstrated, not merely assured. Something like letting a few hacker conventions have at the vehicle on a closed course where they won't have any qualms about making it do things that would otherwise be lethal. This one is more for avoiding unnecessary roadblocks. We don't want car manufacturers to get gunshy about automated software like banks did with the card chips. Yes, you can get people to quickly trust the car to drive, but it can just as quickly generate distrust and outrage if one person gets killed because a malicious individual tricked the vehicle into doing something wrong. You would also need to test against large scale shutdown attacks such as saturating an area with the right frequency of light that the LIDAR is using or painting something with a material that scatters or absorbs that light.

Saving lives is a good goal, but if you leave the door open to losing more lives, or if you rush forward so fast that you stumble and slow down the process, then you've done a disservice. Being better than what we have now isn't good enough. We have to work through the ramifications of it to avoid unintended consequences.

Many years ago, people worked out that putting lead in gasoline would solve a major problem. And an entire generation got lead poisoning from that. Unintended consequences can be disastrous beyond your wildest dreams, especially for something as ubiquitous as transportation. We need this technology to succeed, not be held back by early failures that could have been anticipated if we had listened to the people we thought were just naysayers.",16,,True,none,"['Ford', 'Waymo']"

Equating ""driverless elevators"" with driverless cars is ridiculous (and the bogus claim that ""there was one guy who was like 'I don't care if I have to walk up 12 flights of stairs for the rest of my life; I'm not taking that elevator'"" is just laughably weak.  ""Yes, don't be like that crazy guy, folks!"").  What were the potential risks of riding in an elevator without an operator?  (1) falling to your death, (2) being crushed by doors that don't close while it's in motion, or (3) ending up on the wrong floor.  Are ANY of those as likely as a driverless car going 70 mph colliding with a car that's merging into your lane?  NOPE.  Making elevators immune from the 3 risks listed took electromechanical engineers of the 1920s a couple of years.  That's it.  It wasn't until WWII when elevator operators (who had frequently gone on strike to protect their jobs from being eliminated by automation) were finally dispensed with as unnecessary.  

Comparing them with airline autopilots is likewise nonsensical.  Autopilots (or ""flight management systems"") use things that driverless cars cannot, such as the fact that every commercial aircraft has a flight-plan that is filed ahead of time, so they can be networked to avoid collision.  No such thing will happen with driverless cars.  When an aircraft is in flight, other than during takeoff or landing, the main dangers to avoid are terrain (when in doubt, gain altitude), and bad weather (weather systems are _large_ and avoiding them is hardly brain surgery).  This is _nothing_ like the constantly evolving, real-time dangers that self-driving cars *that must move in very tightly-defined vehicle lanes* must contend with, from unpredictable drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, animals (wile and domestic), obstacles like blown-over signs, lost loads, stray wheels, garbage, sand, etc., that plague roadways.  So Waymo (and Derek) are presenting an _utterly false equivalency_ with autopilots.

As with EVERY new technology, driverless cars are being oversold on best-case scenarios, and worst-case scenarios are being swept under the rug.  Remember how computers were going to be ""foolproof"" electronic brains?  Remind me how that worked out.  Within a few years of the proliferation of the networked PC, everything from viruses to coronal mass ejections were wreaking havoc.  Has your cell phone EVER failed?  Of course it has.  In most cases, it's just an inconvenience (albeit a frustrating one).  Do you actually believe that self-driving cars or the networks that connect them will be immune to things like glitches, hacks, system failures, bad patches, exploits, malware, ""blue screens of death"", etc.?  If so, you haven't been paying attention to the past 25 years of high-tech reality.  Any one of those things could cripple a self-driving car, cause it to crash, or cause an entire network to go down, bringing thousands of self-driving cars to a standstill.  They will *also* become very attractive targets for ransomware and cyberattacks.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

I'll also admit that I only rediscovered this video courtesy of Tom Nicholas. I am a Veritasium subscriber. Also, the comments section doesn't need another person either saying ""Genius!"" or shouting ""Corporate shill!"" 

I do think there is a big difference between a short segment advertising a product unrelated to the video and a whole video sponsored by a company who is the subject of that video. I am disappointed that Derek doesn't seem to acknowledge that this might be a reasonable point of view.

That disappointment has two facets: (1) I like to view Veritasium as a trusted source and (2) I think there as some ways to significantly mitigate this but they depend on the content creator buying in

Classy things I think Derek could do might include:
(1) Clearly labelling whole sponsored videos in a *noticeably different* way to those with sponsored segments (to awaken the critical thinking faculties of part-time morons like me)
(2) Clearly specify (even if only in the description) what the nature of sponsorship agreement was: were there any rejected sections? How much editorial control did they get? Did they impose any long-lasting/widespread clauses that might affect other videos? Was this a one-off or is this the start of a long-lasting collaboration?

I guess some sponsors might have issues with even these. The decision the Veritasium guys will have to make is whether allowing this sort of thing into the channel like this is compatible with their stated ideals.",2,,True,none,['Waymo']

Roads are sometimes meh, weather is quite difficult for LIDARs and cameras, traffic is heavy and fast and drivers are... Well, let's say I felt way more comfortable riding a *self-driving* taxi than some of the normal ones. Maybe Yandex Self-Driving Cars are doing so well specifically thanks to the challenge, developers have to act smart and quite paranoid. Once I saw a video of a Waymo car stopping because it started raining a bit, and was like ""Wut?"", because in Moscow you might as well not bother leaving the garage if you can't handle such weather.
Note that I worked at Yandex Self-Driving Group (a year ago) and participated in developing those cars, and even knowing how ""raw"" the technology was on the inside didn't scare me. Yes, it might take closer to a decade to surpass a ""professional driver in an ideal state of mind and health"", but I'd guess the autopilot already is safer than most taxi drivers. It has reaction time so short that humans can't even dream of getting close, and can ""see"" so much more with its sensors than two eyes and a couple mirrors could possibly allow. And if it fails, it is far more likely to just stop, maybe cause a traffic jam until a human intervenes, and that's it.
As far as I know, the only road accidents involving Yandex cars were pretty much them stopping at the traffic lights and getting hit from behind by some texting-at-the-wheel idiot who failed to stop.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

A lot of her time is wasted going to the start point of public transport, switching public transport and from end point to final destination. However, this technology is only viable if it's truly autonomous 100% of the time. That means not only must it be able to navigate all kinds of obstacles like roadworks and accidents, but also all kinds of weather. (Rain still seems to be a problem for Waymo sensory systems.) A lot of road infrastructure has to be either changed or augmented to accommodate these vehicles. For example traffic regulatory systems (traffic lights, speed signs, etc) need some way of communicating with the vehicle as well as communication between vehicles. Also for better or worse a lot of legislation has to be done. (It took literally centuries to come up with road rules.) And we as a society have to accept that small and major accidents will happen. I also imagine that ""car ownership"" is going to be an issue. It looks that Tesla bets that cars will be still owned by the majority of individuals, while the rest (Alphabet, Ford, etc) assumes that a ""car as a service"" is the more likely outcome. I can imagine that we might not even have individual cars in the future, but something that is a hybrid between car, bus and train.

I'm just here because I saw that video by Tom and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Frankly, I'm underwhelmed. I don't see anything to be outraged about. On several points I feel like Tom's critique was unfair. Even little stuff like Derek's ""shrug"" after saying ""full disclosure..."". There was no shrug. The look on his face was at best ambiguous. It didn't read to me as dismissive. I really hate little jabs like that because you feel petty/nitpicky in correcting them but they aren't accurate. Or where Tom critiques Derek's ""spinning"" the vehicle stopping for a pedestrian as a good thing. I didn't notice any ""spinning"", I don't see a problem with his discussion of it at all.

  But on more substantive parts I also find lacking. One of the central complaints Tom has is that Derek never addresses that Waymo only works in Phoenix. But he does address it, at 1:36. The critique about omission, to me, was the most egregious. This is a central problem of creating a short ""edutainment"" video. You have to omit a ton. It's an 18 minute video. Of course Derek didn't go into an explanation of deep learning and training algorithms and whatever else. It's supposed to be an entertaining video. It's also never been the style of the channel (at least as best I remember) to give a nuanced view. It's always a very upbeat fun video about the positives or interesting part of some sciency topic. His target audience really has always felt to me to be very broad. That's part of why he's not really my cup of tea. I personally like getting into the nitty gritty and the nuance and exploring the various sides of these subjects. But that's not really what he does. It more feels like he's trying to inspire interest and leave you with a positive or even hopeful feeling.

 And on the point of omission, I felt like Tom's dismissal of the airplane and elevator arguments was somewhat comical. Elevators don't count because they travel on only one dimension. And airplanes don't count because.. Hang on, airplanes are three dimensions, shouldn't they count extra or something!? Why did Tom omit that? Isn't that ""misinformation by omission""? Are dimensions really that important to Tom, or was it just a convenient way to dismiss a point? One could imagine the argument in reverse, ""sure we automated cars, they are only in two dimensions no way we could automate airplanes, they are in three dimensions!"" I do agree that cars are the harder problem, but that's why they are being solved last. We are making use of much more complex technology to solve it. Elevators required very little and were automated around 1900, planes required more the first commercial planes with autoland entered service in the early 1960s, and cars require a dizzying amount and for last 15 years or so have felt 5 years off. 

This is not to say I found all of Derek's arguments convincing. For example, parking vehicles less won't necessarily decrease the total numbers of cars produced. If we park a vehicle half as often, it actually needs to drive significantly more, because it needs to drive empty between people during the downtime. Total miles increases, and vehicles have lives measured in miles. If everything else is equal, total number of cars required in a country per year goes up not down. You have other issues as well, experts predict usage would go way up without the need for drivers, which would also need more (just imagine if you could just go to sleep and wake up in the morning at the Grand Canyon, imagine how many road trips you'd go on). A lot of autonomous cars are all electric cars, and they tend to last longer than gasoline engines, which would mean less cars produced. Less wrecks would would mean less cars produced. In net total I'm not sure. I don't think this is an example of bias from advertisement though. I think it's just an example of surface level analysis that comes with an entertaining YouTube video. 

  For what it's worth I don't really like advertisement in general, but especially when there is a potential conflict of interest, and doubly so when it's native advertising. But I just don't really see any evidence that Veritasium handled it irresponsibly.",0,UgxPpjQ1DJGqRfhKsUJ4AaABAg,True,none,['Waymo']

I agree with you on all accounts but one: I still stick to the forecast that self-driving vehicles won't become even remotely ""mainstream"" any sooner that 10-15 years from now. The technology is here, now; it is functional, and it works. Nevertheless, when it comes to roads, vehicles, drivers, traffic, environment, weather, and all possible related variables and conditions, the world is an exceedingly diverse place! 20 milion miles in Chandler, AZ (or wherever it is that Waymo performed most of their testing) mean nothing in relation to driving around in Mumbai (India), Manila (Philippines), Bogot√† (Colombia), or even Istanbul (Turkey). No disrespect intended: I am Italian, Italians are awful drivers, aggressive and undisciplined. Before we can say ""We have self-driving cars!"", I'd like to see the results of 20 million miles driving during the monsoon season in a city where traffic is frantic and congested 24x7 by a folly of old, scarcely maintained vehicles (ranging from 1 to 20+ wheels :) many of which are self-built and without homologation of any kind, driven by hasty drivers with exactly ZERO training! ;)",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

Furthermore there is the general issue that your safety is also at risk if the car gets hacked or gets malware installed on it. You mentioned that the car stops for sirens, but there have been incidents where criminals pretend to be police officers and pull people over to rob them; would it stop for a fake siren too?

Do you trust them around your autonomous vehicle? And then we have companies like Tesla who are out-right lying about their autonomous driving modes ... it becomes a huge mess of ethics and business priorities. Who is liable if your autonomous vehicle kills someone? What if it gets hacked? What if auto vehicles get a virus which causes them to do stupid things on the road? The vehicles become a HUGE black box where most normal people (users or owners) wouldn't even know how to fix them and or take care of them. So, naturally, you have to totally eliminate vehicle ownership ... you must then rely on companies like Waymo to transport all humans ... and now you've restricted your freedom of travel to the routes they have programmed.... you see where this is going? Unfortunately, for autonomous vehicles to truly work well, human vehicle ownership needs to go, therefore putting all your freedom of movement in the hands of a.i. and companies making such a.i. ... this isn't a good thing, humans are already losing crucial life-sustaining skills with every new generation, how many people do you know can hunt or farm their own food today? Exactly ... So now, with auto-driving we are further reducing the general human ability by taking away common motor-skills from people... I just don't feel like this will lead to a better future. Motor-skills, situational awareness, decision making under pressure and so on are important human skills to have and maintain - even if they lead to some accidents in the process, you will NEVER be 100% safe. IMHO, your airplane comparison is really invalid, planes aren't really worried about ""traffic"" or pedestrians, AND, pilots go through INSANE (and very expensive) training and licensing before they can engage the ""auto pilot"" button on a 747. Unfortunately, the roads aren't as empty as the skies...  Finally, if COVID taught us anything, it is that the government is in absolute control over our travels and whereabouts, should we REALLY give them even more power, i.e. the ability to disable all autonomous cars with a click of a button when they don't want us to move around like they grounded all airplanes and stopped travel between nations with the stroke of a pen? I STILL can't see my family because of international travel restrictions, it has been 17+ months and here I am at the mercy of some douche bag in office to see my loved ones ... I personally don't think this is a good idea - it's not a future I want. Your freedoms trump my safety, and we as humans shouldn't be looking for more reasons to be lazy and incompetent (such as sleeping in our cars while they drive us home)...

It is a very interesting topic. Let me clear something out first. I am fully onboard for autonomous cars. What trips me a bit (and probably people who are trying to find evidence against autonomous cars) is all these claims of 20 million miles. How much more experience this is compared to a regular driver. Objectively speaking this is true. But on the other hand, you Derek said it yourself - this car will probably struggle on poorly maintained roads for example. And yet, myself a driver with only 130 000 km of experience (basically a rookie compared to this car) have no problem whatsoever driving on poorly maintained road or on a dirt road.

I am software engineer and I have tried to explain the benefits of self driving cars to people and I see a very common set of misconceptions.
What people seem to struggle to understand is that computer algorithm driving a car will be MUCH better than a human in 99% of the situations. The problem is that in the remaining 1%, due to their nature, computers tend to make mistakes that seem so obvious for us humans that we apply our confirmation bias and shot down the idea.

The thing is, as you said 99% of mistakes are basically not obeying the traffic laws or getting intentionnaly or unintentionally distracted. A computer will never do that. The thing is us humans alwasy think ""yeah, that will never happen to me, so I dont see the benefit for myself!"". The computer being a giant calculator looking for patterns might (in 1 in a million) find a pattern where there shouldn't be and execute a maneuver that may result in an accident. This is what we see with Tesla and with virtually any other brand at some point. The car driving seemingly perfect and  just make a turn and leave the road or simply ignore a stopped vehicle and cause an accident. This is the nature of algorithms. Poorly programmed or trained model could make such a mistake. Of course a human would react like ""WTF the car just made a right turn on the highway and got out of the road, a human would never make such a stupid mistake!"".

Of course such a mistake would be against (probably 100 000 mistakes on the human side) making it so extremely rare that statistically it is not even worth discussing.

My point with this long comment is that sometimes in their attempt to promote their progress, companies like Waymo make a big bold statement like ""we have 20 million miles of experience, much more than a human"" that they provoke a reaction like ""Oh yeah, 20 million miles, huh? I drove for 20 000 and I can drive on a poorly mainteined road and you cant!""

Maybe a bit more transparancy on what those numbers mean in reality and a bit more education on how things work and why they are better even though they seemingly sometimes make not the best judgements from the perspective of a human driver might push things in the right direction. A quick example is the quck sudden squeeking stop infront of the man with the cart. This kind of a stop is to be expected from a very rookie driver and even though I fully understand why such things happen, people will tend not to expect such ""attitude"" from someone or something that has droven 20 million miles.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Can current technology alone improve this 10x? Even then it would just match humans. Sensor resolutions in silicon are still not matching the human apparatus. Self driving is going to be a better cruise control for a while. In fact properly designed advanced cruise control has been shown to reduce accident rates in highways.

(Best I can recall is an offhand comment that the roads are well maintained.)

Phoenix was chosen for a reason - it has excellent driving weather, the roads aren't too complicated, and the traffic isn't particularly heavy. And, even with all those advantages, I believe that Waymo relies on their own exhaustive (cm-scale?) mapping of the entire service area (eg. so the car knows where the road is), and I don't think this approach is particularly scalable.

Yes, it's exciting that it can work at all, and it gives me a lot of hope for the future. But I think it's a long way from the eventual goal of driverless cars being safe to use on arbitrary roads.

There's one huge unsolved problem though, and it's not a technical issue.

When a driverless car makes a mistake, who pays for it?

Our entire accountability infrastructure is built around the assumption that the driver is responsible for everything the car does.  If you take the driver out of the equation, our fundamental assumptions about liability fall to pieces.  Waymo gets around this by having every step in the chain from engineering to practice in the hands of a single entity.

I am more concerned about the liability and the human factor. If a train or a plane crashes, killing people on board, the company operating those vehicles is (or should be) held liable for damages. For human factor concerns, consider that when you are a passenger in a car, you take some mental comfort in knowing the driver is putting himself at risk in the car with you, so there is some shared comfort in knowing that (most of the time) the risk is shared equally by both the operator of the vehicle and the passenger. A similar situation presents itself in military situations - ground troops have expressed that they prefer manned air support over unmanned air support due to the fact they take some comfort knowing someone else is also risking their life with them in the situation, rather than some drone pilot halfway around the earth - drones are quite soulless and that is not reassuring when you are on the ground under fire. Regarding personal driverless vehicles and driverless taxi services like Waymo, I'll feel more confident when laws regarding liability are explicitly more robust than they currently are. Nothing against the technology, and I have no issues with the statistical evidence driving the march toward driverless vehicles - computers are more reliable, statistically.

It's wonderful technology though and we need the government to subsidise it to accelerate its widespread adoption. The economic benefits couldn't be clearer. 

I'm personally betting that Tesla will solve autonomy L5 that will over time just get better and better. Do not underestimate the power of Neural Nets and Machine Learning. If you're in any doubt then watch AlphaGo on Netflix or YouTube.

I think it is not random that Waymo picked a city with lots of sunshine, little rain, no snow, and no dirt roads.  My friends in rural Vermont find the notion of driverless cars to be a pipedream.  In a bad snowstorm with ice on the the road, will all the cars just stop?  Will this mean that some areas will off limits to driverless cars?  When 95% of the population lives in a driverless environment and you need to drive in the rest of the area how do the populations go from one area to another?    Will we able to move around without our every movement being traced?  How will all this be regulated?  If Google or Amazon  or Uber end up becoming the monopoly that controls driverless cars will we be totally at their mercy?

The opportunity cost of driving would also reduce to almost nothing, removing disincentives to travel. Do you take the children to visit the grandparents, one hour away by car? Wouldn't you do it more often, if it didn't entail two hours of actual driving?

Me, a mechanic who actually enjoys driving: ""I don't trust anything I can't fix. The more computers you cram into an automobile, the easier it is to brick.""

On a completely different note, I love the freedom that comes with an automobile. The freedom to travel and explore on a scale that our ancestors could barely dream of. I don't want to surrender that freedom to a computer, or the tech company that built it.

Looking at the modern obsession with safety, it seems to me that, barring a cultural reversal or a catastrophic shakeup in the geopolitical scene, that in thirty years politicians are going to mandate driverless features. It will be like the seatbelt. At first it is optional, then it is mandatory to be installed, and then you get ticketed for not having it installed. That freedom to roam is going to be taken away, locked behind the car's interface.

I am safe enough. I am responsible for what I do on the road, and I am not going to relenquish that responsibility to a computer.

So, no thanks. I'm not buying what you are selling, for reasons you probably never considered.

PS: your sixty million deaths statistic is nonsense. Big numbers taken from worldwide populations over long periods of time are meaningless. Take the sixty million who have died on the streets, and compare with the number of people who have died from heart failure or disease in the same time span.

Waymo is ""better"" but not that much better.

20 million miles means virtually nothing when many of them occurred in Chandler which has wide, straight roads. Low traffic density. Virtually no pedestrians or animals, and sunny clear weather 350 days a year. Also, many of those miles took place in 2020 when nobody was on the road anyway. This is as close to controlled ""lab conditions"" as one can get, albeit still forcing the general public to participate in a technology experiment without their consent (Nuremburg has some words on that). Throw in dense traffic, high pedestrian density, snow, fog, deer, roads designed for horses with blind turns, etc and we've trained cars to self drive in the least common driving scenarios found on the planet.

I like how he talks about airplane autopilot like it's a guarantee safety feature and TOTALLY ignores Boeing and the 737 Max crashes that killed hundreds because the technology was not thoroughly tested before being deployed. This is a major problem with autonomous vehicles as a whole, a bug in the code is one thing on your smartphone, it's a wholly separate issue when it turns a two ton piece of machinery into an eradict and potentially lethal projection. It's one thing when there's a ""bug"" in a human but that human can be held accountable and is only responsible for their individual vehicle, it's a huge problem when that bug is instantly propogated across millions of vehicles and can't be overriden by the drivers (or they aren't expecting to need to override the systems...a stark contrast from pilots that are highly trained and paid to always be attentive). That's not even to address the cybersecurity issue, and we all know how great silicon valley is about cybersecurity.

Computers are great at being consistent, but the road is anything but consistent. Even without drivers there are too many variables from construction, to debris, to weather, to pedestrians that make the road chaotic. The sky is comparably far less complex as there's air traffic control, radar, a whole third dimension to maneuver in, and less objects to collide with as a whole. Humans on the other hand are terrible at being consistent, but fantastic at handling novel situations. That's not to say that self driving cars are a fool's errand, it's just to say that the technology is not ready for public roads and never should have been allowed (the algorithms don't even have to pass a driver's test like a 15 year old kid has too). Even experts in the industry are coming out and saying the technology is farther away than anticipated, many saying at least a decade away. Remember, we were supposed to have self driving cars by 2020 when the tech was first being hyped, and it's still in it's infancy with only one company having road trials (in the most lax regulatory state with the easiest road conditions). Even then, the cars drive erratically and get into collisions, where WAYMO refuses to disclose any contextual information about the events, and I've personally seen them constantly driving bike lanes. It seems like self driving cars might go the way of flying cars and cold fusion, a decade away, every decade.

Another issue is that they're comparing safety to the average american driver, which is a poor standard as we can pretty easily surmise that self driving cars will be replacing commercial and luxury vehicles first, two demographics that statistically are the safest drivers with millions of miles between collisions. In other words, the algorithms need to be far safer than the average driver to not LOWER average road safety in the adoption phase (these are things actuaries are already concerned about and they don't care about hype or promises, just raw data and risk).

Lastly, this all ignores a huge elephant in the room: cities designed around private individual cars, whether autonomous and electric or not, is a poor design model. Changing who and how a car drives does nothing to address the well studied problems that cities based on individual driving ALWAYS suffer more traffic, more pollution, more urban sprawl, more heat island, and more climate change problems. Technology, whether wider roads, or safer and faster cars, has never realized the promises made to sell the technology. The only things that do alleviate the problems of urban and suburban traffic are increased public mass transportation, and actively discouraging individual drivers. Imagine how bad the roads are going to be when all these autonomous vehicles are not kept in the garage but rather ""rented"" out with some kind of driverless Lyft service. Cars on the road could easily double as they all idle waiting for a fare, rather than sitting parked. Oh yeah, work from home is a far easier, cheaper, and faster to implement way to address the dangers of road, but it doesn't create a bunch of BS jobs to make a fundamentally flawed system appear less flawed without dramatically fixing anything (seat belts, crumple zones, and assisted driving/braking have already addressed the vast majority of the dangers of driving anyway).


I want autonomous vehicles, I'd love to not have to pay attention on road trips and not have to fly nearly as much. I'm pro the technology, but just because I'm for something doesn't mean the technology is anywhere near ready and should be ""generally regarded as safe"" just because we want it. That's the same logic that created Thalidomide or Theranos or so many failed kickstarters. Hype isn't the same as reality and technologists need to stop treating potentially lethal technology as a benign advancement with no risks.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Aircraft? You can't compare those to cars. Of course aircraft are much safer when flown using automatic systems because they are complex things and not driving down 2D roads. But on autoland, the plane just flies down a glide path that's been cleared by air traffic control and is illuminated by a radio beacon, and that's a much simpler thing to do than driving a car through a busy city in a rainstorm. So simple in fact that the basic system was developed over 80 years ago.

Oh, and talking about rainstorms, could it be just a coincidence that Waymo only operates in one of the driest places in the US? Currently, they can only function in ""light rain"" because Lidar just doesn't like rain. Rain appears as noise in the reflected image and greatly reduces the system's range and accuracy. A really good AI might be able to compensate for this, so let me know when Waymo have driven 20 million miles down freeways in torrential rain and I might be less dismissive.

And you can pooh-pooh trolley problems all you like, but they do exist in real life. Say a deer runs out in front of me on a fast, busy road. If the system brakes hard, the car behind might run into me, but if it doesn't brake, the deer might come through the windshield and kill me. I'm NOT saying that I could make a better decision, for all I know, the Waymo system might estimate the mass of the deer and compare the kinetic energy of the collision to the deformation strength of the bodywork and so on, but ultimately it will have to make the decision, and it's a potentially life-or-death one.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

And most importantly, it doesn't work in rain or any other adverse weather conditions. Even heavy smog and dust can incapacitate it.

Those Waymo cars literally can only work under the weirdly ideal Californian weather conditions and are totally useless anywhere else, so it is really questionable what those people think they are doing.

It's the same issue I have with Uber (and taxis in general). I didn't learn to drive until I was 36 years old as I'd always lived in a city and just never felt the need, taxis and public transport was abundant and easy. Then I moved to a rural area when I was 32, for years I had to put up with not being able to get an Uber, to having to wait an hour for a bus or a train (if it didn't get cancelled, which it frequently did) and struggling to get a taxi. So I learned to drive and bought a car and it completely changed my life.

Now, if self-driving cars come out soon then I'll be getting one the moment I can afford it, I'd love one BUT I probably wouldn't be interested in services like Waymo - at least not until they are ubiquitous - as you just know that the rural areas won't be getting the same level of service as the cities for a LONG time. I highly doubt that we will eliminate personal ownership of vehicles - self-driving or otherwise - for at least 30-40 years. Right now, I can jump in my car, go to the supermarket, do a shop and be home within 30 mins (15 if it is just a quick pop in and out) - before driving I had to set aside 2 hours for that same trip and even though that was giving myself extra time for taxi/bus troubles, it actually took that long (or even occasionally longer) far too often.

That and I was also involved in two rear end collisions both where my vehicle was stopped. The first at a traffic light, the guy behind me thought the light in his lane changed because cars in the left turn lane started moving. The other was when traffic came to a stand still on the freeway and the next car struck me at close 55mph. I personally was to blame for the three additional accidents during my 17 years as a taxi driver. I calculate that during that time I drove over 2,386,800 miles. I used the average of 5 days a week although I often worked 6-7 days a week for most of those years. I often worked 12-16 hours, I even have worked 3 days straight, napping between trips. The naps allowed me to get enough sleep that I did not need quit working to as much 17-18 hours per day. That being said 6 possibly 7 accidents (in case I forgot one) in 17 years years prove I am above average. I however know a more amazing driver that I aspired to be like, my own father. He drove from his home to work and back from his job to home every day for more than 20 years, roughly 22-23 years, and still transported his family to shopping and other places as fathers often do. A trip to work for him was 62 miles, sometimes more, because in the summer he would take a 10-12 mile detour on his way to work to drop me, my brother or sister to grandma's house on his way to work, or pick us up on the way home. He was involved in accidents, but all of the were the OTHER persons fault. He had zero accidents to his name in over 20+ years. I miss my old man, but I still aspire to drive as good as him. There were man times I watched in amazement as an eminent accident was avoided by him pulling some crazy maneuver that somehow slipped us through a gap, around a swerving vehicle and avoiding a seemingly avoidable accident.

There was a time when I would have eaten this up. I still kindof agree, but I just cant totally.  Watch the video from just within the last few years of the dude testing out his Model 3 crossing left on a 3 lane road. He runs trials with it, recording w/ a drone setup and multiple cameras to test out FSD and report bugs. He probably brought it to that turn 2 dozen times, and numerous times the car completely misread it and he had to mash the brake. Now I realize that Tesla doesn't offer the same level of autonomy as Waymo, but I just wish you discussed the limitations of driverless tech in general. The pros and cons of Lidar, cameras, what kind of things cause autonomous cars to get confused and crash, and the ethics of having a loved one die due to their own or someone else's mistake on the road vs them being a casualty of computer error. Its too bad the sponsorship probably prevented that discussion. When you asked the ultimate question of the episode, ""are they better than the average human?"" it would've been nice to hear a more fleshed out answer instead of only an enthusiastic ""yes"" from a Waymo engineer and some arguably out of context statistics. These things aren't perfect, and the sunny suburbs of Phoenix arent exactly representative of your average road in America. Maybe talk to some transportation board officials or something.

There is however legal limitations to level 4 in all countries, except for a few projects such as the Waymo.

Even my 4 year old Hyundai is at level 2. 

Now, that really has no bearing on your original question. The question of AP usage in crashes has come up numerous times, and while the legalities might become challenging at Level 5, which is rather limited if you still need to have a legally responsible human designated for each trip. (Certified, sober, awake, probably seated in the left front seat), there are lots of lots of interesting cases from the aviation world of where the responsibility crosses over from the Pilot in command (airline representative) to the manufacturer or the designer of the automated system involved in an accident. 

The question about data integrity likewise has come up both in the aircraft-world (Famously as early as Air France 296) but also with Tesla having had more than a few drivers blame their auto pilot when their right foot got too heavy, or when they opted to comment on you tube videos rather than watching the road, even when accepting full legal responisibility when enabling auto pilot. The integrity of the data itself has never really been put into question when reviewed by courts. It is not the easiest ¬´document fraud¬ª out there. 

It would be very hard to manipulate data in a way that wouldn‚Äôt contradict evidence pulled from other potential sources such as dash cams, witnesses, surveillance cams, the damages to the car and other vehicles, there are also inter-car comunication being developed, (ITS/Vanet/IVC type V2V-solutions)so within few years, the car would have comunicated quite a lot of data about its status to nearby vehicles that can be pulled and used as evidence. It would potentially damage the manufacturer in to oblivion if caught only once tampering with such data.

There are rules of the road and right-of-way for when you're stopped at a stop sign. You shouldn't ever have to flag someone through, though I know you do have to sometimes. But it should follow the rules of driving and wait for it's turn.

And I don't think it'll get stuck waiting for pedestrians or cyclists to cross, it'll slow down and might stop abruptly like shown in the video, but if they don't make any move to start crossing it'll start moving again, though probably slowly. Just like and normal driver does when they're waiting.

If it's that the person or people are in the way, then like a normal driver it'll honk the horn or just move around them giving them a safe distance as long as it's safe to do so.


I completely agree with weather, I'm not sure about Waymo specifically, but I know other self-driving AI had a LOT of problems with poor weather.

The other thing I'd add for a concern is something someone else pointed out in another comment on this video: how does it fare with directed traffic. Like when there's an accident or some construction work being done on the road someone directs the traffic. How would it handle being waved through by a police officer without any signs, or how does it work with someone with the proper signs? Or what about just a random person flagging traffic?

Or, at least, I _hope_ that won't happen. As you briefly glossed over towards the end, most accidents with autonomous vehicles are going to happen because other drivers mess up, and cities are precisely where there are going to be the largest concentration of potentially error-prone human drivers. An ideal situation from a safety standpoint is actually the fully-autonomous vehicles becoming more common in suburbs and slowly moving into the cities. Kudos to Waymo for the intensive testing and realizing that half-measures won't work with our stupid ape brains, though; I'm remembering Tesla putting cars on the road that _did_ , in fact, hit stationary objects, and people doing ridiculous things (even filming a porn!) in their partially-autonomous vehicles. Anyway, hopefully they're right that autonomous vehicles reduce fatalities even in the face of human error, because, to touch on your analogies, that's the _real_ reason pilots are required to be in the cockpit during takeoff and landing. Fog isn't much of an obstacle to a computer with a perfect map of the runway system and knowledge of its own x,y,z coordinates, velocity, and acceleration; however, another aircraft with no autopilot or a sudden malfunction can cause collisions without a pilot to end the landing program and move out of the way. (That's also why the elevator analogy isn't a very good one: The most complicated part of driving or piloting is maneuvering around other drivers and pilots, which isn't something an elevator operator ever had to worry about.)

You're definitely skipping over the main reason that we won't be above 50% autonomous cars in the next five or even ten years, though: Economics. In ten years, I _might_ be able to afford a ten-year-old human-driven electric car (but probably not). It'll be even longer before I can afford an autonomous car. And I'm only hovering slightly above the poverty line; there's plenty of people well into poverty who need a car to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads; and even people who are safely lower-middle class don't tend to have _new_ cars, just not-quite-as-old used cars. Most people don't have new cars, because new cars are expensive, and new cars with the latest technology features are more expensive still. The average car on the road in the US is a decade old right now (actually, 12.1, but just coming out of lockdown, the economy's still a bit out of whack, bumping the average up a bit; it was hovering in the high 11.x before that), meaning many are even older.

Also, that motorcyclist with/without a helmet scenario isn't a very good one to begin with, and whoever made the video you clipped from also misunderstood the point of such scenarios. It's actually not a question of how well the car will perform, so much as it's a question of legal liability. To demonstrate, have a much better and more realistic example: What happens when someone has been tailgating you, and then the person in front of you stops short? The car is probably capable of stopping short to avoid the car in front, causing it to get rear-ended; and it's capable of recognizing the car behind is too close and fast, thus stopping slowly and hitting the car in front. That _isn't_ an uncommon situation, unfortunately, and it's entirely due to human driver error _by other drivers_ , meaning the autonomous car may not be able to avoid it. (No, you don't get to brush that one off with ""unlikely hypothetical scenarios."" I have first- and secondhand experience with _exactly_ that scenario at least five times over.) The sticking point is this: Which scenario is safer for the passengers of all three cars, and should the car potentially seek to preserve its own passenger's safety, even at the expense of another vehicle's driver's life? In that scenario, I can easily imagine a situation where hitting the front car would severely injure the passenger (say, by smashing their face into the dashboard), but getting hit by the rear car would kill the driver (maybe they're not wearing a seatbelt). This is all potentially knowable by the autonomous vehicle, so what heuristic is the best one to use when you know you're going to be in court for your programming someday? Once that choice is made, who gets the blame when someone is injured, partially as the result of that decision? The programmer? The manufacturer? The vehicle's owner? The vehicle's passengers, who presumably chose the route that put it on that road? Again, it's a question of liability, one that should probably be figured out now, but one which, given the way our courts run on precedent, probably won't actually be figured out until it actually happens. However, anyone who uses those scenarios to _criticize_ autonomous vehicles has a fundamental misunderstanding of what the problem actually is.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Before a waymo car can drive on a road the road first has to be 2d and 3d mapped processed and so on before the car is allowed to drive down that raod. After which the car knows every 10th of an inch of the whole street, this way they dont have to worry about anything else than the other things moving, such as people, cars and so on.

This strategy works quite well in suburbs and probably pretty well in bigger cities as well, but youd have to have a extremely detailed map of the entire earth before being able to take a road trip in it to where ever you want.

This is why this looks 100x better that the tesla and why it has all of these sensors, cause it needs to know where it is correlating to the premapped 3d world it has been given. New roads and so on (road construction especially) is therefor also one of the downsides to this strategy, since the car doesnt know what to do when the enviroment doesnt corelate to is map. 

Tesla is trying to do full autonomy, that in real time maps out its environment and surroundings and actively finds the safest yet quickest route to the destination

However, my main fear with self driving cars hasn't been answered at all in this video. how does other traffic respond to self driving cars? it is so much easier to make one self driving car respond to another, especially if they share their training or even know in advance where cars they approach are headed to and at what route... but what about the interaction between self driving cars and humans?
you said 3 pedestrians hit a self driving car that was stationary. why was it stationary? did it suddenly stop where a human driver would not have noticed danger and continued, or sped up, or whatever? self driving cars do respond to situations very differently than humans do, which can throw human traffic off, be it drivers or other traffic. it could also aggravate them and cause those humans to behave dangerously.
so my question is, how safe are self driving cars mixed in with human traffic. I fully believe them that the self driving cars can drive more safely than humans, but what percentage of self driving cars do we need on the road, for the safety gains to be ideal? and most importantly, for today: does a low percentage of self driving cars make the roads more dangerous due to humans making more errors as a result?

They do have drivers in some of them sometimes, but a lot of times, you will see them around neighborhoods, parked and waiting for their next pickup. Uber tried developing here and tried to go too fast with playing catch-up to the Waymo algorithm and eventually stopped their development in Arizona. Waymo has been a slow burn to get to where they are and it's amazing. They had drivers in their cars for a very long time even while the driving AI was being developed because they wanted to have a way to correct for incorrect inputs.

I mean just a few of the current problems of waymo:

1. The scalability. You need to complete map out the city and then run rigorous Simulation + test rides before even thinking about deploying the waymo system there (at least with their current fsd approach). So bringing the system to a new city would potentially take years.

2. Cars are getting stuck often. In difficult situation the car often just stops. There is a team of drivers for every 2-3 waymo cars on the streets, which just shows you how unreliable they are at the moment. They then have to drive to the car and take over manually. Obviously this will get better with time but it would take potentially years until you really would Not need any human backup.

3. The crash statistics might be biased. As the other drivers know, that waymo cars are driverless they may watch out more to them as they don't trust the waymo cars and thus be more careful around them

4. Adverserial attacks. Basically hacking the neural nets by giving them weird inputs like a weird picture. Although not a problem yet (as it is quite difficult and highly theoretical at this point) but a potential hacker might print a weird picture on a banner which then basically completely bricks the car/leads to a crash etc.

Just to name a few critical point I wished where in this video. Don't get me wrong it is astonishing, what tech is able to do and waymos approach is currently the most promising. However this video was just absolutely uncritical, basically just reading a script that waymo gave you, which is really sad.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

If Waymo  thinks driverless car is really possible in near future, then why up to now there is no workable automatic parking system in parking lot of super markets.  A system that is simple enough when the driver drives the car to the super market loading bay and gets off the car.  The car can just be driven by itself to find empty parking space and wait there.  Until the owner calls the car back, the car will be driven by itself to the loading bay and pick the owner up.  This should be more straight forward and less variables.  And this should have a huge demand for all car drivers to solve the jamming near shopping centers.

Are those technology guys avoid the comparatively ""easier and practical"" job (park the car in a fix parking lot) instead to tackle the ""difficult"" one on the high way?  Or this is just the other way round, those technology guys are promoting the easier job (i.e. running on high way) that still have a long way to succeed in order to get more funding?

We see that there is visibly and obviously something missing (a driver) and we naturally get anxious when we feel like something's missing, like when you suddenly get that sinking feeling like you forgot your wallet even when you didn't.

This became apparent to me when you showed footage of you in the firefly. I didn't feel any anxiety at all looking at that interior even though I felt plenty vicariously through the footage of you in the chrysler minivan. The firefly just has a seat for the riders, like a rollercoaster at an amusement park. There's no steering wheel, no driver's seat, no brakes or pedals, and that unconsciously sends a signal to my brain that says ""that's how it's supposed to be, we'll be ok"".

The reason it's only in Phoenix right now isn't just legal. It's because it has some of the most consistently favorable driving conditions out of anywhere in the country. Generally well maintained mostly suburban roads. Less than a third as many days if rain as the national average, and less than a quarter total rainfall. No snow at all. They don't go downtown, just a few suburbs close by. Which is fortunate, as you neglected to mention the cars don't go on any roads with speed limits over 45 and PULL OVER for heavy rain.

It's one thing to say, that they don't need to be perfect in every situation. It's another entirely to suggest that driving on a tiny fraction of ideal roads in ideal condition signifies that they are anywhere close to ready for prime time.

Now let's talk timeline. Suggesting anything less than 10 years is a complete pipe dream for any reasonable level of adoption, for a very simple reason. The average car on the road today is 11.5 years old (ok, mixing average and median here, but surprisingly median was hard to find), and you still can't buy one! So even if a fully autonomous car hit the road TODAY, and it was the only car anyone ever bought ever again, the majority of cars would still have human drivers ten years from now. +/- some percentage for fleets which will see faster adoption, but over 85 percent of Americans drive themselves or carpool, which means they are going to have to buy one.

But we're still missing yet another problem. Even if waymo vans were able to drive on most roads, which they can't, and drive in adverse conditions, which they can't, and drive at highway speeds, which they don't, and they were for sale, which they aren't, nobody would be able to afford them! The CEO of waymo put the cost if a single van at around 180,000 dollars earlier this year. Now sure, if you happen to be one of the biggest companies in the world, you can make yourself a fleet, but the average person, or even a small cab or rides share company? Forget it.

Not just in terms of weather and topography, but in terms of auto manufacturers haven't got their squirrely brained fingers on it.  Yet.

Having driven cars since the 70's, with memories of my dad driving cars from the 50's and 60's, I've seen a lot of changes.  And, if I was a cranky old luddite who hates technology, I wouldn't be watching this video. I'm a child of the Space Race.  I love technology.  But I've seen enough changes to know it's always a two edged sword.  And, in the auto industry, designers love to throw technology around for the sake of it, without thought to whether it actually makes things better or not.  There are simple examples of where this has made things worse.  Touch screens should never have been allowed in cars.

There's little doubt in my mind-- watching how all you nutbars drive-- that taking the human element out of driving is going to make things exponentially safer.  No argument there, and this is where the technology might succeed.  But while this video focuses on overcoming user reticence on the basis of safety, that's not the issue where this technology will fail or succeed.  People around the world see their vehicle as an expression of who they are or, more often than not, who they *want to be*.  Good luck overcoming a century of marketing programming of humans.  The only way to make self driving cars truly safe, and realize the full benefit of them safety wise, is to ban people from driving non autonomous vehicles.  Again, good luck with that. 

And here's the kicker.  Many people look to self driving cars as eliminating all the inefficiencies that drivers bring to roads.  So, rush hours won't be so bad, things will run smooth and your commute will be shorter as a result.  Wrong.  Waymo, I am sure, can't wait to sell advertising.  During your work day, you might say to a co-worker ""Gee, I haven't eaten at Burger King in a long time.""  Your cell phone will give that info to Waymo, and on the way home, you'll be taken by a Burger King or two.

AI learns way more slowly than humans.  Humans are fast learners by comparison.  Consider supervised learning: ImageNet database has 14 million images divided among 1000 classes, or 14 thousand examples per class on average.  Humans learn what a ""cat"" is in way less than 14000 examples.  But a computer AI is so slow to learn, that it needs 14 thousand examples to know a cat from a dog!!! Transfer learning reduces new applications to few-shot but that's still borrowing the learning that AI had to do from another computer at the end of the day.  That's supervised learning, the fastest known, which is relatively fast to learn compared to unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning which are much slower, ridiculously slow to learn. Is RI being used by autonomous driving models?  If so then I tell you what, it's not enough to have 20 billion miles of learning in an automated car. You should tell your viewers that humans are super fast learners compared to AI as it stands in 2021. The learning numbers are not the same as if humans drove 20 billion miles.

High detailed road maps don't exit everywhere and just imagine a road changes without changing the map. I would think that the Hardware on the car itself (Lidar etc.) can recognize this and find a work around, but why go the extra step with the map. 

Teslas (and other ""autonomous cars"") don't rely on that data. These get their data in real time from cameras and sensors. Just imagine the effort (and cost) to maintain those maps, I think this is the weak point for Waymo.

There is a reason why Waymo is doing it's pilot program in Phoenix. Determining how to navigate a vehicle in adverse weather conditions is proving to be a very difficult problem to solve.

IMO autonomy in the sense that you can take a car and put it anywhere where there are road markings will be solved first by Tesla and later on everybody will just license their solution because developing their own would take too much money and time.

If only google (aka waymo) and other tech giants own the automated driving services, they could set whatever prices they want. Even if you could actually buy the car, you'd be at the whim of these companies continuing support, but they could just as easily add a necessary paid subscription or something, in which case you don't really own it.
But there are several other downsides as well. For example, an often repeated opinion (even in this video) is that automated driving would ""solve"" traffic problems, but there are plenty of reasons why that might not be the case. Having all cars automated does not reduce the amount of cars on the street, in fact it might increase it, and while they may be a bit faster and that might improve traffic, it's definitely not a solution. Much better tried and tested methods are city planning with walkable spaces in mind and public transportation. The US is particularly bad in this regard, which gives the impression that people will latch on to this idea of autonomous driving *instead* of actual city planning and train networks.
Autonomous driving has its upsides as well, it's not like this video is a complete lie or anything, I believe anyone who tries to argue against the safety they bring is trying to justify themself too much, but it's not as clearly cut and dry as this video implies.",0,UgzBSEWKUZleDv-ISJ94AaABAg,True,none,['Waymo']

Waymo has 20 million miles experience, which sounds impressive, but Tesla has data from at least 10 billion miles of regular car driving. Tesla FSD works on unmapped streets.

Still, the point of the video is correct. Autonomous driving is very close and will be possible most everywhere within years, not decades.

So, context...

Waymo is able to ""pull over"" for a siren because of the microphone that is integrated.

Elon Musk said that Tesla cars will be able to do the same thing. Some people have talked about it online but most people seem confused due to a absence of ""microphones"" that tesla has on the perimeter of their vehicles. 

I was wondering, 
maybe Tesla could use their ultrasonic sensors to capture harmonic partials of the siren through the receiver and use ai accordingly? I don't know if the sensors have one or two diaphragms for the transmitter and receiver, I can't seem to find this information. I don't know the frequency response of the transducers but I'd assume it will be outside of the human hearing range due to it being an ultrasonic device. 

Would it be possible to use the receiver (transducer) of the ultrasonic sensors to capture harmonic partial frequency content of a siren? I won't go into signal to noise ratios, sensitivity, doppler effect and DSP here. 

I just finished my first year studying sound science and technology at university (So not an expert).

Okay, interesting.

But actually, what I'm immediately interested in, was the fact that there are _three_ teams of people who are required to operate these vehicles in, presumably, Arizona. The fact that the vehicles have no drivers on them does not mean that there are _no_ human judgements involved‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâit's just that it's been outsourced, in this case, to a single corporation, who have three teams, at least, working on them (we see Lety's team here, but are there others?). Who make decisions on who dispatches the vehicles, who handles customer service, and, I presume, who will presumably take over in the event of a failure.

_That's_ what I'd like to know. How many vehicles can these three teams handle? How many hours of work do they do a day, a week? Do they get benefits, are there guarantees that they will be trained, and will continue to be trained and qualified for the work that they'll be doing, which is shepherding these fleets of vehicles? Will the solution scale to the problem? What if all 200+ million vehicles in the United States are replaced by autonomous vehicles? How many teams are we talking about here? What happens if they make mistakes or abuse their position? 

You've made big talk about how 94% of accidents in the United States are caused by human error, and that technology by Waymo will drastically reduce that. Maybe. I'd reframe the argument to point out that what widespread adoption of driverless vehicles means is you're placing the responsibility of reducing the six million accidents a year in the United States to a commercial entity, presumably with deep pockets and the ability to dictate how it'll engage with the legal system in the event of something going wrong.

And just to point out‚Ä¶ 6% (i.e., the amount of accidents _not_ attributed to human error) of six million accidents is 360,000. 6% of _that_ , i.e. the percentage of accidents with at least one human fatality, is _at least_ 21,600 dead people. What's the order of magnitude that companies like Waymo are guaranteeing that they'll reduce? Are we talking about reducing the deaths by a thousand times? 21 deaths a year sounds great‚Ä¶ unless you're one of the families affected by those 21 deaths.

Also, another thing‚Ä¶ a comfort you can have with regards to individual citizens being held accountable for their poor driving is that you _can_ subject individual citizens to criminal charges. I would like to point out that the United States Government has _still_ not charged the heads of companies that are responsible for _millions_ of American deaths, for example, Purdue Pharma. What guarantee do we have if Waymo messes up, Americans will be able to hold them accountable? What happens if this technology goes global? How will non-Americans hold American companies accountable if there are deaths? We can't even get the heads of an American corporation to testify, _even_ if they played a role in a _genocide_ . And now you want them to take control of _land-based vehicles_ ?",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

I mean really, if we just extrapolate that mechanism of subtle creeping unconscious influence from the hand that feeds us (likely by taking it from hungry mouths of course sadly, but that's another point) it's not really surprising how corrupt everything is and why no one trusts anything or anyone.

I mean like historically take Robert Moses for example, a vastly influential agent of regulatory capture very intentionally segregating populations through city planning to create artificial conflict and more importantly, as you're highlighting, to make the potential of public transportation (and electric cars, which we had in the late 19th century, oops) infeasible and unpractical. We're ruled by the optimates of the late Roman empire, really even worse since in actuality the underlying algorithm of capitalism we enforce through global empire maintains its flow pretty autonomously at this point, each link in the chain trained ideologically to compel themselves to replace any malfunction that doesn't serve their corporate/financial overlords, those overlords _themselves_ , were they to attempt to act with any agency that diverts from pure profit extraction at all costs, are similarly replaceable and thus ultimately individually not as powerful as we believe them to be, beholden to and (ironically, for all the talk about ""freedom"" usually presented to justify this system) enslaved by the foundational systemic incentive structure that constrains our thoughts, choices, and perception at all moments.

And thus you get this ""rational"" outcome of everyone solely acting out of their own self interest, following the insulated logic that even if they individually chose not to continue whatever role it is they play in perpetuating this system that is destroying the planet at quite literally all costs, someone else will anyway so they might as well, and over time this 'business ontology' cements itself, trust is then unsurprisingly steadily eroded and society, dare I say our very basis for consciousness if it is an emergent property of social interaction/language as it seems (contrary to the Cartesian notion the ability to ""cogito"" is inherently possible without social interaction with others), eventually destroyed. I mean my god we've dug an insane hole here and upon noticing this decided on the ""solution"" of continuing to dig even more furiously than ever...

Anyway, sorry for that inadvertently long screed there lol, only intended the thank you and appreciation for this thought amongst a sea of ""DA CAR IS SO COOL"", which it _is_ cool to be sure, but the direction we're taking technology is concerning to say the least...reminds me of an observation from that good 'ol Marx guy:

_‚ÄúOnce adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the‚Ä¶ automatic system of machinery‚Ä¶ set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages.‚Äù_ - Marx, ‚ÄúThe Fragment on Machines‚Äù in The Grundrisse",0,UgwHM4Z-NSeaZr4EUmd4AaABAg,True,none,['Waymo']

Lidar only works in good weather conditions (e.g. heavy fog or water spray from cars in front is deadly), same for cameras. And those ranges of 300m for lidar and 500m for camera sound absolutely unbelievable! Like, pick any sign on a local road, walk 500m away, take a picture and then try to read the sign in the image. You won't. Typical ranges one talks about when using cameras in autonomous driving are like 100-150m max.

Also, you see at least 4 Lidar-Sensors mounted on the car in the video. Has anyone thought about the cost? The 360¬∞ one on top is at least 30,000$, the others probably like half of that each. On top of that you have the 28(!) cameras (some of them with expensive lenses, if they are supposed to come even close to what is claimed) and several radar sensors. The latter typically cost about 1,500$ each. In sum this means that just the sensor equipment costs more than most normal cars! How is this supposed to go into a mass-produced consumer product?

Last point I want to make: energy consumption. With electric cars we are already talking about their comparably low driving range. All of these sensors and especially the GPUs/TPUs and processors needed to make use of the data need a lot, and I really mean *a lot*,  of power. This doesn't go well together at all.
(Before anyone mentions Tesla: They have never used close to this many sensors or had such a high level of automation. And there is a reason why they recently announced that they will exclusively rely on cameras in the future.)

- The number of hours of data a system is trained on is not a good measure of how safe the system is. With AI it just tells how ingrained patterns have become and how resistant to changes it now is. Overtraining an AI system is a thing as well, where it will find patterns where there are none and behave erratically. It gives mild confidence that it has seen some edge cases, but the statistic alone gives no confidence that it can handle situations a human *could* handle if they encounter it. An actual list of situations it should pass, and looking through that data if it actually encountered it would be much more useful.
- The statistics about the number of incidents do say something about safety, but only in the environment it has driven. Which, right now, seems to be two places: suburbs outside of Phoenix, Arizona, and in San Francisco and Mountain View, California.
- The point at the beginning of the video that a lot of people think self-driving cars are >10 years away, and that this is not the case because you are riding in one is poorly substantiated. The system is trained on San Francisco, and probably works fine in San Francisco, but that doesn't mean it will translate well to another city in the US, the countryside or another country entirely. This has nothing to do with ""badly maintained roads"", and more with different scenarios the system has never encountered before. The ability to identify parked cars on the road. The ability to identify when it *should* go with two wheels off-road (which you say it doesn't), because the road is too small for two vehicles to pass. The ability to identify when it cannot go with two wheels off-road and should stop at a part of the road that is a bit wider, designed to let two vehicles pass on a road that is usually too narrow for that. The ability to identify bike roads, where cars are allowed but cyclists can use the entire width of the road. Situations where road rules tell the car that it has right of way, but where human drivers commonly stop to let traffic pass for one reason or another.
- When looking at safety, replacing a random normal car with an autonomous car is not as simple as looking at ""is this car safer than the average driver"". You also have to look at scalability of the system, and what happens if you have, for example, a 100 of these cars on the same road. Right now, I would assume that these cars actively blind each other with their lidar. I would assume they can handle some data corruption due to that, but it makes the cars less reliable.
- The animation of an intersection where cars just communicate with each other instead of waiting for traffic lights is still a long way away. Such an intersection requires absolute trust between vehicles, because every vehicle on that intersection must know and trust every other vehicle on that intersection to have a plan, and execute that plan exactly as advertised. That would require 100% autonomous cars, and the only way you could trust a car 100% is if they run your software and you know its internal reasoning, or if there is some protocol in place that can handle cases like cars just not communicating. This car is not capable of doing that, and is unlikely to be able to do that in the near future.
- Moral dilemmas do not cease to be moral dilemmas if your average driver is incapable of making the decision in the first place. Waymo's vehicles predict several future scenarios. It will try it's best to get to a destination, and try it's best to avoid collisions while doing so. But it will make decisions based on the data it receives, and those decisions are made by those who tweak the vehicle time after time. And most (moral) dilemmas are not as uncommon as the ones you showcased. For example: Should the car break if a ball-like object bounces on the street, and the car is not predicted to hit it? If a trash can falls over on the street, and it predicts it cannot break to avoid hitting it, should it swerve around it? If a car hits a barrier and bounces into traffic in front of an autonomous car, should it break or swerve? What about if there is a heavy truck behind the car? What about if swerving has the potential for no other collisions to occur? What if that chance is 1%? These decisions have already been made by the people working on Waymo, either by tackling such edge cases or letting the AI network decide on it's own. You have a point that waiting for those moral dilemmas to all be solved before using autonomous vehicles is not going anywhere (we have infinite many of them), but I think you make light of these moral dilemmas. These are moral dilemmas that need to be solved, because it shouldn't be up to the programmers of the vehicle to make that call, or to come up with edge cases to test for.

That said, you make some good points. People are notoriously bad at driving and drive-assist or fully autonomous vehicles can help with that. A large quantity of autonomous vehicles can reduce congestion on highways, because they just automatically drive the same speed as each other and do not swerve left and right all the time. Autonomous vehicles are great for people that cannot or do not want to drive a car, and have to get around in places where there is no or inadequate public transport.

Thats probably the most disappointing video you have made yet. Waymo advertisement much. Wow.
Why didnt you look at the other problems with driverless cars? Why just spew the Waymo doctrine?

Couple of key problems. Over a _decade_ ago people were promising driverless cars in less than a couple of year. In fact 20 years ago Mercedes had driverless cars, but they said at the time, we need to have smart roads, not smart cars (I personally agree with this). Same with strong AI, this has _not_ come to pass and will not likely happen until we solve fundamental issues with our AI systems. The need for driverless cars is also waning because of covid and remote work. You simply dont need a driverless car if you are not traveling much - and a large portion of the world, this is what is happening. Additionally Waymo is currently desperate for funding - they are around $20B in the hole and desperately need to have some wins (I hope recent investors havent put too much in). Tesla too - still not making money on their cars. 

Couple this with the problem of needing ""nice roads"", nice weather and nice lighting for driverless to work best (hence why its in Phoenix) and other roads and areas it does not handle well (they are even marked so they go around these areas) means we are a very long way from autonomous vehicles. Sure, as a monorail.. they are great fun.. but that wears off if you need adoption. Do you remember what happens to monorails?

I ask a simple question. Why dont we reinstate trains and trams and other good high density transport? Cars are the _worst_ form of transport for our planet due to their sparse density, pollution, infrastructure waste and  the capacity to maim and hurt others. It seems insane that 100 yrs ago we had better transport systems for moving people around than we do now. 
Crazy... 

I hope you make a more balanced look at driverless car systems. Look at the last 50 yrs of dev for them, and the hyperbole in the last 10 years. They are their own worst enemy. As an ultimate concept I would love to see driveless cars implemented like in the short story, ""Ranbows End"". But the reality of this is very very unlikely.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

We literally just had a pipeline company hacked -- which shut down it's operations and caused a miniature crisis. I wonder what happens when someone develops ransomware for cars? Right now, there really aren't that many - not much of a threat vector

And skipping over a hypothetical question about the morality of the decision that a car makes is actually quite important. We're putting our lives in the hands of these algorithms.  And I don't mean the users who are in the car. I'm talking about myself, in a car next to one of these. It's kind of important that we have a public disussion about that?

What about privacy? Equity? The people who can't afford these do... what exactly? When do we make laws about these? Can thieves find a way to trigger their automatic stop system, hijack the car, rob the people, etc? 

And that's not even getting in to the technical aspects. It's not ""the world"" that has issues with road maintenance, it's literally every city in the US.  Lidar isn't all that it's cracked up to be -- Surveyor's wouldn't exist if it was as simple as what's describedi nthe video.  You can't just send a lidar out and have it identify everything. It simply doesn't work that way. 

Finally, just taking the report and saying ""well, every time waymo had a collision it was a HUMAN driver!"" is kind of nonsense. Yeah, of course it had a human driver. Dogs and cat's aren't driving cars.

By the time these automated driving tech start to become mainstream, I wonder if it'll be the car manufacturers who will install it in their cars from factory, or if it'll be installed by a third party (like Waymo). And whether or not all the self-driving cars on the road will be based on one standardized autonomy system or if there will be different competing autonomy systems.

Will the rise of the self driving vehicle mean the death of high-performance cars? After all, they're a small niche of cars made to be quick, to be swift and be tremendous fun to drive. We see nowadays that sedans are now less popular because people favor crossovers and SUVs. If all cars on the road are fully autonomous, then won't it be useless to make a fast car because it'll just end up driving at the same speeds as everyone else anyways?

We should be thinking about how to transition to a society away from cars. Cars are terrible, driverless or not. They created a blighted urban sprawl landscape of strip malls and highways.

Don't get me wrong, it's great that this company has managed to do so much with the service so far, but it not a solution to traffic and it is not a solution to moving people from place to place efficiently. Certainly they've managed to accumalate more data than I thought they would and I have no doubt that it'll grow exponentially as they add more cars to their fleet and therefore the system will become better.

A big problem I see is that this tech seems to be proprietry, or at least I've not heard of any open source version of full self driving. Which is why Tesla has had to develop their own version which unlike Waymo's has actually seriously hurt people. The database needs to be open source to allow all self-driving car companies to have the level of safety that Waymo has, and in return they contribute to the database making it even larger and therefore even better and safer than Waymo can achieve on their own.

Still though, I prefer my automated metro systems, faster, safer, and just one hell of a lot better for people overall.

It seems waymo has only been tested in ideal driving areas like California and Phoenix Arizona.

Derek tries to convince us that the ""average"" human driver is a bad driver, and talks about how humans drive off the road, hit stationary objects, etc. That might all be true, but my suspicion is that a large percentage of these are due to drivers that drive while under the influence, text and drive, drive while sleepy, etc. These skew the distribution of human driver safety to the right. Derek mentions most people think they are above average drivers. I think he is assuming the safety of human drivers follows a bell curve. But if the distribution skews to the right, as I predict it does, then you can have a the mean far below the median, and most people can in fact be better than the mean. If you are a human driver that follows the baseline responsibility guidelines, I'm sure you're above the mean.

The most impressive, in my mind, was involving a driver who was hot boxing in their car. It was on a two lane road, I drove up behind the hotboxer and could immediately spot the situation. He was driving slower than traffic and slightly erratic albeit within his lane. The Waymo van pulled up next to me and slowed down refusing to pass the hotboxer, opting to drive below the speed limit until the car turned, at which point the Waymo sped back up to speed and continued on. I spent a long time thinking about what variables in the code must have led it to make that determination. It would seem that if a car is driving below the speed limit and/or exceeding some level of movement within their lane, the algorithm will not pass the car. It could obviously not see that the cabin was full of smoke, so it could only make that decision based on what I would deem to be fairly subtle differences between how a normal driver would drive and how a potential hazard would drive.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

We're just not made to do that. Relying on a human to be attentive at all times while not giving them any actual tasks to perform was never a good move, and I'm glad to see Waymo accepts this basic reality and has eliminated that position.

Curious question: Why does a self-driving car in Arizona have California license plates? Are they being built and registered in California, and then shipped (or driven) to PHX for their shakedown testing? If there's a possibility a car may be sent back to California, I can see the logic in keeping the plates as is until they're sure, since it's not possible to register an out-of-state car in California until it has 7500 miles on the odometer. In my experience, insurance carriers are also willing to look the other way when people don't immediately transfer their registration as they're supposed to when they move to CA, because they are often in a bind where one law says they have to transfer within 30 days, and another that says they can't until they have 7500 miles.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

What worries me with this video is that it kinda makes all driverless cars the same and at the same time we have other companies that want to have as few sensors as possible. I agree that this particular car seems to be safe but I do worry about other ones. I don't want people in cars of lower level automation seeing this video and think they can pay less attention.

The comparison with planes and elevators I find is a bit disingenuous since they have feedback with higher signal to noise ratio than doing a much more involve sensor fusion as the Waymo cars does. I do appreciate that you as a content creator have to take on sponsored videos but you also have a reputation of going to the bottom of things. I did not get that impression here. I do like that you disclose in the beginning that you are sponsored but it is easy to forget that in an 18 minute video and then fall back on your reputation.

Another disingenuous argument is that humans make mistakes, machines doesn't. Machines are made by humans and programmed by humans. Mistakes can still happen. In fact, in a fully deployed automatic system, a systemic mistake may have far greater consequences than individual humans making their own individual mistakes.

It would be comparatively easy to do fully autonomous cars if we didn't have to worry about human driven cars,  pedestrians, animals or debris. I do think that we will have safe fully autonomous cars at some point but I do think it is important to progress slowly and have high demands on the companies providing these vehicles. I don't think it is a good solution to get rid of human drivers completely because I do think it is a valuable freedom to have, to be able to get around by our own accord. If we remove human driven cars, maybe then we also get rid of bicyclists and suddenly we live in some sort of maze where you can't get around unless you take great risks crossing roads were nobody is expected to cross or have funds and permissions to use the only option left to us.

If this had not been a sponsored video it would have been interesting if you had done some experiments. Flash blue lights at the car. Play a loud siren sound. Fake some roadsigns.

I think you did a good job on the video, it was well produced and you kept it interesting. But I don't like how it felt just like an opinion piece to hurry legislation in favor of Waymo rather than a more objective take on it.",3,,True,none,['Waymo']

So the problem here is the high number of fatality that exists in manual driving of personal vehicles. And one of the solutions is autonomous vehicles yes, but there are more right for example city planning can implement better public transportation in the city which leads to walkable cities. 
The fact that this video is sponsored by Waymo itself, feels like this is a 18 mins of painting a good picture for autonomous cars(I totally agree with what you have said of machines being better drivers than humans and the loss of human life is totally sad.) 
I totally love your content and I can imagine that this might not be your intent. (that you just want to ask the question about autonomous cars being comfortable) I just didn't see one negative comment on the whole topic in the video and there wasn't a specific portion which was sponsred, so I feel the way I do.

Sure, we all chuckle at that - but how useful is self-reporting when a significant percentage of people have lots of Dunning-Kruger Effect, little objectivity and are generally wrong? Suppose you gave people a test of some sort, then asked them some self-reporting questions. Could you factor out whose likely to be wrong about their self-reporting?  Factoids like this wind up only being useful as jokes. 
And ""Human error is the cause of 94% of accidents."" What does that even mean? 
There's a road north of Cabo San Lucas to Todos Santos that if it was in the United States there would be just as many fatal accidents on it. (No shoulder, huge drop offs, go off that road and you'll likely die - there are shrines to the dead everywhere, on most roads in the U.S. you veer off the paved road you'll hear gravel, mutter uh-oh and not even remember it happening.)  'Went off the road, turned over...' as a cause of death is I am sure listed as 'Human Error.' Is it the error or the road that killed the people in those vehicles on the Todos Santo road? 
And Waymo.  ""If you have a vehicle with lidar and radar and 29 cameras, you're not going to hit them"" ...or go anywhere outside of a small part of Phoenix, Arizona, and  the vehicles will be compact cars that cost more than $400,000.  And require a room full of techs watching on computers. Yeah, those Waymo cars sure are amazing.  I've rented cars in Scotland and Japan and driven on roads I'd never seen before (I love traffic roundabouts) and did just fine. I even missed hitting the first fox, also the second, to ever dart in front of a car I'm driving.  I made some bonehead mistakes but as I wasn't on the road to Todos Santos I survived.  I also know that the Tesla Model Y I've been driving for the past 9 months can just about do as well. One thing it does exceptionally well is stay on the road in the lane. So Todos Santos? Not a problem. (For Waymo Flagstaff, Tucson and all of Mexico may as well be on Mars.) 
And if my Tesla gets in an accident (all the serious traffic accidents I've been in were not in anyway my fault - or avoidable by me ) then Tesla's safety features will keep me from dying - even if it goes off the edge of that road to Todos Santos. (A model S went off a cliff a couple of weeks ago, everyone survived.) 
This is a meta analysis video which is a polite way of saying it's a not very deep commercial for Waymo.  A lot of information distilled by some other party,  so it's like averaging averages.  (The Trolley Problem - really? what are we 15?)  and then some cheery statements. I'm almost certain I'll win this discussion when Tesla FSD becomes either the universally used system of self-driving or is the basis of it. Waymo ... might be useful in limited situations, perhaps in limited 'geo-fenced' areas where zero errors can be tolerated, moving nuclear waste, transferring explosives at a mining site, luggage trains on airport tarmacs.  
The mark of a BS report on the state of autonomous driving in the 2020s? They don't include Tesla, unless it's some snarky bit about a few misbehaving Tesla drivers.  The New York Time in the past two months ran two of them. In one they quoted a source saying autonomous driving isn't likely to happen in 30 years. Why don't they include flat earthers in stories about space?  Waymo is interesting but this is an embarrassing fluff piece.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Obviously we shouldn't rush things inappropriately, we should make sure each system is significantly better than the average human (with data to prove it) before allowing wide launch, but to wait for perfection is tantamount to murder.

I'm not sure who will get self driving solved first, but I'm glad that there are multiple groups of skilled and dedicated people working on it. I don't know if Waymo's approach of high definition maps with lidar and a team that looks like it has more people than cars will win out, or if Tesla's larger fleet, collecting data from the wild, and using primarily vision (I think they still have ultrasonic sensors, but they've dropped radar and never had lidar) will get there faster.

People already pay less attention than we should when driving. The question is whether the probability of a near full self driving car crashing while the pilot isn't paying attention is greater or less than the probability of a non-self driving car crashing while the driver isn't paying attention. Depending on how reliable the self driving system on the car is, the degree to which the pilot has to not pay attention to exceed the non self driving baseline varies greatly. For example, if you just have lane keeping assistance, taking your eyes off the road for even a few seconds is extremely dangerous, if you have Tesla fsd beta (v9 is most up to date right now I think), you are pretty unlikely to have an accident in a few seconds of inattention, even though you should keep paying attention throughout. We don't have good external data on any of these fsd systems (at least none that I've been able to find), but I suspect that people trust it less than they trust themselves when driving, and as a result even partially self driving systems are safer, with the twist that people who have more experience and therefore more trust in the system they use are less attentive and slightly more likely to be in an accident than new users, but still overall less likely to be in a collision than an unassisted driver. I'd really like to see better data on this.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

""Weather conditions like rain, sleet and snow reduce the effectiveness of on-board sensors. In fact, some weather conditions may completely blind a sensor, making it useless. If falling snow gathers on the front of a LiDAR unit, then it can no longer return 3D data for the vehicle‚Äôs perception engine.""

This is why the service currently only operates is Phoenix where it's almost always sunny. It's skewed data, based solely on it being sunny all day every day. There's also the possibility to fine tune map data for navigation on a smaller scale compared to real world data. Anyone who has ever used a GPS in their life has had times where it redirects them the wrong way, tells them to get into the wrong lane, or worse still drives the wrong way down a one way street.

There is a huge gap between a plane autopilot and a self-driving car. People tend to think about how planes are complex and ""deduce"" from that that everything about a plane is complex. That just isn't true.

In the operation of a plane, nearly everything of relevance can be measured in nearly-direct ways. Things like pitot tubes, radar, and ILS are all simple enough for an individual or small team to understand thoroughly. They can reliably judge whether the design of the system meets at least a basic standard of soundness. 

The relationship between those measurements and the correct responses can also be readily understood. Much of it is planned by the airlines before they integrate a given model of plane.

These factors come together to mean that a plane autopilot can be thoroughly analyzed by the design team for correctness.

However, active monitoring is still required by the pilots. They need to be able to take control at a moment's notice. This is exactly the standard which Waymo believes a normal person can't be held to.

In a self-driving car, both the measurements of the world (not just ""how fast am I going"" but also ""is that a stop sign?"" and such) and the decision-making are much more complicated endeavors that people can't thoroughly design. It is effectively required for machine learning to be used. There are many organizations which know how to create machine learning models, but none that can dig into the model and prove its correctness. It's become a bit of a trend to show how errors in the model can be triggered -- look up ""adversarial patch"". The only tools for evaluation available for a machine learning model are statistical in nature. How many of the stops signs and non-stop-signs shown to it are correctly identified? No-one is able to confidently say that the data set used to evaluate the model covers every edge-case. Statistical evaluation is an important part of evaluation, but it can't be considered sufficient.

So ultimately, self-driving cars are waiting for machine learning technology to be well-understood. Right now, the technology is widely and somewhat blindly used.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

They are amazing and do well however at one point following them on a freeway they seem to modulate their brakes often.   This makes it unpredictable for human's driving around it to anticipate what it is going to do and after awhile you start to tune out the modulated brake lights which then makes you less efficient at reacting if there is a sudden stop.

All a plane has to ""think"" about is flying a direction and an altitude (perhaps following a signal from something like a VOR beacon or ILS approach), that's it. That cat III ILS approach was impressive sure but when it comes down to it all the plane was doing was following a signal to the runway and using ground radar to  determine when to flare (which is admittedly a simplification but you get the gist). 

Also all other traffic announces itself through things like ads-b (the exception being small GA planes and even then they are often equipped) so collision avoidance can (and largely is) automated too, cars do not have that luxury (yet?).

Meanwhile a car has many, many more parameters to take into account which are way more unpredictable too even though they move through 1 less dimension: other drivers (in all types of vehicles from bikes to trucks), pedestrians, animals, traffic signals, road signs, emergency vehicles, the weather obscuring vision,.... the list goes on.


So while under good weather and road conditions and with no unexpected situations his technology currently works it is the millions (if not billions) of edge cases that still throw the technology for a loop. Just look up the videos of a waymo car that runs into a construction zone and froze in the middle of a lane in the middle of traffic, or how it got stuck for 10 minutes trying to navigate a very busy parking lot.
Waymo cars will even take routes that are way longer to avoid certain intersections or to minimize left turns turning a 10 minute ride into one that takes double that.

So yes, level 4 is here and works with the caveat that the weather be nice and no unexpected things happen so IMO it'll be a couple years yet (at least) before true level 5 will be achieved.
But as always, technology often develops exponentially with periods of stagnation followed by leaps forward as breakthroughs are discovered so who knows, I could be completely wrong.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

I am not inherently against self driving cars, even in the near future. I fully believe they are saver than humans driving. The problem I have is that they are a partial solution to a problem that is way bigger: North America‚Äôs sub urban sprawl and car dependency. 

As a European I maybe drive once a month for longer trips or to transport something big, and when I do I actually enjoy the act of driving because we hardly get any traffic jams. The rest of the time it is actually much more convenient and faster to walk, bike or take public transport for my daily commutes.

I would urge Americans to start fixing their infrastructure, public transport and don‚Äôt spend to much time and recourses in these kind of bandaids. Most American cities are in incredible debt, because post war suburbs are basically a ponzy scheme. You can not tax your residents enough to maintain all those roads, high ways and parking spaces if everybody needs a car for everything they do. So they just keep on building and going into deeper dept.

Why did I run into it? Primary reason: simply not paying attention. It didn't happen 800+ other times. Secondary reason: car was stationary somewhere it shouldn't be stationary for more than ~2-3 seconds which is what I suspect happened with the waymo cars.

A lot of the video was dedicated toward human attitudes and behaviour regarding self driving cars, while very little was focussed on technology readiness. Eg. how will the cars handle it if EVERY car is fitted with LIDAR? Surrounded by 100 cars each with multiple LIDARs will it still function or be rendered useless, perhaps something in between with phantom detections?

There was so much nuance that was either brushed over or ignored, attributing poor performance to such throwaway comments as, ""in some parts of the world the roads aren't well enough maintained."" Meanwhile you're driving round in perfect conditions on very wide American style roads, many of which are dual carriageways. Try that Waymo car on a narrow country road in the UK and see how it does, my bet is that it would cross the lane divider frequently just as Tesla's do too. Self driving cars that are trained on very wide american roads are actually dangerous and not fit for purpose on narrower UK and European roads. They also seem to be averse at making strong control inputs, which means that tight turns and corners are an issue for them, but again not a problem on wide roads with sweeping turns, and all intersections meet at 90 degrees.

I'm not a luddite, and I of course accept that in certain conditions and on certain types of road (essentially dual carriageways and motorways), they are undoubtedly better drivers and never suffer lapses in concentration. However I have not seen anything to suggest that any self driving tech has even come close to driving safely on smaller and more congested roads.

With regards to your poll at 1:20 these options are not mutually exclusive, I am both excited to see a future where they exist and function well, but at the same time I still think it will be >10 years before full unmonitored self-driving is ready.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Blackmail malware has been increasing in recent years, and blackmail over control of your car sounds terrifying.

However, I'm not sure FOSS (free open source software) is a prerequisite for safety. As far as I know, the existing airplane autonomous piloting or elevator systems are not FOSS, but they are generally assumed to be safe regardless. And why ""as in freedom""? GNU's definition of free-as-in-freedom mandates the freedom to modify the software. Once these systems are widely adopted, I think having Waymo car running some homebrew homemade software would increase risk. If the homebrew system glitches, drivers around the homebrew car can't tell that it's a custom system to respond accordingly. We absolutely need to audit each autonomous car system and test them to make sure they're safe before mass adoption but after that ""free as in freedom"" seems like increased risk to me.",0,UgxiAaxRsKt9Fj2C9Ox4AaABAg,True,none,['Waymo']

(Presumably they've fixed the driving into the side of the bus thing, I'll assume that for the moment.). But the problem isn't making it work 99% of the time.  It's the 1%...the long tail.

- a sudden downpour in which visibility drops to nearly nil in seconds (what do you do if moving?)
- a construction zone where the old lines have been blacked out, and new ones placed, but at an angle, reflection off both old and new make them look similar, and suddenly it's not clear where the lines are
- a flash flood (happened a few miles down the highway from where I'm sitting)
- whiteout from blowing snow
- 1000 other such things

Judgment, and the ability to improvise, rather than 1000 years of driving history, is a major way to deal with these.

I got enthusiastic about self drive when DARPA stopped holding self drive challenges because the technology was too good...no longer an advanced research topic, in their view, apparently.  And when Google (pre Waymo) published a video of their vehicle sitting things that humans didn't.

But then less so when events showed this to be premature hype, like the car driving into the side of the bus, or a number of seemingly inexcusable Tesla accidents (like not distinguishing that a stopped fire truck wasn't an overhead road sign...say what?  You're at what level of driving?) or driving into the side of a tractor trailer when sunlight blinded.

It'll take more than a drive on a nice day on multi lane roads to convince me.  Show me it driving in a sudden squall, with children piling out of a school, poor lighting, driven rain making the lidar picture more complicated, shopping bags blowing down the street, and maybe a homework assignment amongst those.

I think it makes sense on interstates, like what chevy has for their super cruise- interstates are long, gently curving roads with no cross traffic and generally physical barriers of some kind separating oncoming traffic. But on city streets? Absolutely not, and anybody trying to tell you they're better than human drivers is selling you something, or at the very least, really do not know enough about the tech and are buying the marketing hype. At the very least, if a self driving car is on the road, I would expect it to prioritize the rider's life last over everybody else- if somebody steps out onto the road, that thing better drive itself into a wall rather than run somebody down, or else every single engineer at Waymo should be tried for murder. That's the risk you should accept when you get into one of these things.

""the only safe way to proceed is with a car with at least level 4 autonomy"" and who exactly decides that? waymo? do you really trust silicon valley to keep pedestrians safe?

Not that human drivers are, uh, particularly good, but the technology is *absolutely not there* to replace humans yet. Nowhere NEAR. Autonomous cars also won't solve traffic or help the environment or generally make cities nicer, safer places to live- what we need is to just build some dang trains and bike lanes.

anyways. just generally sucks to see you making some obvious propaganda for wildly unsafe and socially terrible experimental technology which will absolutely result in even more unnecessary deaths on the road. All you would be doing by switching to autonomous car is laundering the human error so that nobody has liability when a Waymo car plows directly into a toddler or drives you directly into a wall because it was painted just the wrong color or something. I just think this is a tremendously irresponsible video, presenting a lot of- at best- terminally car-brained futurism, or at worst, just repeating marketing points that Waymo fed you.

(1) black ice/snow. Although I'm sure a car can receive more weather updates, recognizing and evaluating the road in blizzard/icy conditions isn't as simple as visually looking. An autonomous vehicle in flat, dry, hot Phoenix is going to outperform an autonomous vehicle in Alberta, Boise, or Anchorage. So Phoenix really is a BEST case for autonomy. It's important to understand the WORST cases for autonomous vehicles. Phoenix is also famous for sprawl - the narrow streets and high population density of Seattle, San Fran, Boston or NYC are other ""worst cases.""  
(2) Old autonomous vehicles. All technologies slow down eventually. The components in the autonomous vehicles will be overused and subject to weather while driving more than most consumer electronics. What happens when a car begins to slow down it's analysis? Does Waymo discontinue use of that vehicle? Because that is probably a very inefficient life-cycle for a vehicle. Constantly getting new vehicles is one of the most environmentally unsustainable practices, and I'm worried that in an abundance of caution for safety the vehicles will be discarded for newer models.

UNLESS you need to haul a fair amount of stuff. And Driverless cars are way to expensive for the most people thus there won't be a majority of them thus significantly reducing their effectivity.

In my opinion - The technology was here for many years. But Driverless cars are way too expensive for most people to own. Solution: You will not ""own"" them and they will be driving people around for money (most people myself included wouldn't like that). Or maybe companies like UBER and Waymo can use them, Well ... but then it becomes a public transport and you can do that with well working and optimized metro/tram/buss and for way less money, at least in a city. So long rides? Again. If we are talking about people with hand luggage only, a well working and optimized train route is far superior pretty much in every regard except time and privacy but that can be solved too. 

So only people that can afford the cars will use them and most people will still use the old cars. Then there is the bad thing that unless 100% of the cars are driverless. All it takes is a 1 car slowing down on highway, and now you have a traffic jam for some time. 

Also as I've been in many situations where there is an accident on a highway, and you need to follow a officer that is showing you if you can or can't go. How is the car going to interpret that? Will it see an empty road and go right ahead possibly running over someone? Or will it be stuck because it sees a person standing on the road thus possibly blocking the whole road for the 10-50Km of traffic? Yes it a pretty niche scenario but again. it only has to happen once for it to be a huge setback (possibly blocking the road for hours). What if someone without driver licence is behind the wheel and can't drive it around. Or better yet. What if there is a blind person or no-one at all.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

The real hard corner cases for driving are the ones you cannot predict even with random simulations. You can simulate cars and pedestrians all year, then send out the car and it meets a cow on the road. The other issue is that 90% of self driving is accurate object recognition ie identifying what objects are in the world, what types of objects they are and where they are. Choosing a path once you know where those objects are is actually the easy part. If the car sees something on the road ahead it needs to know is it OK to hit it or not. That requires being able to distinguish a plastic back from a rock, etc. Simulations won't help you here. Only better image recognition trained on a vast set of possible objects and then classifying them into 'its OK/not OK to hit'. Outside the limited areas Waymo drives the hardest part for self driving is dealing with poorly marked roads. It takes a really significant amount of AI training to understand the correct path to take on roads with incorrect/absent marking and/or confusing borders. Waymo is great for limited areas and I can't wait for them to come to an area near me, but they are a long way from handling the sort of driving I do regularly (farm roads)",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

In the US over 3 Trillion miles are driven each year. Approximately 6 million car accidents (of any kind, most are harmless and won‚Äôt even cause significant property damage) happen in that same time frame. So per million miles driven there are approximately 2 accidents.

Waymo with their 20 million miles driven and only 18 accidents, is just below 1 accident per million miles. Or about twice as safe as a human driver. This is also before you account for the fact that the US average includes things like truck drivers driving hundreds of miles a day on the same lonely back highways of the Western US where you barely encounter any cars and thus are incredibly unlikely to crash lowering the collision average significantly compared to urban and suburban areas where Waymo does most of their driving.

So in terms of capabilities I would definitely say we‚Äôre here in terms of self-driving.

Also as a note: Telsa‚Äôs seld-driving options are at most a 2-3 (for regulation purposes they are a 2) on the self-driving scale provided, essentially they are currently more akin to early Waymo examples of people being responsible for the driving and needing to assist the car from time to time, but leaving too much up to the car and getting distracted.

Like comparing traffic to elevators. Isn't it obvious how incredibly more complex car traffic is?
Airplanes have auto-pilot, yes, but have you ever been in a plane without pilot? There are even two pilots in a plane! And I will argue that the scenario of flying a plane is a lot easier to solve for a machine than handling traffic. Auto-pilots in planes do not even use machine learning algorithms to predict any future event. Machine learning and specifically Deep Learning which is used in most of autonomous driving systems, produces models which are inherently unpredictable. It might sometimes be hard to predict the behaviour of other human drivers but at least you can expect some basic human-like decisions, not with AI.
Why do you assume driverless cars are safer than human controlled? There is definitely not enough data to make such a statement. I don't even say that it's not the case, but there is certainly no proof for this anywhere in Waymo's publications (They even state that it is very hard to produce reliable statistics to back such a statement).
You say it is unethical to not replace all cars by autonomous vehicles because lives could be saved? According to the same logic it would be unethical to remove the driver from the autonomous vehicle, because you know what is even safer than a driverless vehicle? A driverless vehicle with a driver as 'backup system'. This is the only form in which autonomous driving should be allowed in my opinion.

That's...so telling about human stupidity. But at that point blaming the waymo would be like blaming a house for a drunk driver crashing into it lol. They really have made some strides in safety though, i live where these run and worked with some former drivers who gave some of the dirt. The accidents involving waymos were almost always either due to the other driver hitting it (like running a red, or just plowing into it because they weren't watching traffic) or because the waymo driver (they still had a backup driver for a long time) screwing up. Like the former driver said they had an incident where the waymo driver fell asleep and turned the wheel, deactivating the automation, and rolled the van (thankfully no passenger or other vehicles were involved). There was an incident where one disgruntled former employee tried to cause wrecks, pulling in front of the waymos and slamming his brakes, and eventually got one to hit him. But police investigated, found the video footage of the dozen+ other times he tried it and failed, and he ended up in jail for it. They really are surprisingly good now, worst case that's happened lately was a funny one where a youtuber who documents all his waymo rides had the car get stuck due to bad construction (they put the cones way too far apart, so the vehicle got confused as to whether the lane was open or closed), and then the support team back at headquarters screwed up in their instructions they pushed to the vehicle which made it worse. So even in that case, it still involved humans making decisions and screwing up. 
So the future of these cars involves a lot, such as proper maintenance of roads, and more uniform rules for construction companies doing road work because we have all seen some really crappy companies that can't put their barricades in place right, or leave lanes too small for most traffic, etc.",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

The bigger issue is their reliance on hd maps which is not scalable.  Their reliance on hd maps also means that they are not very flexible ( say a spot which previously was empty now has construction ). A huge problem in Machine Learning is the long tail of rare events and you simply cant get those edge cases and train the model for it unless and until you have a huge fleet of cars in diverse conditions sending you feedback.

There are countless examples waymo cars stuck and disabled in the middle of streets and blocking traffic. Autonomous cars must be successful 100% of the time, otherwise, any failure is an accident or blocking traffic. Also, the argument that Autonomous cars will be safer because they will have less fatalities compared to humans might be true only if all cars on the road are Autonomous. Until then, fatalities might as well increase because both occupy the same road and operating on different instincts!  Finally, the real motive to develop this technology for such companies is never about safety, movement for people with disability ...etc. I believe it is actually to minimize future expenses of hiring workers, which mean we are solving a problem that's not really a problem and will create a future problem !",0,,True,none,['Waymo']

The main problems I've seen in the field are older car companies not understanding how to develop software in general and newer companies that overestimate the results that their NN-based solutions get. In both cases you end up with an autopilot that would occasionally catastrophically fail. Waymo knows how to develop software and the hardware they use is complete overkill so it is very expensive but at least guarantees a minimum level of safety. And a lot of it comes down to using the ridiculously expensive but also very reliable LIDAR. Tesla's solution is entirely based on NNs processing camera images which doesn't give you this baseline safety and you can see it in their accidents. The autopilot often fails in trivial situations due to the limitations of NNs. Their whole concept is based on doing what the human brain does but they've skipped the step where the human brain uses simple and hard-wired algorithms to generate 3D data from the two ""cameras"" we have. A fully autonomous car can be made entirely using cameras but not without simpler and more predictable perception algorithms compared to what Tesla are doing. You don't necessarily need LIDAR, though cheaper LIDAR would be warmly welcomed. And you have to keep in mind that a solution that would lead to most cars on the road being autonomous would mean that the autopilot shouldn't add too much cost to the total cost of the vehicle. And I would say $2000 is a good approximation of this limit. A LIDAR or NN heavy solution cannot get even close to this limit.

(1 million cars x 60 miles per day, average).  Those ""simulated"" miles are extremely dubious.  Who verifies that what the simulation does is realistic?  Consider a deer crossing the road ahead of you, at night.  How many deer interactions are there in 20 million miles of real world data?   I'd guess maybe a few hundred - but deer interactions are complicated.  How the deer reacts depends not just on it's own desires - but also on the time of day, time of year, the weather, whether there are other cars coming from a different direction, your speed, whether there are baby deer with it's momma, whether it's the rutting season...stuff we can't even imagine.   You simply cannot capture enough deer encounters with 20 million miles of real world data to safely infer what a deer might do - and what your best course of action is.  So you're left with simulation trying to fill in these gaps.   But the behavior of deer is not something that WayMo's simulation engineers know....they just don't.   Sure, you could get a deer biologist ""expert"" to come in and work on that part - but do THEY even know?   I think not.   But Tesla now have somewhere around 70 BILLION miles of real-world data.  And that's going to include a thousand times more deer encounters than WayMo's dataset.  (Actually, a hell of a lot more than that because WayMo's cars only drive in city centers).   This is the fundamental flaw in WayMo's approach.  Sure, they can capture enough in-town data to build a reasonably safe car - and with only a few hundred cars on the roads, the odds of them encountering something they never saw before is small.  But when you have a few million cars driving on country roads, freeways, in tunnels, in different countries where the rules and driving customs are different - they simply CANNOT capture enough data to do the job.   So, yeah - a WayMo taxi can drive you around some small downtown area - but ask it to drive you from El Paso, Texas to Sheboygan Wisconsin  (as my Tesla recently drove me) - it's going to see VASTLY  more things than they have data for...and they can't fix that.  They'd need a million cars on the road (which WayMo can't afford) - each one covered in their sensors (which are EXPENSIVE - so they won't pursuade large car makers to install them unnecessarily for a few years before the software will work).   This is a serious problem - and I don't see how anyone other than a large car maker with the motivation to spend the money on it can possibly make this work...outside of some tiny, heavily constrained area.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"
