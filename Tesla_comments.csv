In any weather (good or bad) the computer or the pilot are using instruments to provide positional information that you cannot get from simply looking out the window.  And though the ""computer"" is flying the pilots still ""tweak"" settings to fine tune how well the computer flies in real time.  Also, there are massive systems on the ground to provide the situational precision required to work.  The planes cannot just automatically land on any long strip of ground.  There is as much work going on on the ground to get the plan to land correctly as there is happening in the plane.  The planes line up with the landing systems on the ground and together the whole thing works. But planes don't have dozens of other planes just a few feet away from them moving is different direction, stopping and starting, swerving, failing to stop when they should... you get the pictures.  Planes operate in an extremely controlled environment with humans keeping them separated typically by miles not feet.  Cars operate in a much more complex environment with many more possibilities.  I have a Tesla with FSD and it's amazing.  These systems will get there but it will probably take all cars talking to each other and working together to do this nearly as safely as planes do it.  The biggest difference, I believe, is humans can anticipate... they can intuit what other drivers are about to do and prepare a response before something happens.  Not perfectly or all the time of course and drivers that aren't paying attention or are impaired can't do that... but computer can only really react.  They can react very quickly, faster than a human, but they don't anticipate like humans and so you get strange (non-human) reactions. Like slamming on the brakes in a strange way.  Right now the number of cars on the road attempting to drive themselves is so tiny and other human drivers can react to the strange times they make very weird mistakes that it's not leading to major problems... yet.  Also driving around Phoenix is not nearly as challenging as driving around let's say, Los Angeles or Manhattan.  It's the edge cases where these systems are 10+ years away from reality.  On wide, well marked streets in suburban Phoenix these systems do okay but there is a long way to go before you should really want driverless cars on the road.",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

I cringe a lot when watching Tesla FSD beta videos, re its wild inconsistency re such safety issues thus far.

Even better, we humans should not even be allowed to drive cars, we are dangerous.

As for Waymo, no, it is not fully autonomous it can't even be considered level 4, it can't think for itself, and it certainly can't predict what others may do. 
Also, it only works on geofenced pre-maped locations that act as ""invisible rails"" because the car can't understand what is happening around it, it will need machine learning A.I. to do that, while Waymo uses mostly human-writen code.
I could put a few cameras on a car and hard-code it to work around my neighborhood without a driver, this would not make it a fully autonomous car (meaning level 5). This is exactly what Waymo does but on a larger scale because of budget.

Waymo is 6-8 years behind Tesla and will probably never have anything better than lvl 3 that will work out of the specified locations as long as they keep using Lidar and not a vision-only/focused approach with machine learning and a huge amount of data (which they lack) to train it. 

Tesla will have level 5 by the end of 2023 and it will work everywhere, while Waymo will continue to only work on few pre-maped locations. The most important reason for this colossal lead is their approach (vision-based vs lidar), and the second reason is the amount and quality of the data. 
Waymo's number and quality are a joke, Tesla has more than 3.5 BILLION miles (at least 100 times of what Waymo has) on its A.I. and they also have more ""real-world"" conditions because they are not in few specified locations that are easy to drive around.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

A lot of her time is wasted going to the start point of public transport, switching public transport and from end point to final destination. However, this technology is only viable if it's truly autonomous 100% of the time. That means not only must it be able to navigate all kinds of obstacles like roadworks and accidents, but also all kinds of weather. (Rain still seems to be a problem for Waymo sensory systems.) A lot of road infrastructure has to be either changed or augmented to accommodate these vehicles. For example traffic regulatory systems (traffic lights, speed signs, etc) need some way of communicating with the vehicle as well as communication between vehicles. Also for better or worse a lot of legislation has to be done. (It took literally centuries to come up with road rules.) And we as a society have to accept that small and major accidents will happen. I also imagine that ""car ownership"" is going to be an issue. It looks that Tesla bets that cars will be still owned by the majority of individuals, while the rest (Alphabet, Ford, etc) assumes that a ""car as a service"" is the more likely outcome. I can imagine that we might not even have individual cars in the future, but something that is a hybrid between car, bus and train.

There is a massive difference between partial and full autonomous.

(I‚Äôm not entirely sure if they really are, but that seems to be what most pilots think.)

Of course planes can auto land in bad visibility because the airport is fully equipped with special radio-wave landing assistance systems that help tell the plane whether it‚Äôs on the right path, without the plane needing to use any of its own sensors to otherwise detect the runway and without needing any optical measurements. Also, runways are always straight and flat and it is always a pretty good assumption that they are clear of any obstacles. 

No roads are so equipped to help tell a car where it is, nor are they straight, flat, or clear of obstacles. So cars have to rely entirely on their own optical and other sensors to determine their position, where the road is going, the state of traffic signals or other signage, and where various unpredictably moving obstacles are (or will soon be going). It does not seem obvious that they would NECESSARILY be much better than a human at this in bad weather/visibility, especially when eschewing the use of non-optical sensors, as in the case of Tesla. Having non-optical distance sensors that can cut through fog, or see as well in the dark as they do in daylight, or monitor 360 degrees simultaneously, are a big advantage though.

Still an awesome video and I loved seeing everything in it though.

I wrote a paper in July 2018 titled, ""What is society's understanding of the impact/benefits of autonomous vehicles?""
In 2020 there was 1.37 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled by humans. That translates to about 100 people per day, or 36,000+ people per year.
When I wrote the paper in 2018, there had been a total of 4 fatalities with autonomous vehicles in the USA (3 by Tesla and 1 by Uber) with over 5 billion autonomous miles driven. That makes 0.08 fatalities per 100,000,000 miles driven.

*Deaths per 100,000,000 miles driven:*
Humans: 1.37 (36,000+ deaths a year)
Autonomous driving: 0.08 (4 deaths total)

Do you trust them around your autonomous vehicle? And then we have companies like Tesla who are out-right lying about their autonomous driving modes ... it becomes a huge mess of ethics and business priorities. Who is liable if your autonomous vehicle kills someone? What if it gets hacked? What if auto vehicles get a virus which causes them to do stupid things on the road? The vehicles become a HUGE black box where most normal people (users or owners) wouldn't even know how to fix them and or take care of them. So, naturally, you have to totally eliminate vehicle ownership ... you must then rely on companies like Waymo to transport all humans ... and now you've restricted your freedom of travel to the routes they have programmed.... you see where this is going? Unfortunately, for autonomous vehicles to truly work well, human vehicle ownership needs to go, therefore putting all your freedom of movement in the hands of a.i. and companies making such a.i. ... this isn't a good thing, humans are already losing crucial life-sustaining skills with every new generation, how many people do you know can hunt or farm their own food today? Exactly ... So now, with auto-driving we are further reducing the general human ability by taking away common motor-skills from people... I just don't feel like this will lead to a better future. Motor-skills, situational awareness, decision making under pressure and so on are important human skills to have and maintain - even if they lead to some accidents in the process, you will NEVER be 100% safe. IMHO, your airplane comparison is really invalid, planes aren't really worried about ""traffic"" or pedestrians, AND, pilots go through INSANE (and very expensive) training and licensing before they can engage the ""auto pilot"" button on a 747. Unfortunately, the roads aren't as empty as the skies...  Finally, if COVID taught us anything, it is that the government is in absolute control over our travels and whereabouts, should we REALLY give them even more power, i.e. the ability to disable all autonomous cars with a click of a button when they don't want us to move around like they grounded all airplanes and stopped travel between nations with the stroke of a pen? I STILL can't see my family because of international travel restrictions, it has been 17+ months and here I am at the mercy of some douche bag in office to see my loved ones ... I personally don't think this is a good idea - it's not a future I want. Your freedoms trump my safety, and we as humans shouldn't be looking for more reasons to be lazy and incompetent (such as sleeping in our cars while they drive us home)...

It is a very interesting topic. Let me clear something out first. I am fully onboard for autonomous cars. What trips me a bit (and probably people who are trying to find evidence against autonomous cars) is all these claims of 20 million miles. How much more experience this is compared to a regular driver. Objectively speaking this is true. But on the other hand, you Derek said it yourself - this car will probably struggle on poorly maintained roads for example. And yet, myself a driver with only 130 000 km of experience (basically a rookie compared to this car) have no problem whatsoever driving on poorly maintained road or on a dirt road.

I am software engineer and I have tried to explain the benefits of self driving cars to people and I see a very common set of misconceptions.
What people seem to struggle to understand is that computer algorithm driving a car will be MUCH better than a human in 99% of the situations. The problem is that in the remaining 1%, due to their nature, computers tend to make mistakes that seem so obvious for us humans that we apply our confirmation bias and shot down the idea.

The thing is, as you said 99% of mistakes are basically not obeying the traffic laws or getting intentionnaly or unintentionally distracted. A computer will never do that. The thing is us humans alwasy think ""yeah, that will never happen to me, so I dont see the benefit for myself!"". The computer being a giant calculator looking for patterns might (in 1 in a million) find a pattern where there shouldn't be and execute a maneuver that may result in an accident. This is what we see with Tesla and with virtually any other brand at some point. The car driving seemingly perfect and  just make a turn and leave the road or simply ignore a stopped vehicle and cause an accident. This is the nature of algorithms. Poorly programmed or trained model could make such a mistake. Of course a human would react like ""WTF the car just made a right turn on the highway and got out of the road, a human would never make such a stupid mistake!"".

Of course such a mistake would be against (probably 100 000 mistakes on the human side) making it so extremely rare that statistically it is not even worth discussing.

My point with this long comment is that sometimes in their attempt to promote their progress, companies like Waymo make a big bold statement like ""we have 20 million miles of experience, much more than a human"" that they provoke a reaction like ""Oh yeah, 20 million miles, huh? I drove for 20 000 and I can drive on a poorly mainteined road and you cant!""

Maybe a bit more transparancy on what those numbers mean in reality and a bit more education on how things work and why they are better even though they seemingly sometimes make not the best judgements from the perspective of a human driver might push things in the right direction. A quick example is the quck sudden squeeking stop infront of the man with the cart. This kind of a stop is to be expected from a very rookie driver and even though I fully understand why such things happen, people will tend not to expect such ""attitude"" from someone or something that has droven 20 million miles.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Flying is still way safer than driving cars, and while flying does have autopilot, you can wonder why they don't have pilotless airplanes. There is just far too much decision-making for the computer to take into account in contrast to aviation and elevators, like you mentioned road conditions etc. I'm sure this technology is acceptable in certain areas of certain cities, but not acceptable everywhere in decades to come. Humans + fully autonomous AI's in traffic (such as this vehicle) do not mix well since humans are too unpredictable, giving the passenger in the backseat no chance to interfere with the AI's decision-making. The way is not to make fully autonomous vehicles, but to integrate AI into cars with a human driver like what Tesla is doing... :/",7,,True,none,['Tesla']

How expensive? So much that most cars advertised to be autonomous don't have more capabilities than a driver. Even wondered why Tesla is so bad at autonomous driving and makes mistakes no human would do? Because it sees even less than a human, that's the problem. 
Lidar or radar are required to see more than typical driver can, best is having both of them. Different wavelength used by lidar and radar will let them make better mapping. For example lidar can be mistaken by simple mirror and radar can be mistaken by other materials that are visible in the light but not exactly for the radar. 
Obviously you can't do that with simple camera and that's why people still don't trust it. They don't believe it will be done right and Tesla shows us that they are right. Using just cameras without any radar and lidar makes the car see only as much, as a human could. Of course it's better at math, it can monitor all cameras at once but it lacks some intelligence and because of it you have cases of driving into the truck trailer because it looked like the sky. Even better, traffic light detection does not distinguish yellow light from the moon. That's why so much people don't believe that it's the time for autonomous vehicles. Not because we don't have the technology to do that but the technology proposed for this is insufficient.

The system requires very high definition 3D maps that need to be constantly maintained. The tech itself on those cars still costs 6 figures and whilst economies of scale will eventually bring that down, it will still take many many years before it breaks even. 

It's wonderful technology though and we need the government to subsidise it to accelerate its widespread adoption. The economic benefits couldn't be clearer. 

I'm personally betting that Tesla will solve autonomy L5 that will over time just get better and better. Do not underestimate the power of Neural Nets and Machine Learning. If you're in any doubt then watch AlphaGo on Netflix or YouTube. 

Moving to vision only (no Radar) is a clear indication that they're confident they have the right strategy for a globally, instantly scalable solution. Version 9.1 of Tesla Vision drops tonight and it will be very interesting to see how much better than 9.0 it is.

Other than that the AI will just hit the brakes and pull over. Now for brake downs, For one brake downs in motion are rare but also they use redundant systems, for example, Tesla autopilot has several modules of fully functional processing units, in such a way that if one fails (say a short-circuit burns it) the other one kicks in, if it's power failure (sudden) the main systems have a backup, the battery is wired in such a way that if one section of the battery fails it Immediately jumps and starts draining a completely separate section of it.

In this fashion a section of the battery module is always working as a backup for the other section, The only way it could go wrong is if both sections fail at the same time and suddenly  (which is quite probabilistically low) I do not know for sure but I can almost guarantee there is emergency break leaver or button.

Waymo is ""better"" but not that much better.

20 million miles means virtually nothing when many of them occurred in Chandler which has wide, straight roads. Low traffic density. Virtually no pedestrians or animals, and sunny clear weather 350 days a year. Also, many of those miles took place in 2020 when nobody was on the road anyway. This is as close to controlled ""lab conditions"" as one can get, albeit still forcing the general public to participate in a technology experiment without their consent (Nuremburg has some words on that). Throw in dense traffic, high pedestrian density, snow, fog, deer, roads designed for horses with blind turns, etc and we've trained cars to self drive in the least common driving scenarios found on the planet.

I like how he talks about airplane autopilot like it's a guarantee safety feature and TOTALLY ignores Boeing and the 737 Max crashes that killed hundreds because the technology was not thoroughly tested before being deployed. This is a major problem with autonomous vehicles as a whole, a bug in the code is one thing on your smartphone, it's a wholly separate issue when it turns a two ton piece of machinery into an eradict and potentially lethal projection. It's one thing when there's a ""bug"" in a human but that human can be held accountable and is only responsible for their individual vehicle, it's a huge problem when that bug is instantly propogated across millions of vehicles and can't be overriden by the drivers (or they aren't expecting to need to override the systems...a stark contrast from pilots that are highly trained and paid to always be attentive). That's not even to address the cybersecurity issue, and we all know how great silicon valley is about cybersecurity.

Computers are great at being consistent, but the road is anything but consistent. Even without drivers there are too many variables from construction, to debris, to weather, to pedestrians that make the road chaotic. The sky is comparably far less complex as there's air traffic control, radar, a whole third dimension to maneuver in, and less objects to collide with as a whole. Humans on the other hand are terrible at being consistent, but fantastic at handling novel situations. That's not to say that self driving cars are a fool's errand, it's just to say that the technology is not ready for public roads and never should have been allowed (the algorithms don't even have to pass a driver's test like a 15 year old kid has too). Even experts in the industry are coming out and saying the technology is farther away than anticipated, many saying at least a decade away. Remember, we were supposed to have self driving cars by 2020 when the tech was first being hyped, and it's still in it's infancy with only one company having road trials (in the most lax regulatory state with the easiest road conditions). Even then, the cars drive erratically and get into collisions, where WAYMO refuses to disclose any contextual information about the events, and I've personally seen them constantly driving bike lanes. It seems like self driving cars might go the way of flying cars and cold fusion, a decade away, every decade.

Another issue is that they're comparing safety to the average american driver, which is a poor standard as we can pretty easily surmise that self driving cars will be replacing commercial and luxury vehicles first, two demographics that statistically are the safest drivers with millions of miles between collisions. In other words, the algorithms need to be far safer than the average driver to not LOWER average road safety in the adoption phase (these are things actuaries are already concerned about and they don't care about hype or promises, just raw data and risk).

Lastly, this all ignores a huge elephant in the room: cities designed around private individual cars, whether autonomous and electric or not, is a poor design model. Changing who and how a car drives does nothing to address the well studied problems that cities based on individual driving ALWAYS suffer more traffic, more pollution, more urban sprawl, more heat island, and more climate change problems. Technology, whether wider roads, or safer and faster cars, has never realized the promises made to sell the technology. The only things that do alleviate the problems of urban and suburban traffic are increased public mass transportation, and actively discouraging individual drivers. Imagine how bad the roads are going to be when all these autonomous vehicles are not kept in the garage but rather ""rented"" out with some kind of driverless Lyft service. Cars on the road could easily double as they all idle waiting for a fare, rather than sitting parked. Oh yeah, work from home is a far easier, cheaper, and faster to implement way to address the dangers of road, but it doesn't create a bunch of BS jobs to make a fundamentally flawed system appear less flawed without dramatically fixing anything (seat belts, crumple zones, and assisted driving/braking have already addressed the vast majority of the dangers of driving anyway).


I want autonomous vehicles, I'd love to not have to pay attention on road trips and not have to fly nearly as much. I'm pro the technology, but just because I'm for something doesn't mean the technology is anywhere near ready and should be ""generally regarded as safe"" just because we want it. That's the same logic that created Thalidomide or Theranos or so many failed kickstarters. Hype isn't the same as reality and technologists need to stop treating potentially lethal technology as a benign advancement with no risks.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

This video is worse than a TV ad - that's how much manipulation and misleading there is in it, it must have all been scripted by Google.

Let's start with elevators, I wonder if people would be still as comfortable riding in an automatic elevator if elevators had to navigate cross-roads, overtake other elevators, merge in elevator high-ways, etc. My guess is probably not :) Elevators are one of the simplest possible automatic systems, a basic elevator needs just a sensor at each level to trigger a stop. Besides, what would happen if an elevator misbehaves - you get to the wrong level or the elevator stops between levels and you have to wait for the technicians to get you out, it's not like it can crash into a lane divider and kill you. So, a very misleading example for an automatic system that everyone trusts, there is simply no base for comparison between elevators and self-driving cars.

Next misleading example - planes. True, planes are nowadays mostly flown and landed by autopilot, also true that in foggy conditions it's difficult for a human to land the plane due to the limitations of our visual system, but it's far from impossible, a human pilot can simply follow the readings of the runway radio beacons and still land the plane safely. This is similar to the elevator example (no cross roads, no merging traffic, etc., just follow the sensors), just a bit more complex as it is three dimensional. However, you know when ONLY a human pilot can land the airplane - in crosswind conditions, especially variable crosswinds. Veritasium didn't give that example, now did he.

I can go on like that for all examples he gave (and the little stab at Tesla, for the record I think Tesla is even more irresponsible regarding self-driving tech). The truth is, current self-driving AI technology (deep neural networks) is fundamentally unreliable (due to the mathematics of it). Worse still, it's like a black box, so when an accident happens, we wouldn't even know why it happened. If Veritasium wants to stake his life on a technology that gives no guarantees it won't crash into the next lamp-post he is certainly free to do that. Until a new breed of AI that is provably reliable and explainable is invented I won't be getting my foot into a self-driving car.",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

The pros and cons of Lidar, cameras, what kind of things cause autonomous cars to get confused and crash, and the ethics of having a loved one die due to their own or someone else's mistake on the road vs them being a casualty of computer error. Its too bad the sponsorship probably prevented that discussion. When you asked the ultimate question of the episode, ""are they better than the average human?"" it would've been nice to hear a more fleshed out answer instead of only an enthusiastic ""yes"" from a Waymo engineer and some arguably out of context statistics.

There is however legal limitations to level 4 in all countries, except for a few projects such as the Waymo.

Even my 4 year old Hyundai is at level 2. 

Now, that really has no bearing on your original question. The question of AP usage in crashes has come up numerous times, and while the legalities might become challenging at Level 5, which is rather limited if you still need to have a legally responsible human designated for each trip. (Certified, sober, awake, probably seated in the left front seat), there are lots of lots of interesting cases from the aviation world of where the responsibility crosses over from the Pilot in command (airline representative) to the manufacturer or the designer of the automated system involved in an accident. 

The question about data integrity likewise has come up both in the aircraft-world (Famously as early as Air France 296) but also with Tesla having had more than a few drivers blame their auto pilot when their right foot got too heavy, or when they opted to comment on you tube videos rather than watching the road, even when accepting full legal responisibility when enabling auto pilot. The integrity of the data itself has never really been put into question when reviewed by courts. It is not the easiest ¬´document fraud¬ª out there. 

It would be very hard to manipulate data in a way that wouldn‚Äôt contradict evidence pulled from other potential sources such as dash cams, witnesses, surveillance cams, the damages to the car and other vehicles, there are also inter-car comunication being developed, (ITS/Vanet/IVC type V2V-solutions)so within few years, the car would have comunicated quite a lot of data about its status to nearby vehicles that can be pulled and used as evidence.

Or, at least, I _hope_ that won't happen. As you briefly glossed over towards the end, most accidents with autonomous vehicles are going to happen because other drivers mess up, and cities are precisely where there are going to be the largest concentration of potentially error-prone human drivers. An ideal situation from a safety standpoint is actually the fully-autonomous vehicles becoming more common in suburbs and slowly moving into the cities. Kudos to Waymo for the intensive testing and realizing that half-measures won't work with our stupid ape brains, though; I'm remembering Tesla putting cars on the road that _did_ , in fact, hit stationary objects, and people doing ridiculous things (even filming a porn!) in their partially-autonomous vehicles. Anyway, hopefully they're right that autonomous vehicles reduce fatalities even in the face of human error, because, to touch on your analogies, that's the _real_ reason pilots are required to be in the cockpit during takeoff and landing. Fog isn't much of an obstacle to a computer with a perfect map of the runway system and knowledge of its own x,y,z coordinates, velocity, and acceleration; however, another aircraft with no autopilot or a sudden malfunction can cause collisions without a pilot to end the landing program and move out of the way. (That's also why the elevator analogy isn't a very good one: The most complicated part of driving or piloting is maneuvering around other drivers and pilots, which isn't something an elevator operator ever had to worry about.)

You're definitely skipping over the main reason that we won't be above 50% autonomous cars in the next five or even ten years, though: Economics. In ten years, I _might_ be able to afford a ten-year-old human-driven electric car (but probably not). It'll be even longer before I can afford an autonomous car. And I'm only hovering slightly above the poverty line; there's plenty of people well into poverty who need a car to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads; and even people who are safely lower-middle class don't tend to have _new_ cars, just not-quite-as-old used cars. Most people don't have new cars, because new cars are expensive, and new cars with the latest technology features are more expensive still. The average car on the road in the US is a decade old right now (actually, 12.1, but just coming out of lockdown, the economy's still a bit out of whack, bumping the average up a bit; it was hovering in the high 11.x before that), meaning many are even older.

Also, that motorcyclist with/without a helmet scenario isn't a very good one to begin with, and whoever made the video you clipped from also misunderstood the point of such scenarios. It's actually not a question of how well the car will perform, so much as it's a question of legal liability. To demonstrate, have a much better and more realistic example: What happens when someone has been tailgating you, and then the person in front of you stops short? The car is probably capable of stopping short to avoid the car in front, causing it to get rear-ended; and it's capable of recognizing the car behind is too close and fast, thus stopping slowly and hitting the car in front. That _isn't_ an uncommon situation, unfortunately, and it's entirely due to human driver error _by other drivers_ , meaning the autonomous car may not be able to avoid it. (No, you don't get to brush that one off with ""unlikely hypothetical scenarios."" I have first- and secondhand experience with _exactly_ that scenario at least five times over.) The sticking point is this: Which scenario is safer for the passengers of all three cars, and should the car potentially seek to preserve its own passenger's safety, even at the expense of another vehicle's driver's life? In that scenario, I can easily imagine a situation where hitting the front car would severely injure the passenger (say, by smashing their face into the dashboard), but getting hit by the rear car would kill the driver (maybe they're not wearing a seatbelt). This is all potentially knowable by the autonomous vehicle, so what heuristic is the best one to use when you know you're going to be in court for your programming someday? Once that choice is made, who gets the blame when someone is injured, partially as the result of that decision? The programmer? The manufacturer? The vehicle's owner? The vehicle's passengers, who presumably chose the route that put it on that road? Again, it's a question of liability, one that should probably be figured out now, but one which, given the way our courts run on precedent, probably won't actually be figured out until it actually happens. However, anyone who uses those scenarios to _criticize_ autonomous vehicles has a fundamental misunderstanding of what the problem actually is.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Before a waymo car can drive on a road the road first has to be 2d and 3d mapped processed and so on before the car is allowed to drive down that raod. After which the car knows every 10th of an inch of the whole street, this way they dont have to worry about anything else than the other things moving, such as people, cars and so on.

This strategy works quite well in suburbs and probably pretty well in bigger cities as well, but youd have to have a extremely detailed map of the entire earth before being able to take a road trip in it to where ever you want.

This is why this looks 100x better that the tesla and why it has all of these sensors, cause it needs to know where it is correlating to the premapped 3d world it has been given. New roads and so on (road construction especially) is therefor also one of the downsides to this strategy, since the car doesnt know what to do when the enviroment doesnt corelate to is map. 

Tesla is trying to do full autonomy, that in real time maps out its environment and surroundings and actively finds the safest yet quickest route to the destination

There is also the fact that car companies like tesla is right now thinking of making it a subscription model.
Just because it works in optimal condition on roads that is very near the place of people so they can fix it if anything breaks is a LONG way from being operational everywhere.

You can not compare airtravel and driving a car like you did in this video.
It is strict rules regulations on when and where you travel with an airplane you do not just take a commercial airliner and joy ride from one country to another.

Unless you mean that we are not supposed to drive other than X o'clock or between 13:20 and 13:25 or some random thing.

Now back to self-driving cars the roads around where i am is 2way roads the road itself is good the speed limit is 80km/h but it is only 1 and a half lane you often have to back off to let other cars past self driving cars have been shown to be really bad at these roads.
Now if anything does go wrong here you are either in water depending on where you are exactly between 1 and 500meters deep, or you are in the mountainside. Or you head-on collision the other car.
Now if the cars was proven to work very well and willing to back off if needed in these situations and so on and so forth we are starting to get there.

Having a driverless car being able to drive in a 3-6lane highway going straight or being very close to a team of people able to help the car make the right choices is Not the reality if driverless cars is going to be very common or for everyone.

It is easier to make 1 car with a whole team behind it work and function but you will not have a whole team behind every single car on the road you can not be remotely monitoring it like they are doing here.",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

Driverless cars won't help the middle bit that much, except if they really do have other things to do, the car will be better than them by some amount just by dint of more eyes, and unlimited object tracking. It could go either way.

Driverless cars won't be better than the top 25% of drivers, the people who drive so much and practice so much, the gamers who have been shown to have greater object tracking skills. The professional racers, who spend 10k hours tracking objects and speeds and know their car physics.

The comparison to planes is a bad one, plane pilots are supposed to be *well trained* and that pilot who put the plane in reverse on accident I'm sure was fired for gross incompetence. The average driver is *not* professionally trained, so of course the computer is going to be better than a minority of drivers, but the computer is only superior at flying a plane when the pilot would get 0 information from the outside world. The plane has gps and radar and all sorts of stuff the pilot doesn't. I completely agree that the solution is just train drivers better, and then we reduce 25% of all accidents. But as long as we allow drivers to be amateurs, then sure, driverless robot cars will be better than at least 25% of drivers.

I'm at least average, and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that 73% of people thinking they're above average is a bad thing, because only 1/3rd of those people are wrong. 50% of the population is above average, by definition, even if by a miniscule amount. When I drive by myself, with no (or few, like a good song on Pandora) distractions, I am way better of a driver than any computer could be with the same amount of data input. It's just a factor of the neural nets that make up physics prediction.

When I have other riders, or distractions, I'm no better than average, but I'm still better than the 25% at the bottom that are physically dangerous to be around.

I recently got a nice (used) Toyota sienna with laser powered cruise control, and it is the nicest cruise control I have ever had. No other car I have ever owned has been capable of performing as well, and the controls are all on a single gamer-friendly knob, instead of random buttons I have to read every time.

That said, it's from 05, it doesn't know how to do calculus to know when to stop accelerating. If it sees it is going more than 5 mph different than what you set it, it up shifts, sometimes twice, and then it'll shoot past it's target, sometimes even into detection range of another car, then slowing way down, it doesn't know how to solve for time of acceleration, it's really obvious.

But, if you get it up to the correct speed manually, it maintains that speed WAY better than a foot-powered foot ever could, so in that way, I use it as a manual throttle lock, instead of a real cruise control. I'm always attentive of it, because even with car detection, it doesn't work great driving into the sun, or driving in the rain. Additionally, on the highway it has no idea about lanes, and I have to physically pause it, or switch lanes before it tries to slow me down when I pass.

Are self driving cars better than that? Yeah, even a shitty Tesla like what electroboom has can lane switch, but it has obvious failure modes too. Maybe that's because it's not ""grade four driverless"" or whatever, but ultimately I won't ever drive a car that I can't be in control of, because the car is a tool for me to use, not a chauffeur.

Cruise is a tool. ABS is a tool. Sonar range finders are a *tool* and when driverless becomes a thing, I will still use it as a tool. Even if I don't have to have my hands on the wheel, it *will not* be better at prediction and physics than me, only at multitasking and long distance sign reading (curse my nearsighted genes!) And reactions as well, but if it hasn't identified the problem correctly then it doesn't matter if it's reaction is .0001 seconds, because I'll have to take over in .01 seconds anyway.

An average or above average driver will be better than a computer at solving for edge cases. A bottom 25% driver may as well switch to driverless in 15 years when they're actually affordable.

This is a nice video, and I wasn't aware that full driverless was actually this advanced, I was still under the impression it was at grade 3 or lower, but when people said the technology is 10 years away they weren't wrong.

Richard Branson went to space, it'll be 50 years before I can afford it. it'll be 10 before you can afford it.

Self driving cars (or even electric) will be 10 years before they're common in the market, and 30 before they're affordable.

I really want a cybertruck. But do you know how much I'd have to make you afford one? It's not really feasible for most of the population. You live in a very narrow entitled slice.",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

Another thing is that ofcourse a car is not gonna be as negligent as a human who is intoxicated or wreckless but there can always be sensor malfunction which can cause accidents. 
Also in a long term, a lot of driverless car might get rid of lidar tech to cut costs and move to a camera-only autopilot system (just like tesla as per Elon) which again can be worse in bad weather.

The problem isn't that there is a sponsor, that's fine, the problem is that the scientific approach that is typically yours, where questions are asked and an answer is searched for, at least feels compromised. You sound like you're saying what the sponsor wants us to hear, but wrapping it in a veneer of sciency stuff. Except many of the arguments made ring hollow or inaccurate. There are many problems with autonomous vehicles, and you only show the viewpoint of the sponsor, which is in no position to make an objective assessment, and we know it.

Modern AI is arguably not learning anything, just memorizing an immense library of patterns. We do not have any feasibly ability to audit the source code of the self-driving vehicles because there essentially isn't any, just an impossible to untangle mess of various learned models taped together, with a bunch of layers. Anyone who worked in software knows how things can get really ugly really fast in the real world, even when humans know what the software is meant to do and how it's designed, and from what little has transpired out of companies like Tesla, we know their software efforts do not exist on some ethereal plane of existence where the typical problems don't apply.

Those vehicles are trained in often unrealistic scenarios: only on simple, wide, straight american (st)roads, or only in clear weather conditions, or with training data with ""exceptional"" events culled away for easier training. You make the analogy to elevators and airplanes, but really that's silly, because those are effectively on rails, much like trains. Cars are _not_ trains and roads at _not_ rails. The possibility space is much smaller, and there is no complex reading of human behavior required to insert in elevator or air corridor traffic. On a road, you come into much closer contact, at much faster speeds, with other agents, who are very hard to predict and to read, even for humans sometimes. Simply playing it safe and avoiding the hard situations will not work in the real world, and neither will deferring to a driver who was told they could relax. Asking for an overnight transition is even less.

Context is impossible for self-driving cars to understand: a suicidal person walking towards the road with bad intentions, kids playing on the side, people having a bbq, or whatever context where people are in line of sight for the car, are impossible to distinguish for an AI, it will just see people near the road. Because of that, the car will be tuned to react overly confident, or underconfident, or likely both. How does a driverless car react to other dangerous drivers attempting road-rage manoeuver ? Yes it won't get ""angry"", but it can still very likely get outside of comfortable operation conditions and be put in a situation it wasn't trained on. What about learner drivers ? Intoxicated drivers ? Someone having a stroke ? A mechanical failure ?

A human does need training to react to every possible scenario, because it has a _brain_ and understands what it is doing. What humans are trash at is boring driving conditions and boring everyday commutes where people are effectively driving in autopilot mode themselves, not fully aware of the situation. This is where driving aids come into their own, and can augment the driver awareness. This is desirable. What I'm less sure about is leaving that sweet spot for systems that involve the human so little it completely loses any involvement, because then the human insight into context is lost to the vehicle.

The next part is this tech is exploitable. Adversarial attacks on those networks are not a new thing, and that's before you get in the actual infosec security issues of having fully drive-by-wire cars with network connectivity to the drivetrain. You'd be hard pressed to find _any_ security researcher who's honestly _not_ nervous about safety-critical closed-source systems connected to the internet, let alone who would trust one with his own life.

Lastly I don't like what this means in a world were all cars are autonomous. This tech isn't free, it is owned by some of the biggest conglomerates who already have a dangerous level of control over our lives. In a future where only autonomous cars are allowed, and where we no longer own our cars, we are now tributary of the whims of that corporation for getting around. Losing your google account is bad enough today, but tomorrow it could mean you can get stranded. Or it could mean a cartel could own the pricing for transportation and artificially raise it for profit maximization. We've seen how that does wonders already in plenty of areas in tech. Forfeiting the privilege of driving to machines means losing it to a couple dozen companies, who will exert total control on who is allowed on the roads, which were supposed to be public infrastructure.

Is human freedom worth loss of life ? Now you have some real questions to discuss, and historically the answer has been a big fat ""it's complicated"".",32,,True,none,['Tesla']

IMO autonomy in the sense that you can take a car and put it anywhere where there are road markings will be solved first by Tesla and later on everybody will just license their solution because developing their own would take too much money and time.

I think successful testing in one of the driest places in the country does not really prove a whole lot.

Also not all driverless car systems are created equal, and Tesla‚Äôs system which does not have LIDAR does indeed hit stationary objects. Yes I know Tesla isn‚Äôt level 4 but that is the crack the Musk is selling.

LIDAR also struggles in certain conditions such as rain and snow‚Ä¶. Which Phoenix Arizona doesn‚Äôt see a lot of.

Speaking of rain and snow and varying road conditions. Here in the north you can go from perfect grip to zero grip in feet. How would such a system detect black ice? It doesn‚Äôt even have the ability to detect when the road is wet.

Finally what happens when these systems get old and start seeing degradation of sensors and processors. Has anyone here seen a computer work bug free for years on end? Silicon Valley can‚Äôt even get a laptop or cellphone to last more than a couple years let alone a car‚Ä¶. Aerospace is more qualified to do this engineering.

When such a bug does happen and the car does cause a crash who is responsible? The owner wasn‚Äôt driving so it‚Äôs not their fault? The company who makes the system isn‚Äôt going to accept liability on vehicles they don‚Äôt own.

What does the liability issue mean? Well for one there will be fewer owners of cars on the road because these companies will demand they operate their own fleets (like what is done here). Only 2 or 3 companies will be able to develop this technology. As we‚Äôve all seen when only one or two providers are available (LOOKING AT YOU ISPs) costs go higher.

Ultimately I think this is a very hopeful and naive look at the subject. I watch this channel because usually the dive is deeper. The technology for driverless cars will be here in 10 years, but the legal framework will not be here for at least 20.",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

So, context...

Waymo is able to ""pull over"" for a siren because of the microphone that is integrated.

Elon Musk said that Tesla cars will be able to do the same thing. Some people have talked about it online but most people seem confused due to a absence of ""microphones"" that tesla has on the perimeter of their vehicles. 

I was wondering, 
maybe Tesla could use their ultrasonic sensors to capture harmonic partials of the siren through the receiver and use ai accordingly? I don't know if the sensors have one or two diaphragms for the transmitter and receiver, I can't seem to find this information. I don't know the frequency response of the transducers but I'd assume it will be outside of the human hearing range due to it being an ultrasonic device. 

Would it be possible to use the receiver (transducer) of the ultrasonic sensors to capture harmonic partial frequency content of a siren? I won't go into signal to noise ratios, sensitivity, doppler effect and DSP here. 

I just finished my first year studying sound science and technology at university (So not an expert).

Lidar only works in good weather conditions (e.g. heavy fog or water spray from cars in front is deadly), same for cameras. And those ranges of 300m for lidar and 500m for camera sound absolutely unbelievable! Like, pick any sign on a local road, walk 500m away, take a picture and then try to read the sign in the image. You won't. Typical ranges one talks about when using cameras in autonomous driving are like 100-150m max.

Also, you see at least 4 Lidar-Sensors mounted on the car in the video. Has anyone thought about the cost? The 360¬∞ one on top is at least 30,000$, the others probably like half of that each. On top of that you have the 28(!) cameras (some of them with expensive lenses, if they are supposed to come even close to what is claimed) and several radar sensors. The latter typically cost about 1,500$ each. In sum this means that just the sensor equipment costs more than most normal cars! How is this supposed to go into a mass-produced consumer product?

Last point I want to make: energy consumption. With electric cars we are already talking about their comparably low driving range. All of these sensors and especially the GPUs/TPUs and processors needed to make use of the data need a lot, and I really mean *a lot*,  of power. This doesn't go well together at all.
(Before anyone mentions Tesla: They have never used close to this many sensors or had such a high level of automation. And there is a reason why they recently announced that they will exclusively rely on cameras in the future.)

Overall, I must say that this video feels like a big (false) advertisement to me, as harsh as that may sound. Not for Waymo specifically, but autonomous cars in general. Maybe Derek is just a tad too excited about them?",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

I'm a researcher in the area of autonomous driving and I also think Derek is way too optimistic here.

As you say, Lidar only works in good weather conditions (e.g. heavy fog or water spray from cars in front is deadly), same for cameras. And those ranges of 300m for lidar and 500m for camera sound absolutely unbelievable! Like, pick any sign on a local road, walk 500m away, take a picture and then try to read the sign in the image. You won't. Typical ranges one talks about when using cameras in autonomous driving are like 100-150m max.

Also, you see at least 4 Lidar-Sensors mounted on the car in the video. Has anyone thought about the cost? The 360¬∞ one on top is at least 30,000$, the others probably like half of that each. On top of that you have the 28(!) cameras (some of them with expensive lenses, if they are supposed to come even close to what is claimed) and several radar sensors. The latter typically cost about 1,500$ each. In sum this means that just the sensor equipment costs more than most normal cars! How is this supposed to go into a mass-produced consumer product?

Last point I want to make: energy consumption. With electric cars we are already talking about their comparably low driving range. All of these sensors and especially the GPUs/TPUs and processors needed to make use of the data need a lot, and I really mean *a lot*,  of power. This doesn't go well together at all.
(Before anyone mentions Tesla: They have never used close to this many sensors or had such a high level of automation. And there is a reason why they recently announced that they will exclusively rely on cameras in the future.)",0,UgxFBLjd2p7Te0lPzEN4AaABAg,True,none,['Tesla']

What do you mean by this? It's not like driverless cars are massively different design-wise, especially ones designed to blend in, such as the fully autonomous Tesla models, so we won't see cars get bigger or taller, once the technology matures and sees more widespread acceptance. Plus, driverless cars are being tested on current streets, and theoretically could actually handle tight streets *better*, as they can make split-second decisions with full awareness of everything going on around them at all times, which is something a human just couldn't ever achieve.

*""and even when their fully electric they create polution from tire ware etc""*

Regular cars that are designed for human drivers have this exact same problem, so it's kind of irrelevant.

*""we need better public transport and. atonmous electric cars to take us to the trainstation and to service more rural areas""*

Agree here, fully autonomous driving technology could come to public transport options, allowing many people to reap the benefits of fully autonomous vehicles without adding more vehicles onto our streets, but...

*""but not in cities, at least not for average abled person on an average day""*

... I don't see why this has to be the case. As I said above, theoretically, a fully autonomous vehicle could handle tight streets with lots of dynamic obstacles such as pedestrians, parked vehicles and other vehicles on the road far better than a human ever could, so they'd honestly see even better use in cities, where public transport is so much more useful.",0,UgxBumaoUyOm725DHhp4AaABAg,True,none,['Tesla']

Thats probably the most disappointing video you have made yet. Waymo advertisement much. Wow.
Why didnt you look at the other problems with driverless cars? Why just spew the Waymo doctrine?

Couple of key problems. Over a _decade_ ago people were promising driverless cars in less than a couple of year. In fact 20 years ago Mercedes had driverless cars, but they said at the time, we need to have smart roads, not smart cars (I personally agree with this). Same with strong AI, this has _not_ come to pass and will not likely happen until we solve fundamental issues with our AI systems. The need for driverless cars is also waning because of covid and remote work. You simply dont need a driverless car if you are not traveling much - and a large portion of the world, this is what is happening. Additionally Waymo is currently desperate for funding - they are around $20B in the hole and desperately need to have some wins (I hope recent investors havent put too much in). Tesla too - still not making money on their cars. 

Couple this with the problem of needing ""nice roads"", nice weather and nice lighting for driverless to work best (hence why its in Phoenix) and other roads and areas it does not handle well (they are even marked so they go around these areas) means we are a very long way from autonomous vehicles. Sure, as a monorail.. they are great fun.. but that wears off if you need adoption. Do you remember what happens to monorails?

I ask a simple question. Why dont we reinstate trains and trams and other good high density transport? Cars are the _worst_ form of transport for our planet due to their sparse density, pollution, infrastructure waste and  the capacity to maim and hurt others. It seems insane that 100 yrs ago we had better transport systems for moving people around than we do now. 
Crazy... 

I hope you make a more balanced look at driverless car systems. Look at the last 50 yrs of dev for them, and the hyperbole in the last 10 years. They are their own worst enemy. As an ultimate concept I would love to see driveless cars implemented like in the short story, ""Ranbows End"". But the reality of this is very very unlikely.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Don't get me wrong, it's great that this company has managed to do so much with the service so far, but it not a solution to traffic and it is not a solution to moving people from place to place efficiently. Certainly they've managed to accumalate more data than I thought they would and I have no doubt that it'll grow exponentially as they add more cars to their fleet and therefore the system will become better.

A big problem I see is that this tech seems to be proprietry, or at least I've not heard of any open source version of full self driving. Which is why Tesla has had to develop their own version which unlike Waymo's has actually seriously hurt people. The database needs to be open source to allow all self-driving car companies to have the level of safety that Waymo has, and in return they contribute to the database making it even larger and therefore even better and safer than Waymo can achieve on their own.

Sure, we all chuckle at that - but how useful is self-reporting when a significant percentage of people have lots of Dunning-Kruger Effect, little objectivity and are generally wrong? Suppose you gave people a test of some sort, then asked them some self-reporting questions. Could you factor out whose likely to be wrong about their self-reporting?  Factoids like this wind up only being useful as jokes. 
And ""Human error is the cause of 94% of accidents."" What does that even mean? 
There's a road north of Cabo San Lucas to Todos Santos that if it was in the United States there would be just as many fatal accidents on it. (No shoulder, huge drop offs, go off that road and you'll likely die - there are shrines to the dead everywhere, on most roads in the U.S. you veer off the paved road you'll hear gravel, mutter uh-oh and not even remember it happening.)  'Went off the road, turned over...' as a cause of death is I am sure listed as 'Human Error.' Is it the error or the road that killed the people in those vehicles on the Todos Santo road? 
And Waymo.  ""If you have a vehicle with lidar and radar and 29 cameras, you're not going to hit them"" ...or go anywhere outside of a small part of Phoenix, Arizona, and  the vehicles will be compact cars that cost more than $400,000.  And require a room full of techs watching on computers. Yeah, those Waymo cars sure are amazing.  I've rented cars in Scotland and Japan and driven on roads I'd never seen before (I love traffic roundabouts) and did just fine. I even missed hitting the first fox, also the second, to ever dart in front of a car I'm driving.  I made some bonehead mistakes but as I wasn't on the road to Todos Santos I survived.  I also know that the Tesla Model Y I've been driving for the past 9 months can just about do as well. One thing it does exceptionally well is stay on the road in the lane. So Todos Santos? Not a problem. (For Waymo Flagstaff, Tucson and all of Mexico may as well be on Mars.) 
And if my Tesla gets in an accident (all the serious traffic accidents I've been in were not in anyway my fault - or avoidable by me ) then Tesla's safety features will keep me from dying - even if it goes off the edge of that road to Todos Santos. (A model S went off a cliff a couple of weeks ago, everyone survived.) 
This is a meta analysis video which is a polite way of saying it's a not very deep commercial for Waymo.  A lot of information distilled by some other party,  so it's like averaging averages.  (The Trolley Problem - really? what are we 15?)  and then some cheery statements. I'm almost certain I'll win this discussion when Tesla FSD becomes either the universally used system of self-driving or is the basis of it. Waymo ... might be useful in limited situations, perhaps in limited 'geo-fenced' areas where zero errors can be tolerated, moving nuclear waste, transferring explosives at a mining site, luggage trains on airport tarmacs.  
The mark of a BS report on the state of autonomous driving in the 2020s? They don't include Tesla, unless it's some snarky bit about a few misbehaving Tesla drivers.  The New York Time in the past two months ran two of them. In one they quoted a source saying autonomous driving isn't likely to happen in 30 years. Why don't they include flat earthers in stories about space?  Waymo is interesting but this is an embarrassing fluff piece.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

Obviously we shouldn't rush things inappropriately, we should make sure each system is significantly better than the average human (with data to prove it) before allowing wide launch, but to wait for perfection is tantamount to murder.

I'm not sure who will get self driving solved first, but I'm glad that there are multiple groups of skilled and dedicated people working on it. I don't know if Waymo's approach of high definition maps with lidar and a team that looks like it has more people than cars will win out, or if Tesla's larger fleet, collecting data from the wild, and using primarily vision (I think they still have ultrasonic sensors, but they've dropped radar and never had lidar) will get there faster. I think either approach can work to be honest.

I'm not convinced that almost full-self driving cars are more dangerous though, even if people pay less attention because they are overconfident. People already pay less attention than we should when driving. The question is whether the probability of a near full self driving car crashing while the pilot isn't paying attention is greater or less than the probability of a non-self driving car crashing while the driver isn't paying attention. Depending on how reliable the self driving system on the car is, the degree to which the pilot has to not pay attention to exceed the non self driving baseline varies greatly. For example, if you just have lane keeping assistance, taking your eyes off the road for even a few seconds is extremely dangerous, if you have Tesla fsd beta (v9 is most up to date right now I think), you are pretty unlikely to have an accident in a few seconds of inattention, even though you should keep paying attention throughout. We don't have good external data on any of these fsd systems (at least none that I've been able to find), but I suspect that people trust it less than they trust themselves when driving, and as a result even partially self driving systems are safer, with the twist that people who have more experience and therefore more trust in the system they use are less attentive and slightly more likely to be in an accident than new users, but still overall less likely to be in a collision than an unassisted driver. I'd really like to see better data on this.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

I personally don't mind the idea of driverless cars themselves. But depending on how strictly they follow road regulations and what their normal behavior is, I could see human drivers getting frustrated or driving erratically, and producing some very unusual edge-case situations. Which is what questions like the motorcyclists explore, that delve into really interesting (and sometimes unrealistic) moral dilemmas and conclusions. I also think that driverless cars, in a way, are really just another form of public transportation, depending on how they're implemented - though what many cities and countries have currently could certainly be adopted more effectively in the states, as other people have pointed out.

But beyond that, there are A LOT of questions that went unanswered in this video. Starting with the technology, LiDAR is already well documented to be a significant health risk to people's (and animals')eyes, in a world where we already have an enormous amount of radio wave transmissions. Sure, Google only has a handful of cars out right now, but if, say, a tenth of the vehicles on the road are driverless and rely on LiDAR for a significant portion of their information about the outside world,  what will that do to the general population? And there are ethical questions as well. Google is already renowned for being incredibly intrusive and selling user data - what's to say they wouldn't use information from their cars, too?
I'm aware that TESLA is utilizing very different technology for their driverless features. There are just a lot of things worth considering when there's any sort of automation like this - what's the technology that you put into it? What are the risks? And what are the alternatives? And how exploitable is it?",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

As a programmer that has played with ML, my guess is that it would only take a couple of years for them to adapt their software but they would have to commit to it, put cars on the roads, experiment, let them learn in that environment, and I just don't see any company being willing to do that just yet. On the other hand, if they are serious about a wide release, I can't think of a better way to train the cars. Put them in Canada, put them in the rocky mountains, put them in rural Louisiana where roads and road signs are more of an idea than a concrete reality. in a few years, they'd be able to handle anything.

I have serious doubts about the industry's code deployment processes, given their move-fast-and-break-things mindset and ideological hatred of regulators -- this is especially true of Tesla. If Waymo makes a software change, how is it tested (virtually and on real streets) before it's deployed to their vehicles? How frequently are those updates made? What regulations is the company willing to accept to ensure that catastrophic bugs don't make it onto the streets? The millions of miles of real-world driving with minimal accidents are great, but how many iterations of the software does that cover? And critically, what weather conditions/traffic density/road-map/etc scenarios do those tests cover? By starting in Arizona, they've chosen the friendliest possible environment and many challenges lay ahead. 

I hate driving, but I agree that people are horrendous drivers who should be torn from the wheel as soon as is practicable. But, I'm deeply skeptical of my industry's ability to deliver and maintain life-saving and -threatening code -- easy enough in the short term, but incredibly difficult long term as teams get bored once a problem is ""solved"".

Management starts squeezing the development teams to do more with less and faster in order to boost their margins, etc. Strong regulation slows things down and adds cost, but it can save lives in the long run.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

While true that self-driving cars can't make ""human error"" mistakes (as 8:42 states), these are traded-off for different systematic errors: distraction and rule-breaking get traded out for sensor failure and uncaught corner cases in the software. Overall I personally think this tradeoff will indeed result in fewer total fatalities, so Derek's streamlining this nuance out to strengthen his case is understandable. But making the case, as Derek implies here, that ""automated driving is 100% safe"" is vulnerable to anecdotal counter-example (e.g. Tesla's failure to detect a white semi-truck in plain daylight) in a way that ""automated driving has a set of fatal errors smaller than human drivers"" doesn't (even if it is less succinct).",1,,True,none,['Tesla']

A lot of the video was dedicated toward human attitudes and behaviour regarding self driving cars, while very little was focussed on technology readiness. Eg. how will the cars handle it if EVERY car is fitted with LIDAR? Surrounded by 100 cars each with multiple LIDARs will it still function or be rendered useless, perhaps something in between with phantom detections?

There was so much nuance that was either brushed over or ignored, attributing poor performance to such throwaway comments as, ""in some parts of the world the roads aren't well enough maintained."" Meanwhile you're driving round in perfect conditions on very wide American style roads, many of which are dual carriageways. Try that Waymo car on a narrow country road in the UK and see how it does, my bet is that it would cross the lane divider frequently just as Tesla's do too. Self driving cars that are trained on very wide american roads are actually dangerous and not fit for purpose on narrower UK and European roads. They also seem to be averse at making strong control inputs, which means that tight turns and corners are an issue for them, but again not a problem on wide roads with sweeping turns, and all intersections meet at 90 degrees.

I'm not a luddite, and I of course accept that in certain conditions and on certain types of road (essentially dual carriageways and motorways), they are undoubtedly better drivers and never suffer lapses in concentration. However I have not seen anything to suggest that any self driving tech has even come close to driving safely on smaller and more congested roads.

With regards to your poll at 1:20 these options are not mutually exclusive, I am both excited to see a future where they exist and function well, but at the same time I still think it will be >10 years before full unmonitored self-driving is ready.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

(Presumably they've fixed the driving into the side of the bus thing, I'll assume that for the moment.). But the problem isn't making it work 99% of the time.  It's the 1%...the long tail.

- a sudden downpour in which visibility drops to nearly nil in seconds (what do you do if moving?)
- a construction zone where the old lines have been blacked out, and new ones placed, but at an angle, reflection off both old and new make them look similar, and suddenly it's not clear where the lines are
- a flash flood (happened a few miles down the highway from where I'm sitting)
- whiteout from blowing snow
- 1000 other such things

Judgment, and the ability to improvise, rather than 1000 years of driving history, is a major way to deal with these.

I got enthusiastic about self drive when DARPA stopped holding self drive challenges because the technology was too good...no longer an advanced research topic, in their view, apparently.  And when Google (pre Waymo) published a video of their vehicle sitting things that humans didn't.

But then less so when events showed this to be premature hype, like the car driving into the side of the bus, or a number of seemingly inexcusable Tesla accidents (like not distinguishing that a stopped fire truck wasn't an overhead road sign...say what?  You're at what level of driving?) or driving into the side of a tractor trailer when sunlight blinded.

It'll take more than a drive on a nice day on multi lane roads to convince me.  Show me it driving in a sudden squall, with children piling out of a school, poor lighting, driven rain making the lidar picture more complicated, shopping bags blowing down the street, and maybe a homework assignment amongst those.

A lot was made of the number of miles driven, but little was made about how quickly AI can learn relative to humans. Humans don't need millions of miles to understand the context around them. They just need a few thousand at most. There weren't any really hard intersections, blind corners, wet roads, or what AI people call ""edge cases"" here. A lot can be said on this. Tesla has perhaps some of the best data on drivers, and granted they don't use LIDAR, but the latest version shows what the machine can see, which certainly seems good enough (e.g., LIDAR can see a stop sign 500m away, but how useful is that information for the car - probably not that useful at all). But a few videos of their system in much more complex scenarios shows how quickly the system fails to perform.

Also, the study quoted here says 6.1 million miles of driving with 18 ""incidents"". Looking at the average data for the US, there are about 2.6 deaths per billion miles driven. There are also about 100x as many accidents as deaths (based on my searching). Assuming my math is correct, you can estimate that over the same 6.1 million miles, you would only expect 2.1 crashes that damage property. That's quite a bit less. And explaining away some of the incidents as due to other human error doesn't get around the issue, because a) AI cars need to drive with humans, b) those are likely those ""edge cases"" where humans often know how to react without an incident, and c) the human crash statistics include ""other driver error"" as well.

Finally, you didn't at all get into the problems of security with things like hacking or purposeful modification of signage to confuse AI systems (which are often labelled as ""brittle"" to such changes). There's just so much that could go wrong. Generally, this channel shows a lot of the picture, but on this topic there's so much missing from this message.

In the US over 3 Trillion miles are driven each year. Approximately 6 million car accidents (of any kind, most are harmless and won‚Äôt even cause significant property damage) happen in that same time frame. So per million miles driven there are approximately 2 accidents.

Waymo with their 20 million miles driven and only 18 accidents, is just below 1 accident per million miles. Or about twice as safe as a human driver. This is also before you account for the fact that the US average includes things like truck drivers driving hundreds of miles a day on the same lonely back highways of the Western US where you barely encounter any cars and thus are incredibly unlikely to crash lowering the collision average significantly compared to urban and suburban areas where Waymo does most of their driving.

So in terms of capabilities I would definitely say we‚Äôre here in terms of self-driving.

Also as a note: Telsa‚Äôs seld-driving options are at most a 2-3 (for regulation purposes they are a 2) on the self-driving scale provided, essentially they are currently more akin to early Waymo examples of people being responsible for the driving and needing to assist the car from time to time, but leaving too much up to the car and getting distracted.

For those who have no idea what I'm talking about: Lidar is not a scalable solution for self driving. It can only operate in pre-mapped areas and the car is essentially traveling on rails. Compared with Tesla's vision only approach, you could take a Tesla, drop it anywhere on the planet, even if a Tesla has never driven there before and it would drive successfully.

The way I see it, self-driving cars are the solution to a strictly American problem. The problem of 'what if I want to go somewhere, but don't want to drive?'. Where I live, in the Netherlands, we have many more options for transport than cars. We can of course cycle there, walk there, take the bus, take the train, or any combination of those to get to our destination. We don't have a desire for self-driving cars because that's essentially what our public transport does for us. 

The self-driving car isn't the *only* solution to traffic accidents, either. Getting people off the road and onto public transport is a solution, for one, but road design also plays a huge part in how drivers act. The wide, straight roads (or stroads, as they're called) you see in America do the exact opposite of create a driver-friendly environment, as they only instigate people to drive faster.

Another point to me is that self-driving cars would absolutely not work here in the Netherlands. I see a lot of American roads that are wide, give a lot of space and vision for cars, and are generally convenient to navigate,. Those are much less common here. We have lots of roads where cyclists, pedestrians, and cars all go on the same narrow, low-vision roads. Drivers have to make a lot of complicated decisions and manoeuvrers like getting out of the way onto the pavement to make space for an oncoming car, or judging whether or not you have the time and space to pass a group of cyclists. I'm not it's impossible, but for an AI to pass these problems it would practically need to have human level intelligence.

Everyone getting in their own self-driving car to their destination is like the Tesla tunnel to me. Instead of everyone getting in a separate one-person vehicle, it could've simply been a subway that packs hundreds of times the amount of passengers per hour at a much better energy efficiency. 

All in all, self-driving cars don't look like a solution to me. Safer, yes, but not the solution to traffic or travel time or walkability or lack of public transport. They look more like a band-aid fix that only distract from the real problem of car-centric city design",0,,True,none,['Tesla']

One of the big reason behind being expensive is the cost of Lidar ( which definitely will come down over time ) so its not a major concern. The bigger issue is their reliance on hd maps which is not scalable.  Their reliance on hd maps also means that they are not very flexible ( say a spot which previously was empty now has construction ). A huge problem in Machine Learning is the long tail of rare events and you simply cant get those edge cases and train the model for it unless and until you have a huge fleet of cars in diverse conditions sending you feedback. So i am quite certain when autonomous cars become commonplace, Waymo isnt going to be the leader or winner in this segment, it will very very likely be Tesla.

C'mon now, anyone who has worked with computers will tell you that no one should ever be that confident with software. Will they be better than humans? Probably. Will they never make certain mistakes? Of course they will, it'll just be less frequent.

I was in a Tesla Model S yesterday where the driver was showing off the 'autonomous' driving part (and I know it's not the same level of automation, but this is why people are wary of full autonomous driving cars) and in a section with lots of cars parked along one side of the road (making cars going the direction we were have to straddle the white line, which is fairly common where I live) he had to intervene as the Tesla tried to turn quite sharply into a parked car to try and get back on to the right side of the line. It literally tried to drive itself into a car, and you say machines can't make that mistake whilst also showing a video of a car driving itself straight into a stationary lorry on a motorway (again, a mistake that no machine should be making). 

Plus the landing example is an order of magnitude easier than driving, there's far fewer variables/other vehicles to consider, better signage/systems (those automous landing systems generally require a large amount of infrastructure on the airfield to guide them in), and far fewer interactions/chances of collisions for any given amount of time.",1,,True,none,['Tesla']

The main problems I've seen in the field are older car companies not understanding how to develop software in general and newer companies that overestimate the results that their NN-based solutions get. In both cases you end up with an autopilot that would occasionally catastrophically fail. Waymo knows how to develop software and the hardware they use is complete overkill so it is very expensive but at least guarantees a minimum level of safety. And a lot of it comes down to using the ridiculously expensive but also very reliable LIDAR. Tesla's solution is entirely based on NNs processing camera images which doesn't give you this baseline safety and you can see it in their accidents. The autopilot often fails in trivial situations due to the limitations of NNs. Their whole concept is based on doing what the human brain does but they've skipped the step where the human brain uses simple and hard-wired algorithms to generate 3D data from the two ""cameras"" we have. A fully autonomous car can be made entirely using cameras but not without simpler and more predictable perception algorithms compared to what Tesla are doing. You don't necessarily need LIDAR, though cheaper LIDAR would be warmly welcomed. And you have to keep in mind that a solution that would lead to most cars on the road being autonomous would mean that the autopilot shouldn't add too much cost to the total cost of the vehicle. And I would say $2000 is a good approximation of this limit. A LIDAR or NN heavy solution cannot get even close to this limit.

(1 million cars x 60 miles per day, average).  Those ""simulated"" miles are extremely dubious.  Who verifies that what the simulation does is realistic?  Consider a deer crossing the road ahead of you, at night.  How many deer interactions are there in 20 million miles of real world data?   I'd guess maybe a few hundred - but deer interactions are complicated.  How the deer reacts depends not just on it's own desires - but also on the time of day, time of year, the weather, whether there are other cars coming from a different direction, your speed, whether there are baby deer with it's momma, whether it's the rutting season...stuff we can't even imagine.   You simply cannot capture enough deer encounters with 20 million miles of real world data to safely infer what a deer might do - and what your best course of action is.  So you're left with simulation trying to fill in these gaps.   But the behavior of deer is not something that WayMo's simulation engineers know....they just don't.   Sure, you could get a deer biologist ""expert"" to come in and work on that part - but do THEY even know?   I think not.   But Tesla now have somewhere around 70 BILLION miles of real-world data.  And that's going to include a thousand times more deer encounters than WayMo's dataset.  (Actually, a hell of a lot more than that because WayMo's cars only drive in city centers).   This is the fundamental flaw in WayMo's approach.  Sure, they can capture enough in-town data to build a reasonably safe car - and with only a few hundred cars on the roads, the odds of them encountering something they never saw before is small.  But when you have a few million cars driving on country roads, freeways, in tunnels, in different countries where the rules and driving customs are different - they simply CANNOT capture enough data to do the job.   So, yeah - a WayMo taxi can drive you around some small downtown area - but ask it to drive you from El Paso, Texas to Sheboygan Wisconsin  (as my Tesla recently drove me) - it's going to see VASTLY  more things than they have data for...and they can't fix that.  They'd need a million cars on the road (which WayMo can't afford) - each one covered in their sensors (which are EXPENSIVE - so they won't pursuade large car makers to install them unnecessarily for a few years before the software will work).   This is a serious problem - and I don't see how anyone other than a large car maker with the motivation to spend the money on it can possibly make this work...outside of some tiny, heavily constrained area.",1,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'Waymo']"

But you are right that the key issue is the millions upon millions of edge cases. Google is trying to fix that by driving its cars millions of miles in the road. Tesla is trying to fix that by monitoring the driving of every Tesla owner and using that as the training data for the AI. Both have pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs. It is the edge cases that are holding this technology back. In most of these edge cases the car just stops and won‚Äôt move. Well in Google‚Äôs case. So they can remote control it from the depot.
