Driverless cars won't help the middle bit that much, except if they really do have other things to do, the car will be better than them by some amount just by dint of more eyes, and unlimited object tracking. It could go either way.

Driverless cars won't be better than the top 25% of drivers, the people who drive so much and practice so much, the gamers who have been shown to have greater object tracking skills. The professional racers, who spend 10k hours tracking objects and speeds and know their car physics.

The comparison to planes is a bad one, plane pilots are supposed to be *well trained* and that pilot who put the plane in reverse on accident I'm sure was fired for gross incompetence. The average driver is *not* professionally trained, so of course the computer is going to be better than a minority of drivers, but the computer is only superior at flying a plane when the pilot would get 0 information from the outside world. The plane has gps and radar and all sorts of stuff the pilot doesn't. I completely agree that the solution is just train drivers better, and then we reduce 25% of all accidents. But as long as we allow drivers to be amateurs, then sure, driverless robot cars will be better than at least 25% of drivers.

I'm at least average, and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that 73% of people thinking they're above average is a bad thing, because only 1/3rd of those people are wrong. 50% of the population is above average, by definition, even if by a miniscule amount. When I drive by myself, with no (or few, like a good song on Pandora) distractions, I am way better of a driver than any computer could be with the same amount of data input. It's just a factor of the neural nets that make up physics prediction.

When I have other riders, or distractions, I'm no better than average, but I'm still better than the 25% at the bottom that are physically dangerous to be around.

I recently got a nice (used) Toyota sienna with laser powered cruise control, and it is the nicest cruise control I have ever had. No other car I have ever owned has been capable of performing as well, and the controls are all on a single gamer-friendly knob, instead of random buttons I have to read every time.

That said, it's from 05, it doesn't know how to do calculus to know when to stop accelerating. If it sees it is going more than 5 mph different than what you set it, it up shifts, sometimes twice, and then it'll shoot past it's target, sometimes even into detection range of another car, then slowing way down, it doesn't know how to solve for time of acceleration, it's really obvious.

But, if you get it up to the correct speed manually, it maintains that speed WAY better than a foot-powered foot ever could, so in that way, I use it as a manual throttle lock, instead of a real cruise control. I'm always attentive of it, because even with car detection, it doesn't work great driving into the sun, or driving in the rain. Additionally, on the highway it has no idea about lanes, and I have to physically pause it, or switch lanes before it tries to slow me down when I pass.

Are self driving cars better than that? Yeah, even a shitty Tesla like what electroboom has can lane switch, but it has obvious failure modes too. Maybe that's because it's not ""grade four driverless"" or whatever, but ultimately I won't ever drive a car that I can't be in control of, because the car is a tool for me to use, not a chauffeur.

Cruise is a tool. ABS is a tool. Sonar range finders are a *tool* and when driverless becomes a thing, I will still use it as a tool. Even if I don't have to have my hands on the wheel, it *will not* be better at prediction and physics than me, only at multitasking and long distance sign reading (curse my nearsighted genes!) And reactions as well, but if it hasn't identified the problem correctly then it doesn't matter if it's reaction is .0001 seconds, because I'll have to take over in .01 seconds anyway.

An average or above average driver will be better than a computer at solving for edge cases. A bottom 25% driver may as well switch to driverless in 15 years when they're actually affordable.

This is a nice video, and I wasn't aware that full driverless was actually this advanced, I was still under the impression it was at grade 3 or lower, but when people said the technology is 10 years away they weren't wrong.

Richard Branson went to space, it'll be 50 years before I can afford it. it'll be 10 before you can afford it.

Self driving cars (or even electric) will be 10 years before they're common in the market, and 30 before they're affordable.

I really want a cybertruck. But do you know how much I'd have to make you afford one? It's not really feasible for most of the population. You live in a very narrow entitled slice.",0,,True,none,"['Tesla', 'BMW']"

Recently I had the pleasure to drive some new model of BMW, and was surprised how useful and reliable the lane assist was. At one point I was paying attention to construction works taking place next to the highway, and without the assist, I would have very likely veered out of the lane (reduced width due to the construction work). As these things become more common, human-caused accidents can be reduced in frequency and severity.

An interesting point are also autonomous vehicles used in airports, ports, warehouses, etc. Maybe it's a more controlled environment as compared to real traffic out there, but it works quite well already and most wouldn't bat an eye if the shuttle bus at the airport doesn't have a driver.",0,,True,none,['BMW']

I think it makes sense on interstates, like what chevy has for their super cruise- interstates are long, gently curving roads with no cross traffic and generally physical barriers of some kind separating oncoming traffic. But on city streets? Absolutely not, and anybody trying to tell you they're better than human drivers is selling you something, or at the very least, really do not know enough about the tech and are buying the marketing hype. At the very least, if a self driving car is on the road, I would expect it to prioritize the rider's life last over everybody else- if somebody steps out onto the road, that thing better drive itself into a wall rather than run somebody down, or else every single engineer at Waymo should be tried for murder. That's the risk you should accept when you get into one of these things.

""the only safe way to proceed is with a car with at least level 4 autonomy"" and who exactly decides that? waymo? do you really trust silicon valley to keep pedestrians safe?

Not that human drivers are, uh, particularly good, but the technology is *absolutely not there* to replace humans yet. Nowhere NEAR. Autonomous cars also won't solve traffic or help the environment or generally make cities nicer, safer places to live- what we need is to just build some dang trains and bike lanes.

anyways. just generally sucks to see you making some obvious propaganda for wildly unsafe and socially terrible experimental technology which will absolutely result in even more unnecessary deaths on the road. All you would be doing by switching to autonomous car is laundering the human error so that nobody has liability when a Waymo car plows directly into a toddler or drives you directly into a wall because it was painted just the wrong color or something. I just think this is a tremendously irresponsible video, presenting a lot of- at best- terminally car-brained futurism, or at worst, just repeating marketing points that Waymo fed you.
