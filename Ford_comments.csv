We must be careful in how we measure performance as to not be biased.
8:40 You say that it's impossible for a machine to make a human error -- well of course, this is by definition that only a human can make a human error.
10:05 You say it can detect a stop sign or pedestrian 500 meters away -- this is a biased way of measuring performance because it's a strict comparison of detection mechanisms (eyes vs. cameras/radar).

I can say AI driven cars would solve many problems like drunk driving, elderly drivers who probably shouldn't drive but have to, and I think in time it can help greatly with traffic congestion. But let's not overlook the problems it creates: expense of ownership, general reliability, 'software' or 'programming errors' can result in any kind of response (compared to humans which almost universally respond to driving issues w/ braking), AI might just as well do the opposite, hence I'd expect fatalities to be less frequent, but involve more people when they occur.

I can't help but recall my office mate in my PhD program who took his Ford truck to the dealership when his A/C stopped working. They told him it needed a software update. I do not want the machine I drive to work to be capable of failure due to a software update. My truck has an ECU for the fuel injection, but that's it and that's enough. I installed my own infotainment center running Android on a touchscreen, but the car itself is dumb as rocks.... 14 years and counting I've only had one (1) 50K mile scheduled maintenance, oil changes, 1 set of new tires, and 3 lead acid battery changes, and 3 or 4 new windshield wipers installed...

We cannot move forward with this technology if ""ignore the edge cases, those are rare"" is the mindset of the people in charge of it. I sincerely hope that is you injecting your viewpoint onto it and that's not coming from Waymo.

The clip you showed of someone arguing an edge case where it encourages people not to wear helmets is not invalidated by its rareness. People don't act based on statistics. If they did, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in right now in 2021. We don't need to stop pushing autonomous vehicles forward for this helmet question (the system is nowhere near capable enough of accurately identifying safety equipment and making decisions based on it so it's not a relevant question) but other questions DO need to be addressed.

Let me give you a perspective that is a bit more worrying to me. Twice in the past few months we've seen a huge swath of the internet go offline for a few hours when a major cloud host went down. First Google, then Amazon. It's been a wakeup call to some that we've overcentralized our online infrastructure, but others are ignoring it...because of course they are. Just last week we had a zero day where all Apache servers (the most common web server software). The concern with automated driving is it potentially creates a very deadly single point of failure. I don't see that happening with Waymo's current fleet as they are largely autonomous and, importantly, nowhere near the most common vehicle on the road. But let's fast forward to when an automated system controlling vehicles is as common as Toyota vehicles. There are three major issues that need to be clearly addressed before many of us will trust allowing them to grow towards that point.
1. Does it stop working if some external service goes offline - GPS, internet, a server in Toyota's basement, whatever. Obviously, given a certain country it's being developed in, it can currently stand to be without internet for a while because American internet, but we can't get ourselves dependent on a transportation technology that stops functioning entirely if an online service goes down. A smartbulb that won't work anymore because the server discontinued is a small inconvenience, but if Ford goes under and shuts off servers their vehicles depend on, that can result in a lot of slow and painful deaths. 
2. Can the fleet be compromised. The talk of cars that communicate with each other sounds great...unless you work in computing. Then it sounds like someone forgot bad people exist. That sort of inter-connectivity is like handing the nuclear codes to anyone who figures out or is told how to send commands to those cars. If someone figured out how to send the command to accelerate over that communications system (which, even if the communications system doesn't convey commands is still possible) then millions could die within hours.
3. Can individual cars be attacked. For a while, many banks and credit card companies were putting wireless chips in cards and insisting it was ""safe"". Security experts demonstrated a small loop of wire that could fit in someone's pocket, along with a small control device could pull all the needed information off the cards from a distance and reproduce it on demand. Now those chips aren't in most cards anymore. A few manufacturers are desperately claiming theirs are ""safe"" but few are gullible enough to believe them now. This one is going to have to be demonstrated, not merely assured. Something like letting a few hacker conventions have at the vehicle on a closed course where they won't have any qualms about making it do things that would otherwise be lethal. This one is more for avoiding unnecessary roadblocks. We don't want car manufacturers to get gunshy about automated software like banks did with the card chips. Yes, you can get people to quickly trust the car to drive, but it can just as quickly generate distrust and outrage if one person gets killed because a malicious individual tricked the vehicle into doing something wrong. You would also need to test against large scale shutdown attacks such as saturating an area with the right frequency of light that the LIDAR is using or painting something with a material that scatters or absorbs that light.

Saving lives is a good goal, but if you leave the door open to losing more lives, or if you rush forward so fast that you stumble and slow down the process, then you've done a disservice. Being better than what we have now isn't good enough. We have to work through the ramifications of it to avoid unintended consequences.

Many years ago, people worked out that putting lead in gasoline would solve a major problem. And an entire generation got lead poisoning from that. Unintended consequences can be disastrous beyond your wildest dreams, especially for something as ubiquitous as transportation. We need this technology to succeed, not be held back by early failures that could have been anticipated if we had listened to the people we thought were just naysayers.",16,,True,none,"['Ford', 'Waymo']"

A lot of her time is wasted going to the start point of public transport, switching public transport and from end point to final destination. However, this technology is only viable if it's truly autonomous 100% of the time. That means not only must it be able to navigate all kinds of obstacles like roadworks and accidents, but also all kinds of weather. (Rain still seems to be a problem for Waymo sensory systems.) A lot of road infrastructure has to be either changed or augmented to accommodate these vehicles. For example traffic regulatory systems (traffic lights, speed signs, etc) need some way of communicating with the vehicle as well as communication between vehicles. Also for better or worse a lot of legislation has to be done. (It took literally centuries to come up with road rules.) And we as a society have to accept that small and major accidents will happen. I also imagine that ""car ownership"" is going to be an issue. It looks that Tesla bets that cars will be still owned by the majority of individuals, while the rest (Alphabet, Ford, etc) assumes that a ""car as a service"" is the more likely outcome. I can imagine that we might not even have individual cars in the future, but something that is a hybrid between car, bus and train.

3. Humans can decide to ignore rules in an emergency - machines cannot decide to ignore rules. Eg. here in Denmark any car can be turned into an emergency ambulance and can violate speed limits etc. at the responsibility of the driver.
4. I like my privacy - I know its hard enough allready to get a car that wont record where the car is at what time, how fast it is driving etc. now because off all those stupid gadgets people seem to crave, but how can I trust the maker of an autonomous car to respect my privacy any more than all the other makers of devices for the ""internet of things"" that so far are happy to spy on us to give us a better customer experience.
5. Hacking Similar to 4. Any device capabable of communicating can be hacked and corrupted - eg. someone might make all Ford cars in NYC refuse to move - imagine the chaos. or eg. Imagine someone ordering your car to go to a location different than the one you intended to go to and locks the car.

Second I bet it can't handle farm country roads. I also hate the idea all travel times are locked in. The car don't know how to drive around a tractor. One usually has to drive against traffic to pass tractors. Most importantly...driving is fun and I usually insist on being the driver. I don't enjoy riding as a passenger. I also worry about hate drivers. The ones who will deliberately try to make one of these things crash. It happens to Teslas often.,0,,True,none,['Ford']
