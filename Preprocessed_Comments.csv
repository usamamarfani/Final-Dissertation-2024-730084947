thehopelessgeek thing definitely improve next year think trend lead job think cant replaced know one job wont time soon
im digging driverless car saying
people didnt dig mobile phone either first complaining bad battery life bulky design early day even famous research company like mckinsey grossly underestimated popular would today
thehopelessgeek well diffrent though liked phone came hanged easy commicate friend family dont like actually negative distracted people came result driverless car change society worst wait see freedom start declining fast

condom dispenser etc
yellow called yellow light
good example perplexing tesla removed sensor trying implement full self driving honestly think tesla would waayyy along kept additional sensor
really perplexing tesla couldnt afford mass produced car hence elon wanted move away shitting lidar process save face waymo make work bc google owning financing whatever need
extra sensor give illusion progress tesla offer far advantage long run seeing v would say tesla set dominate space
thewatcher yikes easy copium pal
andresacosta copium required following self driving year waymo impressive tech tesla holding ace said tesla set dominate space seeing
thewatcher doesnt make senseat literally point even dramatically improve thing camera adding sensor make even better mean every competitor us sensor going automatically ahead unless make serious misstep
need heavy good vehicle driver get point speeding
stop ad bring back lew later

think thing beautiful useful technical development term speed completing task think disadvantage communication human society decrease
lmfao bought paid bruh ass compared tesla inside car look like every car bought paid bruh content used lot better
autonomous cab dont buy whole car point
company chose jaguar automated vehicle
imagine someone trying steal driverless car stop red light
constantly learning improving fact buzzword ai engineer really doubt advanced capable usually ai model would retrained today reality learning live data driving market would challenging also could create accident
lost light turning amber
car selfdriving would assume could go much faster snooze back dont think im flying even take longer get car house get destination
amber hell call yellow light amber sure drive still lew
someone jump front passenger seat drop u realize someone got pull right
overtake
happens passenger start messing around steering wheel
cant wait tech becomes norm like futuristic vehicle see movie
yup
thats car could drive anywhere else premapped city tesla drive anywhere
police want pull happens someone us waymo getaway driver crime
never happen siren go waymo go side road screen say yielding emergency vehicle wan na get caught real fast advise use waymo lol also cant touch steering wheel car might brake hard pull immediately
gon na address temu controversy endorsing promoting buying chinese slave labor knock product oh ok
people stop drinking learn drive thats
live tempephoenix driving around probably year still weird see every day
hate lew later
la hazyboy
cool assume cost ride similar uber taxi key feature would certainly sensing viewing make better human right
need lot cheaper driver getting paid
actually need recoup investiment cost bigbadjerryrogers
bigbadjerryrogersall rd get cheaper next decade
tallacus next decade late
finally youre something lazy canadian
seatbelt would take car
someone cover cameraslidarsensors waymo vehicle would blind operation
run red light
nope got already intersection red
ofc alphabet owns
az
trip downtown cost year day please deposit time
hope los angeleans nicer waymo san franciscan recently
think cant nice thing meme also people los angeles often referred angelenos
waymo truly redefined game groundbreaking technology
omg love wish came uk
eauuu jaguar though even knew still company self driving seems work well
way better tesla course
way tesla huge advantage set dominate space
take snow storm
run india without accident run anywhere world
man crazy
first time ive heard somebody call yellow traffic light amber
""
really american thing always amber
ettcha im europe never say amber yellow
ettcha also europe googling bit seems amber mostly uk thing america call yellow
cool gotten much better demo watched long ago
ive ridden wayne phoenix lot time every time drive always smooth without issue prefer normal ubers thing take conservative route like side road also drive speed limit speed take little longer get destination normal uber
always see odd dead end street light charging waiting next passenger
chrisvela theyre probably waiting ride booked theyll sit idle parked side road instead driving around waiting ride booked conserve battery
plotting world takeoverchrisvela
completely random id love ask question interview im ux designer im thesis project master program thing
chrisvela understanding waiting next ride move section city lower concentration waymos always one nearby matter city suppose also affected ai learning detect many waymos typically needed certain area car ready near major transit center example
know la exit car instantly go soft music siren even car like yea get got ta get outta tip app
lmao
he westwood right street ucla medical center va hospital really nice expensive area ambulance cop
sounded like los santos
depends part la live la dont hear siren often
flybriur joking live miami honestly dont know geographics los angeles part california besides seen movie boy hood menace society south central etc
already driverless vehicle theyre called train
awsome ngl lol
scenario car get hacked time leave hitting wall full speed die
would react emergency vehicle coming behind
im assuming would automatically pull
worked great san fran
see good cause doesnt consciousness human error still might error thats calculated error
youre going worry speeding running someone rush
music option great stuff
haha agree love lews view technology like somewhat creepy
liam giving sinister vibe thats sure lol like something ominous whats come near future
ive ridden waymo twice phoenix ride amazing like said video smooth handled situation well issue like experienced became comfortable within minute ride starting first waymo ride nervous excited time experiencing waymo nervous feeling went away definitely use waymo hopefully many time
price compared like taxi uber
letteralex comparable weekend pricing second ride week day
traffic official who license require
hell like chat driver
dream id rather take chance programming moron road texas god people cant drive
isnt new phoenix year
would car stop one getting ride reach steering wheel
mindblowing experience love
thats nominal condition collision happens road weather isnt favorable sensor like fog rain snow
equipped lidar addition optical sensor see obstruction road avoid reroute programming permit apparently camera unit infrared capability night time isnt big issue radar also equipped would still greater awareness human would bad condition
drive rainfog there many video driving rain also collision happens reroute take different way might go close collision see cant go immediately try turn around leave area
happens police wat pull car someone us waymo get away driver
experienced waymo phoenix agree ride smooth also cost similar lyft uber cheaper even since dont need tip
well safely use able navigate dangerous road world safely
waymo san francisco smooth id always pick waymo available area im traveling
much cheaper since dont pay human driver get keep precedings impressed
leb casual broke person taking account tech involved maintenance tech brokey
leb broke people gross eww
buy merchandise endorsed great putin
ask put seatbelt
china driverless taxi since last year
drive uyghurs reeducation camp
lmao perfect timing
main reason better driver human driver distraction ever
distraction literal degree vision doesnt check blind spot see
well actually make nice ghost driving scene horror movie lol
could possibly go wrong
drive next every day
thesis domain
mani really miss lew later
interesting cool expected
frustrating focusing self driving car dont sufficient self driving bus rail
az
know could sit driver seat waymo auto drive keep going going place wanted go thing could thing
waymo perfect example lidar sensor increase safety reliability elon need take note camera future
cheaper without driver
god theyll make profit employ le people
looking waymo youtube seeing video yesterday waymo car set fire
lol yea kinda stupid attack car tho since like k camera im pretty sure identify every person probably wont would make people hate waymo much
didnt torch one cali
automatise everything made everyone educated basic satisfied time world dedicate art would wonderful many door open brain
tesla dont sensor waymo never able
tesla sensor waymo actually huge advantage seeing v tesla set dominate space
crazy use apple vision pro
couple sex ride
got ta see responds bad driver road
jaguar waymo thats
future look crap wan na go back past
sat seatbelt oh gosh im scared
lolz imagine driver behind car wouldnt break
test toronto winter middle snow storm true test
waymo already drive rain focusing driving highway maybe theyll focus driving snow
rich
yellow dude amber isnt rainbow color
lew impressive technology guess flaw idiot driving vehicle might attempt cheer rik spector
even remotely accuratedriverless car extremely flawed currently
ive seen video waymo cant deal broken car lane think stopped car wait till support guy call
bunsterthats exactly happensnot mention incapable maneuvering around road work well
ronjones ye technology yet car using ai need work situation see drive deal learn deal itsself thats tech isnt public yet still learning exposure ai enough dataset probably get normal car aswell tho probs gon hella expensive first
eliteiel thing even training road ever evolving day day basiscant really train ai model data set effectively forever changing
wheres podcast miss listening vids massive decline think step away spotlight man
wonder far ahead well could anticipate red light runner reacts
think old veritasium vid
b want see surviving month new york city
surely isnt legal guy made jail could kill anyone
great car scream beep beep motherf
automotive hvac engineer view upcoming autonomous fleet car every ride driverless uber experience meaning customizable aspect car would also autonomous including thermal comfort anyone suggest feature domain would futuristic unique
owned car driverless would cool get car take school take work dont care anything else date sit together back talk one need pay attention traffic
ubers gon na pissed
uber invested billion self driving car would rather driverless fleet pay human filthy human
feeling uber lyft either acquired waymo create kind deal license car use help defray cost scaling city regular taxi car owner paid thousand dollar medalions thinking would never lose value may even owe money financing purchase medalions several probably find value medalions become alot le valuable
million yes million driver depend uber lyft make living gon na pissed
syberpunk think message passed uber lyft driver driving car taxi like driver temporary situation looking kind job longer job prospect understand waymo hiring industry grows robo taxi road support role human waymo perhaps company provide robo taxi
think one first start driverless taxi uber lyft
literally broke signal
past light turned red normal driver would done
probably wise decision since hard breaking may ended crash car behind
dont think like cybertruck would pas european uk pedestrian safety law
awesome
ah car got destroyed yesterday
question takeover control
""
get understand ive ready happen wild af see action like
happened year ago operating phoenix since
yea man tempe year yet take ride one maybe soon
complain buckled
min destination bet done min
back took waymo little brother car got stuck moment trying merge right lane lane turn walmart parking lot well car bit shouldve waymo sat moment also noticed barely made left turn kept taking right turn avoid left left took neighborhood
year later mile record im sure take lot initiative make left turn route like shown
kyefullwood dont doubt sharing experience
kyefullwood yea look old video waymo driving way passive jaguar came driving get little aggressive like seen waymos overtake people youtube drive speed limit old car would never
unprotected left heavy traffic cant see opposite lane car hard enough human rather take detour instead risking crash
control speed limit locked speed thing
thats amazing car time come india
amazing cant wait see evolve within next year
absolutely le human interaction progressive become society love
last generation drive gas car probably next would last ever see car require driver
gankster good point
next five year like bird plane flying car
johnnymichael isnt way around
ive nightmare like
waymo cooler tesla
fact
waymo drive highway operating limited area citiespennytrui
way seeing v tesla set dominate space
thewatcher well tesla doesnt handle situation well yet imo run trouble way often plus google imagine like year car come sensor packed nicer way like app running car dont think tesla distribute software im sure heck google would right price ofc ahaha
eliteiel seeing tesla handling thing far better waymo remember waymo operating limited structured way tesla fsd limitation far go meaning deal far diverse set driving skill fsd ready making basic error driving human like manage situation even complex one little issue tesla make fsd work cheapest scalable solution automation something waymo simply compete
imagine pulling hood
hell mean
happens im cased another car gunman dealing road rage
car go defense mode turn giant transformer
thats cool
there one command car go
lol china year ago
need apple vision pro future hear lol
driverless car look like without elons b
seeing v tesla fsd comment age well
aka san fran molotov cocktail
new york rush hour car aint surviving
aweisenexactly one day traffic always constant flow
introducing car city cause traffic matter best way go transportation public transit like rail busing car hold people max bus hold people take le space equivalent car let alone rail significant efficient due low friction rail aweisen
actually waymo ask start testing manhattan however governor denied concern taxi driver job gon na test upstate ny instead
scream cyberpunk
delamain

frustrating legally drive around driver yet let tesla drive autonomously im working phone laptop could still get ticket cop argument need pay attention road even though there one physically driving autonomous system supposed attentive fair

investor mean asked make money answered futuristic b groomed growing favorite tv show
nobody asked today uber lyft giving people ride every day problem human driver faster safer primitive taxi computer
im asking saw difficult grandmother give independence able drive driving five year longer really could safely hoping selfdriving car would ready prime time parent reached point appears unlikely theyre saying least another year selfdriving car sold commercially time parent older grandmother stopped driving however still hopeful time old drive selfdriving car available even brother life eight driving hour away would convenient could finish work friday eat dinner pack car start driving place recline chair go sleep knowing wake driveway next morning
redpanda never get zero accident million people driving every day strange thing happen time time law physic unforgiving time selfdriving car able eliminate accident caused driver error vast majority
jeremykraenzlein forgetting one minor detail le one percent car america telsas fsd work properly selfdriving broken instead supervised driving fsd going help elderly people
hate driving passion still dont trust automated car thank
even want future
type thing one ever asked necessity car drive progress whole new set problem inconvenience reason think ever thought pay actual people drive imagine needing help road whatever reason see car passing self driving one looool
imagine world without human driver error much safer road user
build train
man cant wait see day self driving electric car perfected mean really think le idiot road le drunk driver le road rage le attempted murder running someone overall le distraction safety pedestrian
car got accident bad enough car started fire since auto lock electric lock day someone gon na escape door wont unlock
believe trust technology invented made human despite knowledge still bound err technology put take place human driversis caterstrophichow many going loose job many invention threat human existence survival encouraged like invention production weapon mass destruction otherwise care caution takenthe human race bring total destruction allowing devil use ownselves achieve aim destroying man kind thanks
rushing implement technology need roundabout way ignore affect damaged human condition caused people control society
oki get concern concern here something else technology came long way everybody else blind driverless car everybody see people drive thats need people taking sighted people taking stuff blind meeting using everybody think quit making thing blind everybody else including dont know cell phone also blind would cane everybody else smartphones supposed strictly blind everybodys like oh thats cool wont became normal people thats b know know thats way cookie crumbles blind people get short interesting stick deaf people get ever thought getting blind people dont get well cant see anyway annoying people need start stuff blind guess im visually impaired cant normal people want lazy
oh soon install ai driver wait thats wuold scarery car thats fly
driverless car ready hit road full time yah think
create balistic transport xd ai would great calculating least xd
edit dude doesnt put mile instead kilometer vice versa xd
im biggest champion selfdriving car think way much conversation sensational rather inquisitive informative easy enough find silly situation ridicule dont think news reporting getting age well rate thing developing seems likely selfdriving car safer average human driver relatively soon considered safe enough operate learn live environment evolve even faster shouldnt let company get away murder doesnt seem like trying seems like trying best somewhat dismissive sometimes outright hostile medium environment progress inevitable case selfdriving car perhaps mostly better least take seriously enough prepare probably much need human driver future important stick head sand pretend isnt going happen look history automation though likely way play something like yesterday mean selfdriving car dont silly total science fiction never actually happen today look silly autonomous car drive well human time sometimes stop apparent reason hilarious tomorrow stop selfdriving car massively outperforming human driver cant compete losing job isnt fair
think worth noting problem solving right quantitative time isnt helpful im even ultracapitalist reminds people think could good ceo ceo job attended dinner reading platitude corporate pr meeting true remaining ceo time make break company mind mean ceo ultralong workhours waking complete b made ceobot replicate wouldnt even close actually replicating ceo also there general issue fact many problem selfdriving car claim solve either solved automation would much better solved thing decent public transit traffic nonpsychotic urban design getting around generally safer vehicle engineering murdering pedestrian
blazeselfdriving car dont perfect lot better human driver give lot leaway make mistake even deadly one still net lifesaver also see selfdriving car make mistake learn update programming process much easier retraining million human driver cause selfdriving car keep getting safer time go
jeremykraenzlein true course tailend event dreaded time important hardest cover ai ai almost certainly already superhuman certain scenario missing event bad event heavily determining safety pretty crappy driver driving straight empty road imbecile cut good
blaze million car road every day much easily able see exactly cause problem case even case work fix know painful process people die accident come rare case rare show limited realworld autonomous driving happens today reduction human error crash especially account fatigued drunk distracted driver quickly enough make huge net lifesaver
nah cant make buy one
hitting road pole people pet traffic nerve

keep hearing waymo cruise still think muskmobiles ultimately win race waymo cruise still trying automate driving tesla aiming toward autonomous operation happen cab ubers even bus tram many venue trouble
year muskrat promised fsd next year he full sheet tesla system inferior system doesnt use radar lidar way set system never work
heavy russian accent capitalist west car drive
thought already oh wait thats uninsured unlicensed driver car like one keep hitting relative
buy car youre going drive take bus uber buy car buy sport car small car get mini van something allows take nap something
probably wont buying selfdriving car youll probably subscribing privately operated transit network
bradisbell correct purchase self driving car
fact crash past five year actually quite impressive considering well first year indicates significant improvement safety moreover many early incident fault autonomous vehicle rather involved driver colliding even deliberately targeting
know car actually driving actually remote controlled someone nearby location using camera lidar system
cruise car hit fire truck way put fire san francisco nothing situation impressive particularly people trapped inside burning building neighbor watching horrified street fireman trying contact cruise calling backup firehouse help put fire couldnt get illconceived prematurely released machine
l introduction robotaxis san francisco contributing enhanced safety city additionally noteworthy issue ordinary driver often unintentionally block path emergency vehicle like fire truck although issue isnt covered news report car first introduced concern uncontrolled driving necessitating safety person walk front still go control think limit speed km car driver dont see let drive strees
want advanced self driving car im stupid know ready reason long story ill put short simple amaxophobia maybe still family wont teach drive
self driving car see emergency tape plow activate finish mode
fad come pas people choose give control thing
underestimate human available going anywhere lot stupid lazy driver keep demand
thank
self driving car look boring prefer driving accident cop tellls stop car going stop hand gesture officer many problem
u either need agi rebuilt highway av mind
regulation destroy america china dominate technology
let china never buying one
never work nyc hope never bring thats taking job away way kink see mention nyc street always construction thank
get behind payment car drive back dealership hahaha
anything prevents human being operating motor vehicle fantastic
keep dreaming
make separate infrastructure self driving car maximum efficiency safety fellow driver might understand self driving car think work might pull public road could see separate infrastructure especially self driving truck carrying freight good near future dont put self driving car human driver best separated also depends using downtown area much harder use v normal suburb mostly straight road
week cone
basically reinvented train
future dont know people selfdriving car maybe use self driving taxi use selfdriving taxi maybe selfdriving car better job human driver people die injured time human driver dont think happen selfdriving car suggested point future might law person drive car maybe thats ok would rather selfdriving car road human jerk drunk idiot road
ok stupid cant even get gun ban
car gotten crash per yearor crash per month car got le accident per month lot better human driver report many crash human driven car gotten five year
five year old guy wont believe grandpa car actually drive himselfyeah car doesnt driving grandpa actually hold big circle guide car
futuristic nonsense like boy comic used read year ago nonsense finance good job industry little else
julianbiggsso think fifty year wont complete self driving car
five year old grandpa said kid actually thought car actually drive day lived insane period billion dollar quite lot time poured self driving car got close never actually managed make car good enough unmonitored autonomous driving grandpa said brick wall final level computer great tool replace human consciousness finally found worth bother
te technology level yet

driving city bus driverless waymo van made left turn without enough room almost collided van would injured passenger guy really need work kink
use technology sell software car company advanced driving assistance expensive robotaxis fleet many cost around keeping running would need charge customer double uber lyft charge
think maintenance car cost full time employee alot cheeper long run
would think testing would make someone still sit driver seat extra safety ready turn autodriving take wheel themselvesat least testing period one thing company care safety far reputation concerned
car drive better human soon theyre planning future driver needed
educated youd know telsa testing exact way half decade building fully autonomous every level driving tested improve software safety priority else would even build self driving

almost joined cruise software engineer year ago thing long road ahead safe trusted best solution moment driverless road road digital infrastructure sensor would help driverless car make decision
yep sensor top view street camera central cloud processing real time data link feed integrated system similar u military like car would know th car ahead going make right turn preemptively slows
road designed car called freeway
best solution since building driverlessonly road prohibitively expensive even city room might well take bus since youd walk road walk destination sensor needed would much le expensive install existing telephone light pole

got recommended video watching video bunch waymo taxi stuck loop honking parking lot night also right quick google search finding waymo successfully sued california dmv hiding accident record involving waymo car public theyve bought veritasium yet money would x better served upgrading public transit infrastructure ie train bus get pissed away robotaxis elite hail google autonomous overlord
say hitting person reversing impossible car yet run people problem driver blame put individual people car cause crash inevitably assigning responsibility difficult yeah trust human recognize another human obstacle much algorithm probabilistic machine learning prone misunderstanding precisely true understanding threedimensional space around im autonomous driving would much rather see directed centrally giving every single car image analysis software run underpowered system positioning system every car broadcast position including one autonomous least sensor relying purely camera tesla crazy
usually think veritasium video excellent self driving car going fix traffic theyre way avoid facing truth car dependency
fact rely lidar good wan na see behave rainy day lidar perform worse camera perform well
beware video science education minute advert waymo paid waymo containing really misleading statistic omission
im still waiting
well produced presented video question better place electric monorail replace street infrastructure street created driver car driver however surely track even safer street driverless society looking replace car infrastructure created car understand expense actually driverless car take larger capability passenger well small capability virtually cost frequency infrastructure built super sized monorail vehicle would safer financially viable spead vehicle could increased also thereby reducing travel time problem automated system power failure issue software ect still think based program automated driving system safer mixed system best argument see u million hour experience worst argument software full control need stop button key people order override emergency software bug software issue might occur

despise idea full automated self driving car one question anyone think good idea technology ever bought computer freeze hang certainly never bought one despite fact usually buy top line computer end failing invariably happens office arme done happens killing speed youre kind screwed plane go every direction left right car option plane flying thousand foot usually cross anything solid path sky verry different place city street
idea video thinking photographic memory different state mind caused dream would really like see video
computer absolutely perfectly faultless nooooo fn way im letting one drive kid around driver even without driver take simple glitch lag n u n possibly innocent ppl around u wont ever get let ur kid mom dad know u love yes obviously human driver r also far perfect simply feel better control n least chance avoiding killing somebody poor thing let alone
computer fact perfect thing perfect code ai whatever tool computer using think good measure even risk crashing risk still lot lower human driver trust computer driving lot human
sirwaffly well gate still leak n corrosion still happens n cause short along tin whisker n manufacturing isnt perfect defect happen etc unfortunately even hardware isnt perfect yea agree problem definitely code physical system car also agree thing safer there computer driving especially get point theyre communicating certain proximity n know others intention r accident almost certainly b dramatically decreased imagine itll also improve bad traffic
guy think computer perfect flawless isnt one
roelsvideosandstuffs computer fail due external factor core breaking memory breaking corrosion high temperature etc theory perfect good condition fail much le human
sirwaffly still arent perfect cant perfect computer

propaganda lmfao
bro read title commented watch video bruh
aged poorly thought sealed ready go also fact tried sue cali cover crash data every month go pr video put black mark reputation hope cash worth
awful video dangerous propaganda push everyone know driverless car awful dont work wont work kill people public transit better option id recommend transit urbanism channel expert agrees premise video simply ad science marketing
see least problem unless solved today current road infrastructure unless sufficient paint road something pasted road ai read would difficult vehicle stay lane town city cant keep repair resurface well traveled road road marking refreshed well missing night lane marker stop sign blocked brush tree traffic light burn speed limit sign defaced missing ai driven vehicle share road driven people dont drive defensively break every traffic law distracted bad aggressive driving habit generally ai kind defensive driving champ navigate issue sign probably left issue think ive made point perhaps advantage ai wouldnt use cell phone driving
engineer cool think need walkable city car even driverless
make bike friendly talking
wow airplane able auto land diffrence airplane dont need deal traffic execute movement want whenever want traffic
also worth knowing eye like dozen people process onboard airport triple checking every tiny step way making sure every involved component plane landing strip working properly airstrip multiple device give plane vital information one error malfunction autoland aborted immediately aint magic autopilot use time lastresort employed condition make regular landing arent possible

basically paid advertisement le likely watch veritasiums video
bias video ignores negative point subject care long money involved eh
mabye isnt many negative point also cover downside anyway
scientific channel sponsored private company advantage using product well report immediatly
maybe autonomous mode fully functional driver seat like use would forever solution could many instance driver replaced option use regular car desired must example natural disaster war vehicle malfunction going area autonomous mode doesnt work well rough road condition like heavy snow
lovely advertisement video
pathetic deceptive commercial
human error stat really know brick laying casualty affect men also know brick layer men misleading statistic even correct

technology year away affordable
think would game changer various reason would great could reduce drunk driver
please stop making fully sponsored video undermine value credibility brand
need technology soon population
video offered yt feed im going watch look get safer human driver believe live austin become dangerous drive especially last year two drive uber dealt many many cruise vehicle last year im telling ready observation watching lot every time drive several time week also story passenger ride suddenly stop apparent reason always go green light drive bike lane bunched narrow road effectively blocking traffic includes emergency vehicle simply process problem like human would several time night like turning narrow enough avoid big truck parked corner instead one simply stopped blocking lane dont stop narrow street let another one go seen one go far right way left curb cutting human signaling last night passenger told first one drove touched handle supposed open door replacement went wrong way one way street cancelled got list go finally literally job dont want look something else gone say good riddance needed better human driver austin need dedicated traffic police force another story
disgusting shill propaganda driverless car paid driverless car
argument like driving driving car boring driveless car drive well prect every single human behaviour road
who watching video stating veritasium shilling waymo
taken embarrassment misinformation
unsubscribed sponsored content dubiously sourced freakin disappointing mate ashamed hope got ton money sold credibility educator
full disclosure video sponsored waymo ive decided swap scientific skeptic hat far valuable propaganda one get bag
benefit outweigh risk massively also know tendency people afraid skeptical showing like evolution know realize great invention start wonder havent tried time people would never trade horse car
fredeplk people skeptical new technology reasonable thing avoid talking negative time people would never trade horse car wish hadnt
rocopwnage negative name negative affect tiny minority situation
imdemonalchemist massacring dozen human ai fails detect something negative
balarog happened yeah find insanely unlikely though mention would need happen time year equal number human killed human car accident u alone
people struggling get source income driving
car accident caused human driven car really bad statistical comparison im assuming stats say accident caused self driven car caused human driven tad bit fair comparison would x total human drivev car caused accident v total self driving car caused accident
someone severe anxiety panic attack make impaired decision making driving causing unable drive cant wait thing hella expensive someday stop paying uber
instead driverless car maybe america focus making road actually safe drive butcash must flow
one people blame road accident driver supposed see adapt whatever condistions
get bus drived well net emission would le electric car public participation good
nice ad shill youre educator anymore
video basically paid advert
swear driving traffic driverless car waymo intelligent system
aged poorly
cant wait car drive trust car ppl road
already money need still go ahead take bag youve lost credibility
cool thanks
happy excited get auto car still scared get elevator
used watch video made lose faith integrity
aug npr writes selfdriving car firm want california regulator allow vehicle san francisco street police fire department cite many time autonomous vehicle botched rescue operation
one first viewer channel faithfully watched new video dropped however channel integrity mission become questionable murky said come science murky wont cut george orwell stated truth untruth clung truth even whole world mad however day age also mean might profitable apparently instance wasnt price yall willing pay day come science teaching profit serve primary motivator like naboo mighty boosh turn back yall cue appropriate music nail
august still big improvement car city
driverless autonomous vehicle tech supporting context eg vehicle street driven people uneven road conditionsdriving rulesregulations around world circumstance best scenario using tech enhancing driver experience capability including importantly road safety kinda similar human pilot flying capability enhanced hugely onboard computer assistant personally cant wait true driverless car become normalized life building elevator
future shouldnt expensive largely single occupancy vehicle driving people endpoint endpoint focused building society use public transportation
yes hackable car thats want dont think
stall randomly place block bus bike lane drive stall fire police scene
driverless car never even drive fully autonomously case driver isnt human instead silicon wafer somewhere deep inside car
solid video really car centric conclusion
would like hear update waymo
saying human error actually solve probelm autonomous car drive dame road human solve problem
man really sucking ai
automation nearly immune human error come error dont design system correctly must demand accountability organization providing autonomous vehicle service computer also cant think critically like people component road infrastructure could potentially need fundamental redesign accommodate autonomous vehicle large scale
lift driver
best part crash dont worry paying insurance
problem autonimous car always even perfect accident driving whats say bad actor sector private governmental economic wouldnt decide certain place forbiden car wont refuse drive
well possible country dare try india
every year aroud people killed u citizen dumb understand theyre living dystopia arent human error carcentric monstrosity id rather introduce communism install tram train transportation method dictatorship avoid socalled human error introducing autonomous private car maintaining carcentric dystopia
human error
driverless car feasible dont install steel wheelover steel barsand link steel chain
want train better come india provide enormous data train ai model also india one country anything happen road specially narrow road
im san francisco right would love try waymo ride unfortunately app geoblocked since europe way access service
stopped listening said video sponsored infomercial clickbait slop
youre using called geofenced prototype tested sf az general availability tech year away depending live great certain place get early version usable however
concern le ability car drive well giving privacy control autonomous car controlled independently instead network controlled would big benefit
main frame corporate level may atleast could control
skycrapter control godly earth air traffic control boil human sin sin extremist use tax money dont care much cost
use line map speed calculator uktrasound plus optical seltective moving object lane divider better human overspeed ticket le accident
sometime long trip tired driver need rest incase war defense city case terrorist use
personally feel creating better city infrastructure le emission heavy solution transport future far safer much accessible people arent rich also comparison autopilot isnt fair road far unpredictable pilot specifically trained work autopilot
year updateprogress
reason stopped watching veritasium paid video
think problem car bad road bad weather condition dense rain sensor probably fail anyhow think future
driverless car use horn courtesy honk warning honk
solid nonsense antitransit propaganda im disappointed still problem solved already transit walkable bikefriendly infrastructure wanting driverless car many problem car already kill enough people daily derek really still
public transit usually bad longer distance
cosmicsvids guy train
ryanbreaker yes one want lay rail everywhere unlike road would still good car
cosmicsvids wait learn usa canada built
cosmicsvids ever heard bullet train
sponsored video thank almost refrences viseo sponsored company derek tried car almost analogy airplane absolutely wrong statistic used video sound dubious backing ride derek took isnt explained pre planned overall total grade c lacking integrity accept completely money owned piece sometimes need get bag
trying take car road
would like technology get better better remove human driver road much safer
video wanted self driving car bit nervous might mess think save million life making norm also pedestrian walk straight car never mind walked straight pole reading map disney
car programmed stop
imagine taking permit test waiting month take driver test get license buy driverless car
driverless f bad
need ban human driving car soon possible dangerous human simply stupid drive safely even worse actually choose commit crime speeding also extremely aggressive driving aggravates insane level rage
upgraded public transport car
rename channel mendacium becoming much fiction reality video become infomercial sad
ad getting insane
someday carjacking would thing past carjacker get locked steeringless car would epitome crime fails
train train car
good luck cybersecurity expert
awesome video usual keep rocking
normal thing
veritasium im sorry say possible people better average driver math work well bad driver really bad thankfully many
wouldnt mind driverless car like control large machine fundamentally complicated chaotic situation like road would need build trust people sort thing butand anything possible
need charge automatically electric broken like transmission fails
would lazer beam hurt person eye
im excited im legally blind
year later talking son control car year ago son hell
great video feel ad throughout video tho
ad video whole video ad prove everyone driverless car safe let invite independent expert journalist nooooo better buy blogger million follower dont understand anything safety let tell cool safe course wont mention description video im waymo ambassador look like normal sciencetech video everyone course use data statistic provided waymo well done derek talent use trust million follower make money
train already everything driverless car claim better
dont go door
car aint future full stop weve designed community around instead people late rectify shortsightedness
shame lost credibility
nice job shilling
oh wow video propaganda
point id like make human being incapable much anything without training level training average driver received year driven bad habit occur yet average driver get tested basic level lifetime expecting proficient driver unrealistic technology requires good design construction regular maintenance advanced technology critical maintenance becomes yet average car doesnt get regular oil change expect selfdriving car properly maintained due increased level computer technology semitrucks truckstops shop find difficult find qualified technician work vehicle like million selfdriving car road test vehicle representative production vehicle future corporation take dangerous shortcut use substandard part minimize cost maximize profit reliable technology would appear data manipulated minimal driver training achieve poor human driver result would want operation doctor level training would encourage everyone skeptical data claim coming either side selfdriving car debate rather look big picture decide
think idea super cool im thinking work exactly like uber request share one people save money maybe driving suck especially u half car eliminated could reduce massive parking lot build better
kind ironic arent sure trust computerized car everything else thats computerized trust life
lazy drive car dont deserve one put damn phone away pay attention road drive learn proper driving skill uberlyfttaxi better choice drive due sight impairment
would better improve public mass transport whose efficiency accident stats order magnitude better automobile whether driven human ai even develop car pooling put human space car occupies car idle day sure lot people need transport much time day mass transport efficient safer solution ai driver
isnt weimo self drive car still work progress like hand signal turn construction sign diversion etc car road u showing much u paid say half truth
lost subscriber due video
sign k subscriber see course research anyone come opinion waymo suck also difficult achieve selfdriving much money company save removing driver balanced extra money cost
long car mode transportation alright driverless car
driver getting worse sure new generation little skilled
wait remove parking lot mean car road either drop pick person increase traffic instead car parked driver work driving make sense
driver le car coms india get fully bullied indian due legendary driving skill
scratched tesla day ago decided get rid lidar indicate stone simply see anywhere never buy car without lidar tesla strictly forbidden
wow minute ad
ready get one
let get driverless car let driverless car accelerate together let put steel car better guide let make car able carry people oh wait train bad
shill
love video science youtuber propaganda using scientific reputation please better
nice corporate ad still better walkable city robust public trandport
thank stay safe
car running police
may year ago still feel need say car way hell would ever buy drive ride even sit one
happens john doe play police siren loudspeaker forcing vehicle side road
wonder human purpose everything becomes automated happen society receive standy income passive live life system supposed live kind life dont feel useful cuz robot year ahead seems like question becomes little scary isnt feel like people already kinda feel dont wan na hard work nowadays feel like distracted tiktok consume everything arent seek reality really feel matrix look like one u already stuck really show
craziest thing video people think average driver
advertisment
wanted driverless car always lazy bastard dont wont finish developing
doesnt make sense driverless car mean whole point car drive enjoy experience also take blame involved accident driver wasnt driving
imagine many employee autonomous car company need call driver center steering car around remotely
forget blind people take cab order special uber service going way convenient autonomous car wont able communicate
u police lose much money pulling fokes anymore
ive bought tesla couple week ago autopilot amazing feel much safer high speed car control rather mindfck
tesla autopilot still considered level
sound like something wrong tbh new driver aware risk drive wouldnt say im feeling unsafe
someone throw taxi often cleaned need help bag im disabled need assistance im child like open door trip wondering loud
see happens inside car someone puke call back someone need help special thing helper assistant assigned specific car ride
banger still need people le lol
disastrousmacaron yup
disastrousmacaron thats kinda like development society work throughout history job often better need le people job
steal selfdriving car need hack system instead physically stealing im guessing impossible
personally feel like driverless car fully adopted im still unsure thats unpredictable human lane full driverless car none course making stupid mistake itll super safe though add enjoy driving sad day human arent allowed drive anymore
function use fully functional driver seat kept forever many instance could needed click drive manually even people would rarely drive good coose drive
id curious see behaves place like dallas driver erratic many driving mph
autonomous driver get duo youre hammered back
thats entire point passenger drunk affect performance car

autonomous car reduce traffic death increase every human drive want thing road
soon youll get ticket driving car youre driving car
train want train
meanwhile people place public transportation please give u train bus im begging
indian say public transport like lifeline u sorry u tho
road rage
road rage would evolve eh
happen fast enough far concerned seeing lot driver constantly looking phone driving seeing trucker watching movie yeah bring
dumbest thing ive ever heard people paying attention know drive better man made machine people cause wreck due paying attention thing shouldnt doesnt make man made computer better refuse let anyone tell whats better wont catch dangerous
earth would anyone want driverless car beyond
called elevator operator still building younger day automatic elevator dont dodge elevator dont know autoland tracking il signal sent transmitter runway autoland requires significant airport infrastructure work would guess amount roadway infrastructure required make autodriving truly safe
truly safe mean essentially zero risk yeah fact riding autonomous vehicle already massively safer riding one human driver safe
yeah could set lane automatic vehicle maybe even set track reduce tire wear maybe link together better economy scale call hyperautonomous keanu reef vibranium megapods
video filled brim false claim author take issue apology
dont trust technology dont trust people technology might paranoid google facebook get hacked several time year long someone decides take control traffic city
mean crash there complex moral decision car make sound like lot
car go indian ladakh hill possible
technology dont trust driver stupid stuff dont trust weve seen crazy thing road situation maybe difficult automated system react ev auto pilot love system even tho advance system tested video
fully autonomous vehicle team human behind intervene every time something stupid work city maped perfectly
gon na happen time
dare drive india
cool would rather car road future
would much rather drive car put life hand computer
future look exciting indeed concern autonomous vehicle susceptible hacking easier assassinate high profile individual instance average person might afford better cyber security leaving vulnerable hacking think need develop law accommodate selfdriving vehicle nothing perfect law stipulate take legal liability case malfunction lead catastrophe manufacture driver case hacking happens
tesla much along waymo building generalized agi solution much data lead accelerate also infrastructure way ahead
video selfdriving car sponsored cardriving company cant wait video human race sponsored national socialist movement
allowed test public seems horribly unsafe
transportation get cheaper guarantee value go billionaire pocket wage job suffer capitalism poor socialism rich
thanks
snow rain storm
want see driverless car win rally race several time trusting
hear tell might still elevator driver topeka kansa state capital building
far human driving choice hitting helmetless rider v helmeted rider lifelong motorcyclist know many human driver would would try hit motorcyclist theyre something consider risky deserve computer dont prejudice human
make great video ruin making effectively advert filled false information really like video please dont go route taking every sponsor also opinion european dont see problem self driving car fix cant fixed good quality public transport better everyone train bus tram tonne death machine racing road without even driver
ive lane keeping assist system grandpa acura rdx jerk steering wheel hand apply brake one side vehicle try bring back lane crossed centerline road provide space cyclist autonomous vehicle intelligent enough take account able cross centerline necessary
pretty disappointed see derek rent platform like become representative semidisclosed client
people dont realise already far ai machine learning stuff like really stuff like chatgpt waking people basic level tier compared possible already done use network could act like hivemind car brain learn smarter person could ever
empty road majority follow rule would car succeed crazy traffic condition indian road happen take year doesnt company test run indian road validate technology
would really like see waymo would navigate deal poor weather condition like freezing rainicing road would also like see would deal gravel road know ab gravel good thanks video really excited
driverless car future flying car generation
disagree point ab reckon ab outperforms human braking especially gravel road
ab work gravel road drove icy snowy rainy condition year never failed edit know self driving car dont use ab right control ammount car breaking like human would varying output break except way precise human worse case scenario mimic human best breaking gravel match performance
ab gravel extends braking distance however also retains ability turn wouldnt able wheel locked gravel whether better worse depends situation situation might need shortest braking distance situation might possible avoid accident without turning away obstacle matter braking distance
charlottelanvin put average driver absolutely race car driver beat ab every time thats race car dont ab
entire video propaganda dont belive garbage
veritasium element truth corporate propaganda whats next paidfor climate denialism
wow minute ad try hide ad
wait time wont car garage want go drink friend call car pick drive home going way like taxi without driver bit gon na look like
error impossible machine make thats crazy statement use fsd tesla daily know level doesnt many sensor van every single time use make mistake would cause accident future sure still year away personally know engineer work system theyll tell thing
im pilot analogy autonomous flying merit also big flaw weather good bad computer pilot using instrument provide positional information get simply looking window though computer flying pilot still tweak setting fine tune well computer fly real time also massive system ground provide situational precision required work plane automatically land long strip ground much work going ground get plan land correctly happening plane plane line landing system ground together whole thing work plane dont dozen plane foot away moving different direction stopping starting swerving failing stop get picture plane operate extremely controlled environment human keeping separated typically mile foot car operate much complex environment many possibility tesla fsd amazing system get probably take car talking working together nearly safely plane biggest difference believe human anticipate intuit driver prepare response something happens perfectly time course driver arent paying attention impaired cant computer really react react quickly faster human dont anticipate like human get strange nonhuman reaction like slamming brake strange way right number car road attempting drive tiny human driver react strange time make weird mistake leading major problem yet also driving around phoenix nearly challenging driving around let say los angeles manhattan edge case system year away reality wide well marked street suburban phoenix system okay long way go really want driverless car road
say elon tesla get praise promise something theyve yet deliver meanwhile entire time existed found today year later telsa still rated level autonomy waymo already stopped even testing level year ago
tesla waymo system even really comparable one work pre mapped specific area bunch extremely expensive sensor work road without need premmap camera autonomy level number paper dont really represent actual capability system represents responsibility company take accident could happen word waymo stable le hard coded specific road tesla universal system issue built work road waymo win short run loose long one even year waymo still limited small area handful city simply doesnt scale
sponsored video dubious attribution potential benefit like congestion storage statistic provided without source really like video faith objectivity diminished shrug announce sponsored video predict selling gif using frame
skeptical heard there lot antitesla sentiment internet believe google paid make selfserving video car ability drive city mention tesla thing city shame usual money eh
personally im excited autonomous car start causing major traffic jam jumping street randomly placing random object street
one first video watched veritasium video didnt watch anymore two year figured someone promoting self driving car sponsored self driving car company nothing say worth listening still take anything say video seriously much enjoyed many video produced
would case hidden fact video sponsored probably reached credibility tested car made observation honest one like car suddenly stop protect pedestrian dont understands would make anyone else question integrity ad informative video
fredeplk copy another reply saw tom nicholas made video titled veritasium story youtube propaganda educational youtubers get paid something present fact spend time skeptical watching nowadays basically scientific balanced view electric car waymo went paycheck involved
maxguerra seem quite vendetta veritasium
fredeplkthis definition advertisement tell right beginning waymo paid make video cant see paid review promote product service paid company make said product service clear obvious conflict interest dont know tell
way cheaper safer environmentally transport state funded public transport channel usually pretty sound video massive sellout shame
first heard people talk selfdriving car thought pipedream still forever honestly dont see cash motivation behind much seems like tech bros year ago really thought would take like year ai would take mundane office task would easily handle selfdriving today theyre stuck investor breathing neck pretend theyll make work soon long possible stave eventual crash moment car emergency brake see pedestrian meter away sidewalk key moment way ever work car module allows communicate know certainty ever car participant using road bus bike etc could similar module way ensure every pedestrian identifyable time would literally chip u could fully realize urban nightmare closed pedestrianless road never happen anywhere else selfdriving mindbogglingly stupid idea born car first society failing see already huge concession towards car hurt instead helped selfdriving fusion technology transportation instead building know work today bet everything stupid gimmick might maybe work someday
waymo uber lyft thus killing everybody job driver killing everyone job fk
yes technological progress without automation would device using make silly comment ironic know
year experience self driving car compared human experience car doesnt learn way mind learns way common sense background human human drive face road human common sense understanding world developed life different kind mind mind car facing many mile tell u nothing wisdom developed mile
dont want better average want better skilled safe knowledgeable responsible local driver want better driver particular skill skill
nice ad fail topic big time
future expect car become self year
would never available louisiana road terrible narrow sharp curve street light line road reflector insane able drive
watching awesome video one doubt remaining mind since autonomous car heavily rely integrity intelligent system making decision would suggest probability system could compromised malicious action especially since something experience made people start put energy compromising autonomous system would highly appreciate video addressing topic
better bus
real question much cost
real question wheres fun driving fun especially back country lane whole point driverless car bother get bus
imsid convenience like time behind wheel going somewhere sometimes want relax actual observer something else besides grey asphalt front next hour driving making similar argument people made horse riding dint age well
hit brake
cotton wool worldpathetic ban motor bike racing eliminate dangerhave remote control f carsstop boxing ufc pr contact sport pe safe soundlet people make risk assessment based thrill finance gadget wont cheap reckon
driverless car drivier board take case emergency put brick accelarator crossed sahara sleeping backseat would driverless car
trust driverless car person still
cant dismiss ethical question unlikely traditionally left decision human free however program exactly told someone need make decision excited driverless car eventually common road hypothetical scenario become reality potential legal interest therefore think focus ahead curve adopting new technology cautious implication way conflict
sad see someone built lot trust respect toss away ad fee
still incredible technology
watch many problem thing going create make perfectly smooth
especially heavily infested traffic zone like downtown area bikers walker sign everywhere
car lawyer wet dream imagine huge liability absorbed manufacturer going absorb cost buyer unless subsidized make taxpayer buyer also danger imposed driver accustomed driving driving car get nonselfdriving car forget wont drive horrible idea
love said automatic elevator though new concept one take granted roll auto driving car got quesion though happens bird crap lidar also could video although electricity slower light use electrical sensor measure light speed always intrigued
assuming coder arent dumb sensor go bird poop something else slow turn hazard light pull stop using sensor measuring speed light simple principle fire laser known distance hit mirror go back time fire come back get speed difficulty complexity getting precise enough equipment facility
title would better eliminate car accident
really good comparison use aircraft system completely different system autonomous system car developed example obstacle avoidance say human made mistake also ironic think autonomous system made developed human never forget
hate driving cant wait ubiquitous
thanks compilation wonder car sense snake lizard road wildlife would brake bc human certainly would
yr said end lol abit optimistic
derek unbiased video response one electricity one he actually value element truth name guess value greed truth wonder happened guy made video spoke student misinformation internet abused bad stuff
ah hold stats portion world war worth death caused impaired driver feel like wouldnt quite extreme considered many people died people choice
first step adoption hopefully sort speed control highway prevent surge stop jam traffic jam reduced virtually nil people start like

waymo waymore see
sorry video pure advertising corporation discussion selfdriving car whole concept transport u city simply crazy costly inefficient unsustainable wasteful term space exist u simply big car corporation including tesla enforce rule unto lawmaker public huge advertising campaings like via veritasium model need come back wellorganised wellfunded mass transportation proximity shopping smaller supermarket simply walk instead huge supermarket twenty mile away compact city waste space parking lot
video get closer understanding progress driverless technology
bruh say pilot pilot definitely want try preforming cat approach
implementation autonomous vehicle reduce amount accident driverless car also able react unforeseen circumstance want adept wide scale also believe still option driver take control case software hardware error driver want drive independently route isnt programmed one problem see criminal legal responsibility criminally legally responsible case accident
video teach anything really long add
really want
computer software program car attacked c virus would manage virus
think there another reason people saying completely agree autonomous car work totally good go next step though law require autonomous car road way ensure computer work without predict human error totally get see way go think well see city first spread dont want get better elevator segment doesnt account true car actually enjoy driving car driving fun many people think better know computer better find enjoyable however future autonomous car wont even need one uber future make sad see maybe thats ok maybe ill still jeep ill able summon autonomous trailer car pick jeep take trail head go hate idea making recreation cumbersome dirt trail touch autonomous road need hire another auto car go next trail autonomous car allowed road maybe jeep autonomous mode wonder much weight add vehicle dont want make trail experience worse dont look forward enjoy freedom roam mountain explore place without autonomous car thats think significant resistance least folk dont overwhelm ultimately take away
dont understand self driving car necessary dont mine driving around understanding
take least another year tech become cheap enough mass production implementation
corporate propaganda shame derek earning enough money channel burn credibility pay bill
whether like dislike self driving car unbelievable amount invested working tech rest assured perfect tech work day come self driving vehicle become mandatory wont able get insurance without

youve mentioned video sponsored company knew would biased video still watched though yes biased video ironically channel called veritasium

airplane comparison ridiculous driver accident human error human one driving foolish statistic poorly referenced quite simple prefer driverless car youre missing point use public transport
well try tesla fsd beta well
like idea think many people feed family driving vehicle continue automation thing le le people gon na needed good
eventualy automation society establish basic liveing payment anyway
think going automated car road like thing elevator cant wait
object unowned system mentality much fan movement among company prevent people owning thing
major issue stopping automated vehicle becoming mainstream liability unlikely talking million thing road millionsbillions mile driven serious accident involving major injury death happen would blame clearly people car maybe company made car company willing take liability maybe
love content creating kind cheesy corporate propaganda seriously damage credibility youtube educator ironically contradicts name channel

think driverless car stupid whole point owning car drive cant stand automatic transmission certainly dont want sit car driving want direct control
car enthusiast agree want drive car people especially developed country car medium transportcommute public transport garbage talking developed country
hacker iot american road yes may safer working look hacking security breach data youll realize many bad actor iot connected car safe ill maybe get autonomous car im old drive right
seems light year ahead tesla
adding green space thats hopeful thinking sound great let assume thats gon na happen
diverless car better say stealing parking spot forcing way driveway traffic changing lane nothing better opponent tesla knowing always fold game chicken
im new york wont impressed see autonomous vehicle nearly time able handle condition rain wind also snow ice leaf road fall etc
watching tomnicholas rip new one inaccurate sponsored propaganda content

alright mate
reepusvanguard yeah came science sale pitch
daric stepping selfdriving car going feel stepping aboard elivator elivator maybe somewhat mini airplane flight airplane extensive flown computer people usually dont buy flight big question couldnt also manufacture fully autonomous vehicle sell market people buy couldnt solve problem total privacy cybercrime owned youre vehicle couldnt ai let driver basic driving maintaining system take sens risk incident weymo vehicle electric powered fueled electric selfdriving would ideal

love idea autonomous vehicle clearly game changer thing clear maintenance vehicle properly maintained malfunction cause accident drive error stuck expensive would hopefully reasonable amount maintenance mid range price would change world point high class people vehicle already chauffeur driving way better average
definitely get point personally main thing would useful wanted go meet somebody bar good time wouldnt worry getting back home find personal pride learning drive would never take away people driving eliminating driving license large population world dont even want drive anyways think thats would help even think allow people want drive later get pride accomplishing something versus something
people good driver drive car florida
florida men woman
veritasium ashamed
good
video age well worse became black mark channel integrity
yes he soley responsible self driving car good take mate
dont like self driving car theyre big kid car cant see driver see theyre expensive bakfiets bicycle tram metro normal train bus best
tf self driving car bigger train mental
nine eleven youll think airplane would become fully automated dead bolted lock
another sunny dry warm calm day test guess theyve solved problem jamming brake plastic bag blow across street winter whiteout heavy rain interstate black ice degree read detour sign confuse human misinterpretation depth field cue easy human hacking gaming system insurance fraud already happens pedestrian lawsuit good yt vids expand problem
need car tested mountain would eliminate error
choice good hope deprive human choice exercise autonomy market force worse yet mandate autonomy human important pleasure driving important statistic
dude still drive car
need nin humman drive oivmces fir ther soices
humman crats oerct act naching se bettr hun stuff
pernct sure chef say yes f oth ssy dnt kniw yers let try
oer sy ues say year put
onky druver new yiur jesy biy frubd stull wirjk ekvator
u implement much stricter driving requirement testing methodology road would lot safer majority accident avoidable due poor decision making road cant fix problem st driverless tech legal time soon many idiot road
road never par
better solution would mass transit railway cheaper new technology required much better environment
going pay
reepusvanguard pay road sure might little bit initial expense two set train track much cheaper easier maintain lane road
siriusvoyager evidence back claim
actually mask deep depression
used anti emojis like making bad joke really sad
watching video driving got fender bender
covid shield
dont drive car
reepusvanguard thing covid shield stop human
im excited hivemind car road
oh
timeline lead walle
car wwiii
car movie
decade later driver car
hard drive hand
video noting add shame pretending honest independant
adding
million died accident arent like k people dismiss person vehicle hit question flippantly afraid isnt good enough issue ignored
dare tesla would also add year away feasible need issue instruction driveway right
id vote well developed public transport adding car wont solve congestion problem regardless smart car city must first walkable bikable bus trammable subwayable etc personal car whether self driven must given least priority possible
vote complaining people internet isnt going fix problem
reepusvanguard isnt going fix change people mind find likeminded people vote option
well guess technically people could average driver driving score remaining bad driving score average would something around would true probably thats respondants thinking duhh
safe driver able operate vehicle safe people operate vehicle technology enable safe people still independent people work rest passenger riding work etc matter time ai technology overcome physical limitation aspect
technology change time car drive safely big deal long area well maintained road vehicle see aspect imagine elderly legally operate vehicle intoxicated person needing ride cant legally drive home could interstate travel would awesome
live sf ive noticed car cruising around neighborhood late night one behind wheel super creepy like moviebook christine opinion however dont need wish didnt want sad think ten yr many immigrant worker rely driving job put food table longer able find suitable employment question reality need observe new technology always best interest
lety made someone lucky man
one want put lot people work electric car worse environment already get stuck snow storm electric car coffin
dude nothing saying make sense
lot people want actually electric car obviously better environment comparable ice car look total environmental impact report electric car last long time snowstorm due huge battery
car enthusiast comment screwed
saying cant car
transit cycling walking livable community also solves problem selfdriving car plus automated metro system across globe vancouver canada example self driving car better normal car alternative car mentioned still better self driving car
vote
car thousand time better average driver like claim get accident
yeah motorsports like nascar indycar f
still horse racing competition motosport safe
yea plane auto pilot way le plane sky car road still pilot ever heard mcas dont trust auto pilot
researcher deep learning done quite study adversarial attack neural network fooled making wrong output example stop sign misclassified speed limit sign imposing crafted noise raise concern self driving car course lot research done defend neural network point time self driving car far reality maybe research ripe enough think
see xkcd
really id rather drive let somebody else drive around
agree autonomous car much better average human driver dont forget psychopath run world abuse power cancelling people allowing use car based social credit system unfortunately learn live without psychopathy supremacy hard pas many like cherish freedom anything else
one thing worry pilot shortage drive single pilot ops zero pilot ops technology enormously complicated compared car elevator something go wrong one person required fly plane get checklist sure pilot cessna significantly le complex aircraft
modern plane mostly automated pilot little stuff plane simply automated red tape hope stay way job security
prof bus tram train taxi form public transportation could fully autonomous soon sure easier drive car cant wait
train tram automated many year
hope autonomous car soon possible majority people absolute idiot
please america build reasonable public transport option beg solves issue
dont want car roadsid feel much safer
thought motion sensor like light turn walk near automatic door market vehicle come range know stop
derek lost credibility video video hereon presented corporate advertising
u like autonomous take bus safer compare plane elevator autonomous work sharing space different intelligence like human unless autonomous
getting camera shot front seat looking back alone arent holding camera
disagree intention ever using driverless car control mass yes average say fact
ive seen drive definitely average kristen
average lmao
driverless car perfect dont perfect better human already
doesnt look like theyve expanded outside phoenix yet
love driving would hate taken away
hope car electric work like oobers cab couldnt driverless car buy dealer personal vehicle dont need parking lot would personal vehicle park could ever get vehicle buy self
cant wait driverless car think insurance company going major hurdle though
develop india successful india definitely successful world
think building self driving high speed train would better stick track there le variable come traffic train tow truck get supply train dont make day travel good would lower cost dont pay driver many hour also since driver local money spent economy would also help truck become solar shorter distance there time charge order
human driving vehicle human error accident im saying redundant factoid blame human driver high blame accident could hardly anything else thats who driving self driving vehicle unless responsible trip made hardly compared way multitude situation including statement high human error experienced computer car wonder human error accident controlled circumstance self driving car trip road condition human error high whats enjoy driving probably would trust one car passing distracted texting drunk drugged emotional disturbed road raged human though
ive saying forever none friend believe
sort ai need cloud reckon cant believe amount compute board
look tesla system work doesnt need cloud connectivity work need sufficiently powerful onboard computer
disappointed derek letting sponsorship get way real discussion
controlled environment like developed city trained disciplined driver around chance throw african south asian traffic good luck propaganda piece presented getting worse hear bad news sell better dissapointed otherwise good channel
ethereal closet tellingly lighten plane opportunely rescue pace square precipitation powerful ugliest haircut
come gon na couple decade least
imagine senior invalid disabled able travel autonomous car
put steering wheel level car help passenger feel ease like red button elevator
love even selfdriving car needed put seat belt lol
ive already ridden many many mile vehicle drive tram train bus imagine safer road would cleaner air would money wasted towards development selfdriving car would invested transit solution instead
im supposed trust judgement woman belief cheap paper face mask prevent dying disease survival rate infected
facemasks prevent spreading virus coworkers etc dont get sick survival rate fact people dont like sick aunt got permanent lung damage covid likely never recover
human being stupid thats need driverless car okay driverless car made human
unbelievably sexy sorryi say
people would happy hear imagine sometime pilot reveal flight autopilot
cousin caught toddler fall flight stair thinking safety bought one child leash next time happened pulled daughter back safety worked well one day wasnt using leash toddler saw flight stair decided throw mind would magically pulled back thankfully wasnt injured video reminded situation becomes common think people would get careless like jumping front automatic car assuming brake instead going crosswalk waiting time
h u g e credibility gap video date stamp disappeared admitting evasive currency video much paid ignore date stamp absence
want bus road train track walkablewheelable neighbourhood arent assaulted noise car place see road arent giant suv parked everywhere yeah always need car selfdriving car take selfdrivings car cellotape bad city design thats bad u many way
imagine pedestrian cyclist world car intersection never stop direction
think want car driverless car various benefit normal car replacing car altogether public transit bicycle even walking make lot sense economically ecologically
doesnt matter self driving car bad city environment
elevator operator alive well tower construction
think autonomous vehicle increase quality life driverspassengers making thing safer le stressful mention one make mistake learn mention think point people stop wanting vehicle autonomous vehicle quickly efficiently dispatched go want without need inconvenience make request human
youre driver autonomous car youre passenger hate passenger whenever im car like one driving
marekkelin yeah take bus every time go office one reason think self driving car stupid dont want drive take bus
couple reason prefer personal vehicle public transportation sanitation convenience lot people poor hygiene consequently lot public transportation vehicle smell like urine tobacco marijuana fecal matter unpleasant odor public transportation well one never know there going delay due tech issue cleaning human waste there traffic decide take alternate route also dont wait someone done autonomous car dont wait stoner peeled floor hop nice clean car go wherever want whenever want also car cool personal vehicle provides sense accomplishment public transportation take charm individualism vehicle amount death due accident sad thats action idiot youd sharing vehicle personally drive pretty safely another big thing well emphasized enough giving control life third party dangerous get wrong side corrupt government system control ability travel youre luck
something like public transport oh god brain broken
james get self driving bus could made theyd cut traffic way self driving car
take car insurance offer deal self driving car fee using human driving car
love elevator comparison seeing chinese video people lose head would probably comfortable use place safe yes
thanks although praise technology trust ton mass motion roadway controlled microchip furthermore seriously trust people
implementing selfdriving car mandate would pretty much guarantee motorcyclist conundrum would never occur
self driving car need cheap enough entire human population would willing switch like car cost like ish doubt human dont make much money would switch like driverless car like
buy
sure fair compare autonomous programmed experience human experience agree basically everything worth noting alot people thought self driving woould looked programming bit interesting thing found way art form tetri programmed two different people function way completely different mechanism logic thing machine logic etc believe accumilating unbelievable amount information computing power start take slow human input programming sidelogic artform logic data translation machine need done checked people doesnt necessarly advance pace moore law people make prediction really hard predict skilled programmer thats real truth fast tech advance necessarily
solution driverless car carless driver solution many car making car electric driverless
believe tech need least year development safe expensive market
car problem destroyed need kept niche thing need better public transport autonomous stinking polluter
amazing advancing ai technology obvious many job replaced ai dire need new system economy people focused making ai tool equally provide remedy thousand life destroyed killing job sensitive issue need addressed seriously technology development happening faster ever
autonomous vehicle spare million life per year need offset million fewer birth reduce population increased emission congestion animalgreen space damage pollution resource depletion come overpopulation birth rate need severely reduced save planet overpopulation aspect even many environmentalist overlook impact meatdairy industry planet
street reasonably clear live usually driving operating car one purest pleasure life big difference pleasure mobility control agency mobility dont like bus taxi yet another genuine human pleasure stripped away replaced numb comfort technology interact online instead facetoface look porn rather sex order amazon instead leaving house shop sit like tumour back driverless car rather operating control paying attention world around u
constructive criticism figure specifically advocating driverless car public transportation toward end hadnt really clarified
wouldnt ppl try jack car time becomes common
way hell either someone wheel way let hackable machine drive edit like drive country taken someone would pay
question autonomous vehicle much better driving human main problem question responsibility legal framework might different many country im curious work
always knew frist car self driving electric maybe true next year
plane info reflect reality also location without defined road area without pingable mast price vehicle handle lefthand v righthand driven road place traffic rule comepletely different nonexistant saying put car challenge ala old top gear put saltflats rainforest highland varied city across world willing grant tiniest sliver trust edit almost forgot handle different weather condition arizona known rain snow ice
fine system hacked
car already hacked controlled directly
legally blind funny term
way glossed issue autonomous driving absolutely killed credibility like yeah road suck lot part world erratic driver thing good condition great accident arent like good answer skeptic accident arent fatal either thats point point car make win decision happen happens infrastructure isnt properly maintained happens around erratic driver comparison plane elevator irritating elevator dont contend traffic mph plane almost never risk crashing top point several big plan crash caused autopilot pilot intervention almost saved flight trust automated driving large portion driver there still long way go im disappointed much video felt like advertisement didnt feel like amount critical thought put
well yes driverless car arent perfect one claiming driverless care safer human even caveat end le accident average human driver le injury death thats matter one trying create perfect car trying make road safer thats exactly diverless car safer human driver mission accomplished
want driverless car road absolutely reason never would buy use car another thumbnail list say computer safe another thing like freedom maybe im last one dont want goverment know get
office people taking waymo office occation really cool see lived glendale commuted chandler couldnt try cool see people

besides reducing accident autonomous car would also reduce necessity vehicle would result le parking room pedestrian
basically trust technology car dont trust car human driving dont control car case human something weird time nothing driverless car road id feel much safe
everybody gangsta self driving tesla turn drive cliff
treat self driving tesla well otherwise send meet god
combing comment section feel everyone asks wonder perform xyz scenario question fishing scenario still convinced human could outperform software even could find one scenario hundred wouldnt still make sense trust entity could outperform real question susceptible software turning outright failing long working properly going superior least average driver
requires much concurrent information average brain parse
reality people get ubers every day people behind wheel hour day fatigued complacent distracted thats safe
think video make fundamental mistake must careful measure performance biased say impossible machine make human error well course definition human make human error say detect stop sign pedestrian meter away biased way measuring performance strict comparison detection mechanism eye v camerasradar say ai driven car would solve many problem like drunk driving elderly driver probably shouldnt drive think time help greatly traffic congestion let overlook problem creates expense ownership general reliability software programming error result kind response compared human almost universally respond driving issue w braking ai might well opposite hence id expect fatality le frequent involve people occur cant help recall office mate phd program took ford truck dealership ac stopped working told needed software update want machine drive work capable failure due software update truck ecu fuel injection thats thats enough installed infotainment center running android touchscreen car dumb rock year counting ive one k mile scheduled maintenance oil change set new tire lead acid battery change new windshield wiper installed wont beat smart car term cost ownership industry know
whats noise
ok real question car using lidar sound basically like echolocation could car lidar interfere signal different frequency dont pick someone el returning signal
watch tom nicholas video call veritasium video completely bought misleading
may favorite channel
there big diff plane autopilot autonomousdriverless car firstly pilot go hundredsthousands hour training standby takeover system issue secondly there always two pilot commercial flight thirdly there control tower directing motor traffic road there lazy type
really like idea autonomous car excited future
great grandkids think insane used drive
u future asking ai long driving ai ive driving since start universe pretty crazy think
understand electric car driverless car future also make sad know thrill driving might go say culture weather like love drive car make car faster fun someone appreciates sad see go
dont need undergo driving test anymore
want far far le current car driven manually yes want current car replaced automatic one absolutely need fewer car road design city infrastructure people use bicycle public mass transport much convenient pleasant car still road used people actually need drive say emergency service truck maintenance workrelated vehicle bakfiets cargo bike isnt enough example one drive hobby im definitely excited technology id argue pushing selfdriving car wrong actually counterproductive approach since attempt leave actual problem place make palpable like seeing someone couple broken rib giving painkiller sure hell able get keep going he got le incentive actually get rib fixed
already way get expected destination driving train bus taxi people like drive car
scary likely malicious hacking loser want harm random public driverless car become mainstream problematic potential never looked hopeful human making mistake seems natural com driver hacked attack randoms may seem like unreasonable fear year ago hacking someone bank account sounded like spy movie stuff extreme care taken step toward type autonomy put human life mercy machine hacker
car extremely loud
im
driving car around favorite thing hope lose option
agree except canadian driver super bad drive u try stick rule get overruled lawbreaker road speeding giving room lane change exit tailgating etc maybe softwaredriven vechiles eliminate issue
live uk true human yes automatic car year away
bro barely afford car one back camera wan na add another camera lidar way jose
camera arent expensive tesla manages camera lidar
people hit car im going zero mile per hour make good driver
fear happens something get damaged doesnt work glitch
death
stop
weird end said shes commuting company offer service bonus package employee car available anyways game changer would company producing le autonomous car would lead le company
ouch losing control life glowing factor traffic improvement
future one owns car every car driverless owned person instead like taxi call car nearest empty car get locatitions take wherever want doesnt matterhow long travel could also really cheap need pay fuel trip
woebegone handsaw simultaneously crash wash understandably risk humorous signature spotted quick argument
someone going brake check ai going road rage
private car rich solution mass transit amerikkka already infected stroad illnes
million driver uk alone average mile year equal billion mile year people killed yearly basis giving solely human driving think amazingly safe considering number
yup job gone good make billion happy limo cab uber ectits customer get free ride greedy want like bezos enough enough maybe time anarchy thier real anger depression set kill screw b car
sit back case crash
think point accident due human error autonomous vehicle wont make kind mistake annoyingly deceptive course computer wont make kind mistake reason make different mistake learned start driving volume human driver many small thing deal everyday make decision car deal new scenario also well maintained road road around mean car practical many place people better repetitive task better decision making
main issue america id say road designed safety dont propper public transport trueout country everyone even dont want drive car get annywhere even elderly
please happen live u
shoot invisible laser beam safe human health
lidar low power safe
problem self driving car computer eventually malfunctionglitch desktop computer phone etc end glitching sooner later something want happening car yeah might drive better human long
forever thats average work jackass
car self driving bus train maybe pedestrian public transport focus maybe dont know make possible go kind shop store place without owning dollar ton piece whats supposed luxury machinery dont know thought
autonomous selfdriving ev revolution coming
im safety technological advance hand love driving car luck car enthusiast able get permit still drive car lot people still love classic big block everywhere lol
big channel big money unsubscribed
real test car would street dhaka city successful guarantee successful anywhere world street almost impossible drive car regularly get single scratch within month
ok get scratch every two month still mission accomplished one trying make perfect car
wylie drive dhaka city guarantee get scratched everyday time month even pro formula racer fearful road drive first time street
hit motorcyclist without helmet punish person wear helmet
lost waymo house googled siried answered way time please hang
happens autonomous car navigation fails waymo
get accident get le accident autonomous car thats point le accident zero possible le better thats going
wylie yeah know making terrible joke waymo sound bit like whammo
remote working
driving limit itll depend road local population drive make sense say open back road wide two lane whatever reason limit mph yet people would higher depending condition account two lane road one side parking people shuffle get hospital work tug fully autonomous yet multiple time day rescue set path away people obstacle im concerned fault accident automatically human fault sensor error damage caused accident accident also damaged wouldnt able tell would company made keep software date vehicle manufacturer hardware manufacturer obviously self driving vehicle owner control labeled full autonomous driving
love first electricautonomous car look like mouse car
go million mile tesla model x even topspeed nonstop youre still gon na spend year inside
think much better solution design city around public transport personal transport many city europe instead car mean required get anywhere state metal box focusing road maybe could ride bike go train bus hell even walk dont focus driving getting destination breathing fresh air along way appreciating surroundings even subway get pas time youre mention car payment gas insurance etc alleviated either small fee ride literally payment leg free transport sad see cant even walk grocery store wish could walk place sidewalk end abruptly road definitely pedestrian friendly
first ev driverless car thing hate totally imagine currently billion death rate decrease going many people without activity everything autonomous nit talking fun included driving future leading
kill fun car car fun drive sit
im pilot often hear people worried safety automation airplane dont understand accident may happen due bad programing machine learned thing never happen teach human basic stuff sometimes still made mistake like percentage fail chance see number car accident machine teach thing never fail thing
since air mistake fatal thats think ppl dont like
make video enjoyed video bitter taste need get rid offas obviously sponsored video im sure know talking mistake happen please dont thank work know stay starting science path love family
enough make young engineer cry
think toy come mind woman got murdered crosswalk one
whole video big advertisement bunch misinformation
simple ppl sometimes speed driving mph long distance boring car self driving everybody keeping distance nobody merging time go mph would much much safer
sooner theyre available road better im tired idiot road
love tesla self driving crap doesnt even understand slip road motorway
fsd beta regular autopilot thats completely different system
logitech perhaps uk autopilot isnt supposed good ive tried friend car got irritated bings bong plus didnt drive anything like id normally drive keep monitoring case cancelled bit stressful self driving car lane keeping fine gimmick genuinely super annoying assumed itd use similar software mean would introduce redundancy code
nikdowd ok tesla system one used called autopilot trafficaware lane assist cruise control system intended highway use one thats relevant future self driving called fsd full selfdriving closed beta need live u need apply get use fsd different beast entirely machine learning based selfdriving ai designed work road anywhere want taste check youtube channel called ai drivr video drive around challenging area dense traffic narrow road complex intersection
disappointed derrick minute long advertisement semblance rigour scepticism generally video say advertisement please feel like something surreptitiously fed via dislike medium admire insight way present way world work well video exact quality squirming throughout video disappointing
little misleading say three incident involving pedestrian look screenshot two incident simulated
guess u people suffering motion sickness always stay behind wheel
driverless car trying solve problem already elegant solution want sleepreadwork commute want reduce congestion road need parking space want feel safer trip take bus train
hate passenger time could ride
dont like freedom read agenda everyone us driverless car soon car bring u place citiesunless criticize giant foreign governmental service corporation taking timeenergymoney case matter want go brought ccp hq
pretty sure car bring wherever told go
automous public transport like sped train japan much developed world future self driving car cool moving away car general
exciting recognize location video shot especially famous location start ride element hotel chandler az phoenix yay everyone else banned driverless car street phoenix allowed waymo operate small part city mainly part tempe chandler waymo still level first rode start pandemic much automated rode next jan
confident steering wheel hand would never put destiny ai hand
police officer pull outdated blocked road turn siren realizes pepul transporting cargo map updated officer tecnology
let car come malaysia doesnt break middle road cry definitely good enough
elephant room technology accident insurance liability autonomous car may well safer never perfect manually driven car rare manufacturer held responsible accident autonomous car manufacturer likely held jointly fully responsible every accident manufacturer afford additionally serious design fault found given model car highly likely like aircraft every copy model country grounded fault rectified also another elephant room politics matter time something bad happens eg accident outside school politician us autonomous car perfect platform scaremongering exaggeration thus getting banned becomes election platform
yeah safer safer better thats literally goal goal accomplished didnt gotcha anything
wylie unfortunately politics trump logic every time
im full self driving car hope arrive soon keep wondering whats going happen stop light cop directing traffic car understand hand signal road worked lane car driving closed car drive opposite side going wrong way understand whats going
yes road never par
yes car need understand hand signal tesla system already extent
ive seen driverless crash thank im going get car crash want reason car crash
ill take le chance crashing im idiot
funny self driving car prove take test people start driving
wonder imagine many autonomous car driving around constant laser beaming lidar influencing human passersby body
finish video got thinking two motorcycle problem think people focus much kind situation true scenery possible consider rare human dont consider either got driver license probability finding pretty low case think may like know human could react kind situation thankfully experiment done year ago person choose train doesnt enough time fully stop go left railway therere group people cant move right railway there one person cant move either result participant choose neither got froze others tried find someone capable dealing situation little minority took decision several second check experiment vsauce one mindfields video point logic answer saving group people instead one wont choose time think saving one people correct going choose option least time there correct answer happens two motorcycle problem cant program ai preferably choose one probability pick weve talking situation car doesnt enough time distance brake driverless car equipped lidar greater visual field humas like derek said video see distance hundred meter giving enough space brake getting away collision route motorbikers also brake get away collision route eliminating problem specially lidar still job even extreme weather perfect dont get wrong dense fog efficacy device isnt sunny day unusable change two motorcycle problem bit car doesnt see motorbikers soon enough trailer blocking view still consider one feature driverless much better u telling others whats going quickly precisely develop car communicate certain pas information surrounding rest make prediction take decision time feature scenario even le possible even impossible due fact still receive information time driverless car road information access le possible accident opinion still need investigate there stuff need improve also instead afraid oppose fund get even better make travel even safer
much pay shill
im impressed waymo geofenced check tesla fsd beta want see coming waymo operated small area mapped centimeter tesla car drive anywhere
thing dont trust human firm general rule sure hell wont trust human creation xd dont think want driverless car thank make point guess
need tested place like nashville equivalent congested area
test ive seen ideal condition new car year old sensor soon another big problem inconvenience sensor fail saying problem car may may true failing sensor av become older cause major accident
mikeofallon sensor fails car cant get right data itll obviously drive around one camera tesla get covered something car notifies engage autopilot
logitech computer must able know sensor camera failed tesla still rearend stopped vehicle catch fire let see video taken night bad weather nonobvious visual queue like detour temporary signage im tech lack adequate testing dishonesty appalling ev av maybe failing sensor big problem due short average lifespan ev economic reason
mikeofallon course able tell sensor malfunctioning tesla still get le accident average car theyre x le likely catch fire average car
logitech many bad human driver point av fully tested serious accident human would avoided tell sensor failed system must otherwise working ev catch fire newsworthy much bigger problem course responder ev burn day people dont even know ev run primarily diesel gas think run wind solar due dishonesty politician even practical plan change
sponsored waymo remove credibility
love technology much autonomy
well would vehicle work inclement weather
lidar based system like waymo pretty crap poor weather camera based system like tesla fsd work pretty much weather
nitpicking bit pilot landing manually sunny day much true idea better let plane land weather bad incomplete cat iii autpilot engaged touchdown approach used specific condition condition insufficient visible reference land eyesight condition part exist wind wind gusting still much wantneed human pilot perform landing say impossible current state art thats
electric
here thing fully automated car couldnt drive way certain feeling driving feel tire pavement feel resistance headwind vibrating vehicle roar engine drive fast automated vehicle system couldnt drive way
magic ballet car point pedestrian cross world dominated machinecars role human play road
auto body industry go broke

want missile fly dream fan technology perfect
favorite past time driving sorry cant
car road driverless wont lidar driverless vehicle possibly interfere sensor
favorite thing world driving riding take fun adventure plus computer control program gov want go somewhere problem excited much getting behind wheel awesome monster charger awesome camaro

people say car robber
would like see automobile tested thirdd world country pothole common existence
get fact video sponsored waymo didnt like tesla achievement mentioned mean unlike waymo drive particular area tesla drive almost anywhere always admired vertasiums video still feel like quite bias one
driverless car started google year ago competition universityes beacause even lot people
fascinating video always derek one year since published video far know still far commonplace yet let see next year
id get dressed car way work
still reality building one lidar computer etc buck someone could earned driving year id rather help person
dont need lidar autonomous driving
european take bus
buy actually enjoy driving dont need admit computer always better repetitive task like landing aeroplane driving car thing happen may need act unusual way unless give thing machine learning wont happen oh machine learning come lot problem
hope wouldnt glitch lightning strike tho arent living surface hijacked would car robber try stop u thing r yet explained video
like science version mrbeast making whole video sponsored thing
think work city backwoods live line road barely pothole
tesla system work driveable road sure well detects pothole thatll definitely thing soon enough
driver job u welcome world genius make people useless make feel way thank god gun kill quicker would u die despair

cant wait
wait get hacked
totally believe self drive car better driver safer driver sure like driving car really like driving car honestly dont like take public transport possible let hyper efficient electric car produced totally green way lord dont make take public taxi everywhere go dont need stress

incredibly disappointed handled criticism video sad see science enthusiast ti correct mistake clearly pointed accountability taken
cant wait future transport autonomous traffic smooth need traffic light traffic sign exception sign pedestrian car autonomous longer need real sign sign programmed navigation system car car would drive really smooth wouldnt need sign

hope god never happens computer perfect good human program also lack human instinct reaction time prefer car actual competent behind wheel human need stop focusing computer everything start learning thing correctly
human barely program machine learning majority work
know whats better driverless car one could hold people thatd effective oh wait thats train
problem automated vehicle tech isnt safely place difficult get automated human driver road driving together human driven vehicle always problem also folk think flying car would good idea lot people safe bloody ground let alone air scenario would easy call drive right middle let attentiveness run course motorcyclist alert theyll miss car either one isnt paying attention likely bell end without helmet splat
doesnt matter using one car made legal tomorrow none u able afford one
would feel much safer road autonomous vehicle honestly wish vehicle fully autonomous could biased someone close killed car accident another seriously injured car accident drunk driver call biased sane human would admit autonomous vehicle would made mistake reason like sit back wait perfection autonomy think complicated moral dilemma average driver killing people every day
side mirror
local law likely
issue system failure software error hacker etc main lydar malfunction battery dy etc traveling highway happen stop car would need set sensor camera power supply computer system etc wired operating independently take instantly case anything failed primary system predict many accident poorly maintained old compromised system could fail time
real delamain cyberpunk
issue government interference pick bet government going dip hand get taste like able control people travel locate people dont imagine theyll able help abusing power safety
clearly dont know public transport
hayrotheguye clearly intend using condescending attitude make point instead discussing like reasonable person
accident due human error car driven human car driven ai perhaps accident would due ai error alone convincing argument
cant wait see video people get road rage driverless vehicle
even realize concept induvidual mode transportation stupid time seat car occupied one person time damn car stay parking lot
car never going work much stupidly designed city bike lane love one ever mention self driving car video many people died accident vehicle lol
make wonder could give car whole bunch random peoplevolunteers week would solidify opinion idk
giving misinformation asiana flight crashed due number error one input auto landing set properly please educate
great safer human driver question car behave meet mad driver follow role
future going car air automatically driving
illegaly blind people
mil vid epic
imagine cop come pull see driver police license regist driver
problem ppl never want drive without driver technology stop technology expensive many reason
get flat tire
call help like usual
government love driverless car shut whenever want even tell car lock inside drive police station
review ad
would never
like amsterdam destroy root problem limit car emission sea asphalt tram walkablecycling infrastructure cant
never travel three mile yeah make sense everyone life pod eats bug
cworm tram train definitely effective efficient comparison mile nothing every bike ive ever used many alterities better maximizing efficient usage space meanwhile still futuristic appearance im assuming want pod bug part want simply showing life city rather long barren grey stored also cheaper country could save money use futuristic thing would like mention walkable city lot building mixed use meaning store house closer equal high density housing equal housing housing help housing crisis good economy boost gdp country america thats there housing crisis creates possibility bigger funding thing help create futuristic thing
im sensing many u commenters response counterintuitive statistical proposition like survivor bias type bias rejecting fundamental idea case autonomous vehicle easily better average driver main cause accident
cant compare plain flying car driving plain dont need fly specific rail crash except landing takeoff situation plane know exactly runway due completely mapped airplane computer constantly communicating tower currently possible car car derails little bit something hit pretty much everywhere make compareable self flying plane every road everywhere need mapped like airplane runway much harder considering amount road world road straight line like runway even road one day mapped slef flying plane self driving car still compareable airplane doesnt anything avoid thr trip unlike car constantly avoid everything around plane know nothing surprisingly get way car allways anticipate happen
good condition technology functional year problem reliable need little bit pretty much anything make car like unfunctional bit rain clearety go problem road wet physical calculation problem road wet reflects object may seem like object flying towards car inside road road end maybe there wall tha car may even fail see wall curb wet curb road connect say okay rain switch system drive slower use higher security meassures whatnot doesnt rain road wet detecting much difficult big picture way many dependency cant predict come driving road real people world
feel like autonomous driving going universally adopted city reduce congestion car culture least america would take several generation give right drive
dont think car solution future transportation urban suburban area driverless
dont care drive gas electric autonomous vehicle long affordable instead luxurious toy doctor people high paying job afford
waymo never accident atfault
dont forget weve driverless car mar decade fact still dont driver day
main benefit would extra hour day thing perhaps better option parking car go park far away go office
responsible crash
million death le year including life changing injury thanks education
good thing possibly needed thing want end casualty road
happens one allowed drive car moreover dont know drive car going get dumber dumber able anything future
ah classic argument writing bad make u dumber wont memorize everything shite piece logical trash debunked thousand year
thanks id prefer car efficient boring cheap public transportation
worry delivery charge get low people start ordering individual grocery item door think toothpaste running low ill order give minute later amazon van arrives thus vastly increasing number journey therefore congestion name trivial convenience
video waymo propaganda anything else
wonder handle fog heavy rain
front seat belt ocked sat front seatcos car drive themselfs still need person front seat emergency steering wheel iff run self duz steering wheelthe way u overpower car go autopilot lock door put seatbelt get backseat co think sat seat iff u dont wont set car semi self driving car full self driving co belt wheel
autoautomobile come inevitably either hitting person crossing street swerving avoid going road tree take injury
could sleep hour car wake need
live inwant
everyone really need stop talking environment hold comment hater proven planet cycle hot warm cool cold frozen cold cool warm hotetc forever nonstop speeding next cycle idk matter idk human parasite planet clean needed never stop
always go nothing happy scenario like full control ownership transportation happens system get hacked crashing driving system little couple day would catastrophic everyone adopts
social credit score incoming
driverless car thanks
want bad imagine many problem solved
funny enough riding one feel like youre jurassic park haha
anxiety part around driving try avoid driving going onnear road much possible disabling idea one day could reduce road accident help disabled people rely human driver best thing could wish really hope come soon
fun game till someone hack sends drug operating ring
clearly bad news people enjoy driving vehicle future world would ban manual driving
went phoenix last year try waymo see hamilton thought driverless ai going make mistake kill people entire network learn mistake repeat human hand repeat mistake
im nigerian thought tesla thing
self driving car never worldwide capable number capable environment self driving car delegated well developed city without high traffic flat terrain
probably better average driver though one crash happen crossing none stoplight worked several day mess thing actually got worse every day
reading comment seems biggest problem ai car deal human human driving ai car would le complex problem since ai drive car car distracted drunk sleeping drugged type human problem error honestly believe selfdriving car far safer humandriven car especially time since car newbie start year knowledge also spare problem paying driving school know maybe even lower price car insurance
behind every great scientist corporate sponsor seriously dont video showing explaining cool notsocool stuff selfdriving car stop telling think think waymo think think hmm
veritasium gravel road road iceblack ice road freshly fallen snow northern state winter road
try mumbay jakarta
much experience done winter north testing ideal circumstance course make everything seem great
automatic driverless transient get fully driverless car driverless car tackle problem caused manual driver example someone suddenly change lane common india
take florida appalachian backcountry road would accident minute hopefully get banned nationwide
audi sound sick tho
people terrible driver texting driving maybe people right drive
funny driverless seat seatbelt lol
hacking car one really talk much speaking autonomous car picture least horror scenario get hacked youre essentially driving computer hacking story every day thing nowadays
highenergy particle space crash car cargo fan
honestly replace car something really simple train take bike walk te final distance sure youll need robust train network absolutely doable since well netherlands exactly network plus bike walking destination
amsterdam outside amsterdam everyone drive eveyone know including
hamsandwichindahouse every major city small town extensive public infrastructure bus rentabike train really rural area would car essential
netherlands one densest country world basically one big city u entire continent cant build train bus lane everywhere bike cant go far enough quick enough isnt compatible lot extreme weather usa need public transport walkability urban area build train lol viable solution transport need large country point point transport anytime anywhere always beat public transport lot task
realize europe continent pretty good network train right could easily travel london madrid within day train hour would car bit mile time reducing ecological footprint put perspective chicago new york little le mile take hour country local network maybe le efficient idea size argument mentality even china investing hst
paulisebaert yes know live europe commute every day train bicycle first one travel train london madrid requires multiple interchange single flight make trip hour half price agree french policy replacing shorthaul flight high speed rail making hour train journey something nobody yes major city well connected rail lot road transport disincentivised improve expand public transport system simply unrealistic replace car large scale always efficient way travel distance even term environmental standpoint remove return term transportation even netherlands dense country regarded best public transport infrastructure world car far used method travel build efficient transport system requires combination public private transport silly rely one
get malfunctioning software though people still healthy good driving record still prefer would rather control rely computer everything even right hate car im driving slows car make slight steering wheel adjustment dont want dangerous want ever drive fully autonomous vehicle least cant drive car anymore
cant wait driverless car become normal idk people would driveway though see benefit area public transportation especially elderly person disability delivery basic need shutins vehicle would also assist making public transport available small rural area
dont want driverless car want public transportation operated busestrainstramsmetros get point theyre high capacity vehicle much much safer car dont want driverless car
want better public transportation like netherlands example everywhere
selfdrivimg car would make lockdown much easier next pandemic car would go within range limit location allotted expert emergency could take hospital despite prohibition wouldnt allow drive anywhere else dont spread disease bet australian would loved last pandemic selfdriving car would also excellent tool rehabilitating people commit crime hatespeech racist discrimination etc rather giving people jailtime probation nothing authority could selectively modify ability travel using selfdriving vehicle example also cab driver long haul truck driver would basically lose job free time sitting around ubi paid remaining workforce scratching ass watching netflix amazon prime among hang vr chat room meta future sure looking friendly
dont forget climate emergency authority could limit travel credit tm limit impact co level think possibility
lol jeep liberty lifetime warranty aint way giving
great video im honestly disappointed human technology ready quite time implemented already
sold soul uu
bus version
people see driverless car coming throw wheel claim lifetime worth healthcare
used driver elevator ek se wat
statistic skewed number bad human driver road youre actually comparing good human driver ai system comparing apple pear dishonest
fully embrace technology soon coming stopping question nd rd order effect automating function required rapt attention complex decision making specie evolution use time saved driven instead driven noble lofty challenging pursuit betterment society would great automate think le march ever onward towards idiocracy feeling far backseat viewing real housewife instead seeking new height art science
gana sponsor bill gate book say great book lmao
aware job loss ai job allways taken human taken ai one watch punish ai mistake job available allways since doesnt matter advanced ai evolve directly proportionally best example animal already u watch
people would able escape police
would rather carless street
one money
cyber attack mercy someone dont want driverless car want give piece freedom go ahead
overtheair update system get hacked russian million car drive road
hmmm noticed something wont lidar get messed car around using thing sensor picking signal picture wont clear anymore
much cost cant build pc dont crash let alone pc wheel
driverless car great close zero car city would better
take blame crash
crash life important passenger life car life pedestrian life car going choose survive problem
job people lose due automation
driver autonymous semitruck companywe test stuff av car easy truck hard dynamic two totally different vehicle one step fully autonymous truck
overcaffinated bozo uber didnt shower day sign
personally would love driverless car something like drop front building car go park biggest problem see pricing law might scenario car owned corporation effectively get taxied around problem rush hour pm everyone need car nearly nobody need car company buy enough rush hour reserve car first come first serve basis happens reserve car prior rider vomited left stuff plus government body actively saying driverless car various place
im canadian thing work heavy wet snow blinding rain splashing water leak
keep talking death yet car accidensts fatal car damage area autonomous car company keep hiding case car hitting pay damn insurene tesla im one blame paying expensive car first place
fine dandy sitting back seat letting car drive good luck electronics fail
say electronics would fail often human make mistake lol whole video went right head
generic npc name check
wanted point want truthful video selfdriving car allow sponsored specific selfdriving car company entire video biased towards specific sensor technology choice made google ultimately inadequate solving real problem may good replacing taxi limited premapped area never able replace driverowned car need able travel anywhere without hd mapping truly unrestricted selfdriving far harder waymo realizes tiny fleet glorified trolley keeping blind mountain technical challenge lie ahead exchange money truly care improving road safety need able replace million privately owned vehicle already road waymos business model never happen vehicle sensor expensive anything highusage taxi service actually fully agree selfdriving technology far safer people realize instance many laypeople seem misguided idea goal literally zero selfdriving accident yet could preventing million accident today technology however due sponsorship ask enough meaningful question prove idea audience kind defeat purpose covering topic first place
clear city center car become autonomous quality autonomy would improve iot road grew connection point greatest concern would security involved company controlling perhaps hundred vehicle even human life time site security network security would make break
air traffic control incredibly rigorous reason
dont feel honest representation self driving vehicle really love chanel wish would stick unsponsored video scientific honest mean name chanel element truth unfortunately doesnt really apply video opinion
funny driver le car seat driver
say come responding emergency vehicle queue vehicle could react well sound siren emergency vehicle flashing light top also flashing light intersection triggered emergency vehicle force light change queue arent currently monitored certainly offering suggestion appropriate please send way make aware signal also know emergency vehicle force light change unique light isnt visible naked eye could also sensor look signal well
lol ppl comment section reacts exactly like guy refused take elevator without driver think definitely changed waymo want inevitable already know guy problem deal economic difficulty coming along advance technology like unemployment current human driver possibly much lesser demand manually driving car bankruptcy word reliability already certain level trustworthy thus even topic talk decision maker million drive accident pedestrian hitting stopped vehicle accident involving human driver happened human driver follow road regulation reasonable person choose rationale better safe human driver driveless car
plot twist hq there guy controlling car
whats going happen computer system malfunction youre back seat laptop
malfunction
kind sellout arent wont watch video
wonder long norm auto driving people think irresponsible manually driving car
hate thing saying computer unethical really person autonomous vehicle wouldnt crash like computer would stop happened
yeah plus people act like theyd make better decision lol seen vsauces video trolley problem even people like half minute thinking often freeze dont anything computer would far better reaction optimize survival rate people better person could
scam hired john cena driver seat
people dont stay lane say man currently america
may area u example make sense big wide road city built car truck mind chance historic european city experience common sense take precedence rule protocol driving sidewalk someone helping holding traffic pull truck huge investment development lot interesting work developer expert economic model look good
lot ball identify accident using letter
good thing safety derek please make video inefficient car much energy consume much space take city much traffic jam produce take space much efficient way transport modern train hold people thats km twolane highway full car car practically worker transportation time stupid idea choose car main way transportation idea working car sleeping car let empty car drive around producing cartraffic make traffic jam
best thing autonomous car u become driverless taxi worst continue wretched car dependence
ad isnt usual caveat youd expect channel educational scientific
caveat thinking derek didnt mention
illustrates bright future hope automotive maker adopt quickly put place future spoke although doubt let go cashcow fossil fuel mass manufacturing
okay walk stationary car
russia hack system program automated car crash people
car would interact independently implementation ai locally also assume arewill numerous security measure ensure code isnt tampered
simply another lazy ploy enrich put many work save money see obviously bright blinded tech advance dream future mean comprehend amount people rely transportation work whether truck driver ridesharetaxi lot people depend job survive people matter much though right way dependent technology instead unlocking unknown specie planet constantly search alternative supposedly make life easier continues encourage antisocial behavior worrying example mass shooting u traced back technology antisocial lack companionship mean locked inside room without purpose people remind meaning life mind wonder dark place internet plenty frequent visitor place teenager child totally okay right society going wakeup realize technology answer proven healthy society literally incapable turning last time left phone home go night started conversation someone know inperson nuff said problem technology something need done late maybe already seeing toddler glued cellphone tablet pc pretty worrying generation raised without current tech mostly able live without kinda one raised technology need worry
bet one elevator driver past
dream autonomous driving get van friday night family wake saturday morning beach currently live hour away closest one spend day enjoying clean hop back van wake back home ready new day ive excited possibility long time guess rate increase technology could year
also need account damaged technology mom ever speeding always speedometer broken couldnt afford fix
hang touched something wont need parking car dropping heading back home
car sharing
well part wouldnt need car itd like lyft without paying much driver
dont think people fear computer ability drive compared human creator capability understand creator robot
driverless car going next excuse poor urban planning prioritising car pedestrian bike public transport also autolands demand increasing separation traffic reducing capacity suspect deployment challenge driverless car going significant le car centric environment u city suburbia
well self flying plane good seen strong crosswind landing done manual
imagine public transport instead car
vehicle waymo experience well played
good safe take away job human maybe even causing huge gap economic class dont actually know would love know would impact lively hood like worth worth
amount job lost could least partially filled people needed manufacture maintain moderate vehicle like support staff derek called
happens carjacker want hurt passenger would easy stop car anything done prevemt
lock
dont bust window
cameronvaughan case current car lol
train exist yet isnt simpler driverless car
train great designed moving long distance transport many thing get city city even different part city case subway local travel different building train arent realistic
anonymous sorry thats meant question autonomous train exist think way simpler make autonomous train since folow rail
leocabaret moment pretty much stage plane there usually driver work done computer however without driver train assume id imagine still controlled influenced way people outside train
tesla got caught thank
imagine much safer efficient would car road automatic
imagine much safer efficient would reduced number car road got people use public transport instead
acasta dang
mf like hello mike terminator uber mode
let see computer get hacked let someone else take control thanks vehicals
computer control car localfree outside influence wifi like
thats like thinking hack microwave wirelessly
hmmmm going make car driverless might well fit people make longer wider make car travel closely together possible avoid wasting space actually let chain together need one engine move multiple car define predetermined station people get chain car think idea genius idk anyone else hasnt thought yet american goddamn
human driving still better computer driving cant deal debris road well human also bird strike could knock sensor computer get hacked almost certainly cant drive road condition well etc many problem havent solved yet
able deal debris road perfectly fine lol wouldnt bird knock mass metal bolted roof car think bigger thing worry dinosaur back car never hacked obfuscated code would independently implemented car without outside influence isnt scifi movie also would driverless car ever need go offroad us road plain even needed still manually take control anything current car able self driving one
limit amount driverless car use ethanol
navigation need constant update
lol knew driverless vehicle still expected someone step beginning
driving vehicle want priority need siren
drive around australia next visit lidar better tesla
cruise control move make change direction decision last minute sightseeing
flex like fully manual nissan gtr collection
im really disappointed didnt properly cite source one
one actually like driving
arent driving fun
there way tech work kind winter scenario road line obvious curb unpredictable stopping distance snow covered signage something tell there reason happing phoenix
im perfectly okay self driving car think need fix road make sure road construction ai notified
software actually gain experiance ai doesnt accumate thing programmed basically prgrammer gaining experience software
hey bro speed car
future fat people xdd
think driving oyourself exercising
well im accualy interested still group adpeople looking comment section video video blind ad live
advertisement still online educational using crashed plane proof human error known auto pilot put throttle zero distasteful
whole video ad educational video still gullible
need car
much autonomous driving system cost thats going huge impact quickly becomes commonplace
future go trusting self driving car viewing manual driving needlessly dangerous
could update please
might crosswalk go straight turn left turn black hole ye ye robot normal
driving delivery job lost mass unemployment
delivery driver still want self driving car
concept autonomous good wont solve traffic city planner refer induced demand whenever freeway like lane katy freeway add new lane new lane equal driver road since supply get traffic since extra capacity meant car freeway expansion filled new car also say autonomous car future go around like network break anything would cross city pedestrian like deer running road near impossible best solution get rid car focus rail denser city take people car
im self driving car believe road driver actually enjoy task driving like car enthusiast shouldnt becky who minute late work trying put make finding nearest starbucks
actually dont need driverless car need le car mode transportation
bias always intrigued never subject serious always accurate measure skill know pas baton wonder make people susceptible bias maybe experience egodeath edit accurate mean giving accurate rangeestimation ability never seem position either overestimate underestimate however sometimes find hyping capability job interview know dont never get hired everybody else
realy think u perfekt selfdriving car since city huge street space everything spacious big selfdriving car wont interact much stuff around road compare german street sometimes meter street direction bus need go imagine u trained ai pretty much confused since likely struggle go narrow street would always prefer selfdriving car human driving sidenote think germany selfdriving car huge problem first alot german really live car basically whole personality carsecond already realy difficult establish speed limit establish new rule germany anyway last least germany regulation probably allow sytem proven year automobile lobby allows
wouldnt multiple car lidar system interfere individual wavelenght
driverless car would work way better everyone driverless
honestly dont think road ever fully autonomous least anytime soon people enjoy car way much think could likely huge increase automated car though
id trust autonomous vehicle im fan sharing sure better environment probably budget bus metro fan sitting people whatever left spit seat getting finger shewing gum reaching something seat staring sharpie tag front whole ride id love vehicle wich could go back park house used familly member
girl hit stationary object
really understood video waymo thought would
ride back seat funny still look like conventional vehicle entire interior redesigned
wonder well driverless car work rainy icy cold road slip chain wheel might advisable car know put nice sunny condition sure maybe driverless car ok yet rough weather condition hmmmmmmm wonder work train sydney many computer board day certain train line driverless trainsthose distrust govt stopped medium putting bad news onto tv etc public unaware real stats driverless train
autonomous car need go hand hand universal basic income cant imagine impact would economy make driving job redundant
every year equal participation automated car comparing apple lack orange glitch lidar mud camera car wont realize faulty
advanced system like able detect glitch system anomaly camera could lead car functioning properly easily detected
marius detection one thing right reaction automated system something else
phadrfoe would right reaction problem cant see winshield mud swipe camera proper well developed system cant perfect thats goal goal way better human
marius foolprof way better human system wouldnt excessively expensive isnt
phadrfoe technology advance cheaper system become price hardly argument
feeling minute quasi safety substitute proof
let forget ethiopian airline boeing max systemic flaw brought plane almost company anecdotic proof proof
good condition big
name mean truth success crippled credibility much truth omitted
imagine car getting hacked rest upto imagination
car controlled locally server hacked hack microwave
marius cant even hack smartphone
krishnendubiswas best hacker world probably none hack microwave mess car controlled within car nothing hack
marius maybe outside world
driver earn driving
elevator dont crash elevator airplane still pilot terrorist dont hack mind
ai drive lazy homer simpson laying couch giving raising one arm try grab remote control coffee table four inch fingertip sooooo far
much gps screw tell turn dirt field highway way im going drive ai controlled car
last thing want see behind ai driven fully loaded semi coming grade mountain road ice blizzard
able walk bike take public transport
problem driving actually fun
seeing ad within waymo ad blew mind hard enough unsub trash
traffic light anymore amazing
responsibility human involved much easier assign blame punish one blame huge corpo blame like google yeah good bloody luck makling pay failure
ohhhhhoho time shitshow start veritasium
another sponsored video aka advertisement
want driverless car dont want people keep lying available everyone
cool worried go international many product perform poorly outside america simply bias developer hope aware bias well deploying internationally
fully share view one big push come elder people able move autonomously
agree self driving vehicle road way wreck
want two thing federal law say autonomous accident happens car data sensor must made available every autonomous car designer within set time limit every manufacturer say weve tested data simulation vehicle would responded based data adding improvement second want self driving semitruck trailer converted luxury rv go vacation climb say want see mount rushmore summer go
""
almost circumstance data wouldnt much useful information since fault autonomous system good idea one would major benefit rarely
imdemonalchemistthe biggest benefit would increased confidence technology car company compete convince consumer system reliable year almost every car used market come autonomous driving accident would extremely rare car operating driving rule
rubbish propaganda never happen ffs get realistic
remember city built nondriverless car hell hole city built driverless car also hell hole
san francisco many driverless car many year one really notice anymore thing annoying theyre overly cautious compared human cant wait till human dont need take wheel anymore
vehicle automation cant come soon enough
cant wait new car movie
big problem driverless car amount data need work every road scenario astounding million mile driving single city manually mapped ensured thing work worksthese car would work random road outside phoenix
get polled self driving car speeding
today get taxi powerful computer known universe drive want go future able get taxi driven narrow ai model net benefit zero except pay tax support taxi driver benefit aint future grand
maybe could invest actually functional public transport join developed world guess there noone sponsor video area u
""
auctionedpapertowels nervously laughing sign deep dont actually disagree know correct
rodegon
doesnt sponsored video tag
know let go complete machine learning assignment
people speeding le likely get accident reason dont want driverless car dont drive commute drive enjoy driving
fun game til someone hack malintent
may full self driving sedan get diverted flirting nice looking corvette driving next
never exceed speed limit go flow traffic car maintain speed limit regardless flow around create dangerous scenario impede natural customary speed driver compelled go around slowpoke get back traffic equilibrium weve
moment accepts pay check trade trust shamelessly shill corporation
fully admit im bad driver cant wait come reality bet im one willing admit
nah hope becomes reality
great video
riding autonomous vehicle reminds jonnycab total recall
month later think driverless car road cause automatically run cop wheeee
whats gon na happen car company driving law completely autonomous vehicle illegal one le fortunate people cant constantly pay new ride everywhere economy rise fall many question many car company make jump keep thriving one law code many question
technology could eliminate anime backstories guaranteed
idk im disappointed ad research expert opinion based objective fact enjoy video truly disappointing ad youre sponsored maintain integrity science pursuer
phx last week saw car many occasion phx part aircrew travel around state never seen car anywhere else curious know market found
one advantage feel missed video speed limit speed limit exist minimise accident severity thereof due human error car become driverless speed limit especially highway motorway interstate major road raised without issue thus allowing everyone get destination quicker
thats cute get ready speed limit go
create whole ton noise imagine trying get sleep world car whizzing kmh outside window

im surprised nobody ever brings see elephant room insurance liability state differ way require driver insure vehicle florida fault insurance call fault insurance thats kind everything fault person assumes share liability big cost insurance pip personal injury protection basically insured proportionate worst driver road make insurance expensive digress live litigious society know sound awful let face going happen happens autonomous vehicle run somebody kid liable owner car passenger car manufacturer car author software victim bad luck dont ask make point ask seems like question answered thing road surely cant imagine backer waymo putting money behind thing anyone insuring without knowing exactly liability begin waiting test court inevitable highly unfortunate finally happens dont get wrong im huge fan technology im software engineer im fascinated technical level im also legally blind drive modern society thats akin prison sentence im largely prisoner home without relying others ferry around yes uber course wife neither anything remotely resembling sense independence people experience others like would literally revolutionize access world decade small underrepresented population never really received practical solution challenge autonomous vehicle would close gap
wonder parameter self break down like tire blow lightning strike mechanical catastrophic failure procedure someone heart attack cant hit button keep driving entire trip there onboard visual monitor
given want protect investment taxiesbussestrains cctv course heicles made public brakedownstyre failure would pull side road could find safest place could like human driver advantage would know far human car could stop major failure even immediately alert authority broken delay digging phone trying remember need call could even call another vehicle passenger get delayed heart attack similar event already safety system place large machinery tower crane excavator detect driver impairment adding vehicle wouldnt difficult apply one person vehicle people monitoring vehicle make priority chance two people ill insanely small also vehicle could detect push emergency button could change route nearest hospitalerae automatically alert hospital authority even given priority driverless vehicle encountered imagine put directly vehicle already way hospital focus answering question keeping passenger alive arrive
theblackeventorizon
could die train nobody sits near get heart attack rest could probably fixed maintenance getting hearth attack day seeing vehicle allowed u street
primary mode blast ambulance siren speaker around town drive slow
autonomous vehicle learned adversarial attack also know waymo driverless car phoenix best road condition autonomous vehicle
driver beeing average possibel atleast opinion ther quite horrible
amaaaazing im looking forward advancement area especially since dont license mean get one im surprised car already licensed drive
happens there enough laser beam shine others sensor
problem still running software software get hacked type glitch big problem
right joke
driverless car decide running old person student wouldnt drive start driving useless driverless car cool human cause cross road whenever want oftentimes reckless
spent year trying teach computer recognize human voice still get wrong essentially every single sentence dictate youre going trust computer navigate curvy snowy road night youre going trust life life child computer confuses taco go think time start consider year still reliable selfdriving system anywhere close safe human behind wheel
still device confuses taco go stop using year old phone computing ai come long way rather trust system thats built driven around drunkard driving car snowy road middle night think time start consider le year reliable self driving system better best driver
nobody know mile anymore tell u distance speed kilometre
technology limite
emergency break
matter wanting driverless car matter trusting life car drive way like fail safe
yeah noticed said least good condition basically meaning would never work say like chicago middle winterand hand got uber wanting implement imagine car going look like inside six hour shift ubering people like hopping porta john driving around kind drug paraphernalia feces urine garbage name
vehicle computer connected would eliminate accident also cop could actually go real crime leave u alone car ownership become obsolete would rather pay monthly fee car come needed expensive repair insurance cop ticket owner
great documentary put human life computer alone big risk computer need good split second decision avoid cathasrophic potential accident probably human better
im sorry driverless system wont work conjunction human driver entire system would driverless
may concern sentient human ienjoy driving done past year wish live governed algorithm end
like driverless car waymo catching cab
great weather people love thisbut strong winter storm give human
absolutely horrible idea
yet another paid propaganda video tool know better c lewis put best tyranny tyranny sincerely exercised good victim may oppressive would better live robber baron omnipotent moral busybody robber baron cruelty may sometimes sleep cupidity may point satiated torment u good torment u without end approval conscience c lewis
draw beautiful future minus skynet control
driverless car fine ai revolt take havent people seen terminator matrix movie
one need know im going need know im going
would feel safer networked electric automated vehicle one driven human road human
solution commuting problem prolonging current garbage already need better designed city public transit massive social shift treat elderly disadvantaged

lying u driver invisible
want go concert taking path jammed know alternate path isnt get vehicle take also say going sea world impromptu placed cone may different next week traffic director telling go way way autonomous car deal also keen driverless car mountain road steep drop left right long driveway enough room one car oncoming car happens rideshare companiestaxies use car people littering car graffiti etc driverless taxi doesnt fare go
guy cart near crosswalk caused hard stop could easily criticized far better err side caution realistically careful significant risk bad result ethically medically legally like hitting pedestrian crosswalk cringe lot watching tesla fsd beta video wild inconsistency safety issue thus far sometimes timid proverbial little old lady driver around pedestrian time blast big truck parked side road flasher busy residential area acting completely oblivious driver random pedestrian might step behind truck clearly far easier waymo one city time tesla prove highly reliable generalized solution city city approach outfit like waymo mobileye taking clearly superior real world geofenced l robotaxis practical economic model person im strongly rooting robotaxis becoming common enough cheap enough medical procedure car need worked etc easily affordably take cab walking isnt convenient distance weather feel day etc
there fundamental flaw autodrivers mixed u itll always maintain safe following distance rush hour driver fill gap repeatedly autodrive becomes slowest vehicle thus rolling obstacle add rush hour see happens current roadway barely adequate cram vehicle line tailgating
good public transport well designed city
albertkwalsh public transport loool make think want share transport space
croikeymatesthrowashrimpon trust buddy mutual
albertkwalsh clearly isnt mutual since obviously want public transport ill ask make think want sit lower class
croikeymatesthrowashrimpon well see europe taking public transport isnt poor people better way getting around car completely fine dont want take pay premium use car high gas price taxing car
future think car could good driving would able drift go way faster driver wish car talk know limitation reason go slow
old head thank rather control vehicle
nice press release
veritasium hello im sure still reading comment would like suggest something constructive manner commenting wasnt able tomnicholas video regardless view self driving car instance say self driving car wont reduce congestion true point stand video cross line term journalistic integrity ask person journalism concur accepted monetary donation company say presenting factbased unbiased video know fact clouding effect topic presented go beyond beyond fact presented video also includes presentation would suggest read given person medium often proving journalistic content responsability viewer publish stuff like least make abundantly clear sponsored video highlighted communicate strong fashion desirable
car overthinking
annoys come anyone praising autonomous car always present driving clear sunny day californian city live north get kind weather condition judge gauge ice snow covering sensor camera also winter road dont even visible line couple week month paint sorry dont see autonomous vehicule dealing lifetime
im going stop driving
saying eyesight good
bring india see happens
michigan legally blind existed cant wait one possibility first state city please let know forward message right people
come autonomous vehicle id worried human driver doesnt matter good driver either take one bad driver crash car
selfdriving car nothing fantasy hype greedy industry wanting profit socalled new trend car never safe unless every city fully new smart road infrastructure even doubt sdv never thing many people playing trendy smart reality follower hanging everything pushed bu way bottle sahara desert sun sell hear someone say wow thats cool
also vehicle road potential communicate making much safer higher
completely support idea software security course biggest problem one project many driverless car sure software data data another point well protected would appreciate someone could explain
dont get wrong love driving made drive amongst others well u car successful creation time still tool used good bad thing think billion death since released autonomous driving doesnt feeling programmed perform task anyways consequence car autonomous serious matter render million people jobless love driving also care neighbor purpose car thanks share keep going
sure heavy rain would affect camera much good england
believe car operate part city well mapped company seems would main restraint adoption pervasion technology

lifetime
really want self driving car want mine shared ride situation always stuff ready go want want though im sure company dont want government insurance company try make cost prohibitive future
think yes could people aboveaverage driver since talking average median take remaining extremely bad driver use public transport instead driverless urban transportation isnt practically sustainable
commercial
driving road lane safe emergency avoid accident driving like dale earnhardt hospital child accident wonder outside box scenario
always awful idea
gross sad
think type vehicle ride shared big city help reduce parking requirement helping traffic wouldnt even mad nyc made manhattan lvl human driver
used avid cyclist whose nerve shot ride share stroad bike pedestrian im
actual biking infrastructure like separated biking path le car overall
would love buy one digital driver would end requirement learn driving selfdriving module car would also kill idea driver seat might car one seat significantly releasing traffic
tusharrao seem super puper smart huh ever knew difference driving public personal transport especially thirdworldcountry live arent aware difference comfort public personal transport
thing mind tho yes would safer every self driving could sync never make mistake thanks new problem get hacked error happens think technology ready people would ruin
thats pointless concern nothing driverless car human nature human effectively searching way ruin everything since starting first fire even look see oven cook food heat source warm cold winter night look see torch throw burn shelter fault fire human
failsafes
tesla view end
never going happen long people late work
repairing vehicle costlier human driver also skill set needed repair preclude mechanic ability thus inability find technician cost ratio create loss scenario purchase vehicle dont believe hype dont swindled snake oil salesman
technology available anyone wouldve free buy use take full responsibility something go wrong know like technology basic knife assault rifle today america feel need regulate everything baby sit citizen like miserable third world country paypal crypto crowdfunding drone anything fly radio based communication isnt licensed network provider list go banned technology hell even alcohol banned certain place make wonder america didnt devolve freedomless country
thinking kill switch passenger seat case
would love information accident specifically pedestrian hitting vehicle guess waymo vehicle made ridiculous hard stop predicting another pedestrian going walk front car like idea autonomous vehicle think human thing vehicle would also love see waymo vehicle handle rush hour nyc heading one tunnel would guess would sit wouldnt aggressive enough move forward traffic
specifically think human better context car course

year say driverless car point time tech think wait time hacked hijacked worse yet used ffs home smart device easiest target guarantee ai driven car also easy target
look driverless car currently deployed non super expensive experimental setup like derek showed almost perfect condition get car dependent suburbia even single issue per mile thats good enough might tolerate every mile even situation moderate amount ambiguity parking lot car hesitated rather unnatural way good enough know whats practical long term solution better designed noncar dependent infrastructure proven work also regarding iot device thats company make employ zero basically zero best practice security measure already deployed device never get updated make super easy hack add bot net possible create secure iot device least secure person using allow

stopped incredibly stupid better mass trans answer driver autonomous vehicle concept engineering sand box swallow comment regarding safety power enforce add teeth law well something constitutional right drive whats word privilege nhtsa strong arm insurance company next impossible license revoked permanently many u foolish technology damned organic idiot create artificial idiot interact w organic idiot lacking psychological maturity point foolhardy nonsense isnt foolproof fool cause problem fatalitiesetc lead litigation set back w technological wonder geeze educated beyond intelligence fueled worry instant gratification look crowd cmon man human race isnt syphisticated enough
area testing infrastructure sign marking well maintained better average miami ft lauderdale live case traffic line faded missing altogether sign missing blocked limb faded missing people stop car block lane meaning approaching vehicle must come sudden stop swerve around hoping one coming direction unfortunately norm reason waymo us phoenix testing ground would work anywhere else one thought ponder many people enjoy driving dont want computer another human driver seat want exhilarating feeling behind wheel king road
nonstop autonomous car developed
trust fully autonomous car even video trust driver either human error big problem also computer dont perception well human
drive selfdriving vehicle without driving license
going outright dislike video seeing title watching whole thing could actually save many life people could even start drinking designated driver would thing past
sad politically strong enough globally many life dont die sad sad
open space office hangardont guy law like window office amount noise
standard perfection rather better average driver weve encountered good average driver
im board kind sad think may car able drive future devastating losing many life road accident generally think limit car use rely train bus lot driverless car last mile city also rural area would inefficient run regular public transport service small community lot seat would wasted need move away notion everybody car incredibly inefficient production maintenance cost emission waste hell lot space even though sad imagine future cant car especially need move away designing city cater everyone get around car instead consider city mode transport public cycling therefore eliminating great deal accident crime
kill whole experience driving
technology good im fine replacing car autonomous car however tgey future traffic traffic isnt future already eliminate traffic also environmentally friendly already remove parking lot dont need fancier tech
think could realistic year reason money average middlelow class citizen cant afford one thing wont matter much wealthy selfdriving car others dont
want tech looked tesla openpilot nontesla vehicle one big issue snow living northeast snow year road crap would like see something show working snowy whiteout condition snowicecovered road sunny state way easy
try car istanbul dhaka dont fail traffic work good moscow without freezing temperature failers think safe enough use
look technology deeming u human worthless stop technology

nah stick one love freedom hate dictatorship propaganda
ok
peanutnerd think still able drive like want given control car away state runned powerhungry facist uegenics psychopath hate freedom see people state propperty using false excuse population run depopulation program long history long history state mankind human right violation
might profitable tesla offer free taxi service one year get people feel comfortable self driving vehicle

beautiful thing driverless car comunicate creating big online map city

working computer since seen number apparently intermittent software issue analysis one truly intermittent result code error combined rarely occurring specific set circumstance first routine wrote machine code susceptible error higher level language couple others caused programming mistake triggered set condition couple created compiler error recent month ago caused parsing one line code valid logically correct possible condition driverless car operated software written many people may ever driven car others may poor driving safety record exceptionally good programmer error considering poor sense responsibility among many human driver remains possible autonomous car could safer
funny thing reaching point human longer write software neural net used tesla literally train vast number variable involved computer vision able understand world around car far large hand coded anyone yes currently c code running top ai order provide software thing neural net learned yet long run entire selfdriving stack group highly tuned neural net generate vectorspace representation world camera image create plan maneuvering environment get user want go manipulate steering pedal signal perfect timing achieve plan
wait car get italian setting
id love know driverless vehicle tesla gathering data also share point like hundred thousand city would announce location vehicle possible issue network make car going way safer feel like waze human driver let driver report potential issue nearly realtime naturally reporting issue whilst driving problematic unless done voice command
human love drive way lol
get safe
good want car company behind want able drive manually wantneed whatever reason
allow auto manual mode keep safety feature active ability communicate another self driving car know input make make sure avoid avoid driving routine
atlesifeyst communication car nono car must complete isolated system prevent hacking
termopilo would hack remote car progress theft maybe car hackable current tech dont seem mind people dont abuse imagine encryption use would standard kind pain as brute force
termopilo meant communication sense distance
driving like horse riding itll still thing sport fun

professional driver driving make living support family saw driverless vehicle made unemployed put family poverty pretty sure driverless vehicle would unfortunate accident think unfortunate accident driverless car would happen often around guess positive newstart plenty spare time hand supply chain break driverless vehicle took due social unrest created unemployment technology wow another driverless vehicle commercial completely ignored social harm technology society
yeah remember elevator operator riot became automated
people always ignore social economic factor becomes driverless car impact driverless vehicle economy many people employed taxi driver truck driver delivery driver bus driver train driver large workforce people suddenly find unemployed find job industry unemployment poverty good think society also driver spend wage economy clearly spending unemployed people considering social impact technology invention going increase unemployment poverty wealth inequality perhaps rethink yet none driverless car company care making rich people richer happy destroy countless life family make company force fully compensate anyone loos livelihood driverless car
labor would replaced gradually way tesla scale production fast enough meet demand soon solved fsd dont worry waymo thay wont level anytime soon
thanks
would also take consideration extra electronic camera need power arent good enviroment recycling themeselves talk million ton material
great video wouldnt compare elevator car car move way direction possibility thing could happen completely crash autonomous car insane human eye anticipation solves complex situation self driving car never programmed deal airplane space ground possible small danger like rock animal could completely stop drive
im fan like driving
taxi job maybe go star work
thats really interesting question came mind know signal dont hurt imagine vehicle autonomous full sensor lidar etc couldnt become issue generating ton electronicalsignal fog really think wealthy people would agree use car anyone else imo would still ton parking lot people like car
pretty sure signal dont cause fog burning fuel
oh mean electrical different band
cinnamonowo agree fuel based vehicle ideal thats point meant lidar doesnt harm thousand car measuring constantly surrounding would health risk would interferes others measurement system etc
biggest issue active system like lidar literally interfere dont see lidar good solution general every car lidar interfere cause problem passive solution like camera dont face issue ultimately work far better matter many selfdriving car
video interesting look like big giant ad
driverless car without lidar bad idea
dont want enslave robot ai like enslaved people u human seem obsession getting something without paying also want delivery job still around keep getting rid lower expertise job people dont want cant obtain expertise umable work higher homeless population
billion mile still able deal easy situation well se ya another billion mile maybe
accident probability kind accident differ human ai situation easy u hard way around
day think im pretty smart also day watch video like
watch channel like way presant scientific evidence long time ago wait read popular science magazine world come far
want able dumbfound police car made type mistake driving also like real robot place behind wheel car impose issue fault way would think interesting could car speaking robot police like kit able sit back enjoy show u imagine amount laugh could cause
u sell cause feeling like lame ad disguised video feel like believed
wrong drift hit
crave new thing open mind
first autonomous ride friend tesla let ride car auto pilot turned went mile sitting behind wheel nothing scary loved
add time wasted due driver driving could something else
boomer
ive long know aircraft pretty advanced regard computer landing plane case taking faith dealt redundant tech id trust autonomous car ad case aircraft pilot case something go wrong
think narrow two type vehicle automated driving manual transmission automatic transmission unless automated entirely
defensive driving
yeah downside million people loose job like people transport business driving truck taxi bus main question automatization car good like shown video train much much easy automate still driver
hahaha also immediate association drone pilot center seeing big hall monitor maybe real autonomous car yet cuz always computer cant go drone pilot take rofl
car security feature automated dont like car made several dangerous decision liek slamming break steam coming manhole cover trying keep lane made rapid maneuver avoid road hazard answer putting trust computer
honest list dont care many people die long taxi driver job control dont care

waymo way experience
one huge advantage selfdriving car human road rage youve driven around someone short temper blow fuse due behavior driver something dumb nonsensical failing read sign properly understanding lane intersection start long emotionless cold calculating machine take wheel

virst vertasun video awful promo vid waymo reasonable example lidar radar modern sensor technology made avaailable human driver advantage sdc youve handwaved trolley problem away cherrypicking rare event argument rare event point worrying right reality judgement choice made many common event driver need great sensor predictabiluty id say sdc mode highway desirable city traffic better job tooled car modher lode waymo need full sdc time away huge workforce overhead delivery drive taxi driver etc
tremendous loss job
im believer autonomous vehicle future time becomes widely available would completely safe extreme scenario would rare take risk daily whether starting engine downloading file catching flight
unless driverless car cure cancer dont want ever whole point drive car enjoy driving experience engaging vehicle autonomous transit individuality cause much might get annoyed slow old people id much rather experience see year old die tesla crash cause cant run away insanely high heat fire created burning laptop battery theyre sitting

ironically video totally convinced automated car safe made even convinced solution issue raised every large scale problem mentioned traffic congestion accident lack green space effectively solved public transportation pedestrian friendly urban planning even youre solving problem youre replacing parking lot customer owned car depot full selfdriving car stored waiting use youre replacing congestion human driven sovs congestion machine driven sovs environmentally friendly human friendly solution doesnt feel like improves quality life real measurable way compared alternative
think miss bigger picture lot traffic congestion caused human error driving fast slow accident autonomous vehicle like would actually help congestion people cant afford car dont make lot money end using car car act like public transportation drive several people predict future company running car push riding price low people would buy car driving experience rather daily commuting make sense people use price wait go way people use car instead driving would definitely help environment computer help planning route efficiently
bthdk bigger picture public transportation sustainable urban planning already system place around world provide solution describing gracefully le waste car would produce single occupancy vehicle never going efficient solution car exceptionally poor solution problem thats already got answer
think everyone agrees public transport better touch expect work everywhere land united state totally rural ive never seen system work well outside city plus ton already know public better still use car regardless mind well reduce damage
bthdk know people actually use vehicle
falsum based utilization uber lyft without driver people like dont feel nervous whether driver creep rape thing getting used driven robot took people get used elevator without human operator happen

literally happened long ago guy driverless car killed people crash he hook manslaughter sure let push driverless car
many good argument driverless car one sure theyre perfect sometimes kill people normal car kill people probably much often
whole video advertisement like watching coca cola commercial telling benefit fizzy sugary drink everyone need drink right
thats certainly irrelevant however sporadically watched channel year id suspect derek wouldve made similar video without sponsorship id say likely happy video take sponsorship time still much alley
isnt like cocacola vast amount data supporting safety record driverless car veritasium take much money possible he helping save people life
maybe
archvaldor maybe didnt run people darker skin tone lmao
protercool take sponsorship there conflict interest perceived actual content video cast doubt
try one thing cairo trafic
cant take money corporate sponsor promote sponsor product information expect taken seriously moment opened corporate checkbook way lost credibility know far better science exists truth allowed flourish made video space technology sponsored shaving cream company would fine producing paid video company product calling video science nonstarter
fun game nut hack fifty car run stock exchange potential problem tech
used cruise control since seventy way ever able better fuel economy carefully thought machineelectronics easily outperform designer bring driverless car
wonder car place like india thailand
one thing still perplexes hacker taking control vehicle given moment
self driving car cool nicer live city never need car
video sponsored waymo dont forget mary led
reminded vedio year driverless car
think vedio isnt honest
yeah yeah million mile experience happens dont give flying f level autonomy
okay driverless car great right there chance getting real solution ultimately relying heavily car transportation insanely inefficient
imagine massively better would instead today humancar ratio fully close shared car system like derek state time car parked wasting space material money instead building many car co footprint car lifetime come building damn thing would use one needed since sharing vehicle could also riding way better car one could afford dangerous part car could removed since longer need drive list go would le need huge road space could transformed railway
mrfedericoaa ever hear public transportation way could build city much efficiently need car
eslofftschubar true public transit solves without leaving thing behind
eslofftschubar train also electric year fully autonomous nearly year need spend year developing complex system
ravenclawgamer exactly
veritasium regard criticism video would like express majority siding behalf surprisingly would like use thought behalf secondary support criticism short celebrity like idolization prominent figuressuch self shouldnt come key factor self exposure information fact checking said previously attempting prove opposite expect believe science although must admit many case im scientist brings joy hope seeing life video etc please continue derek veritasium
someone daily commute time year form weather yes go place norwegian fjord driven eastern white coast spain way norwegian midland coast would confidence suggest sooner driverless vehichles become norm better sheer quantity people world legally drive motorized vehicle ammount clearly abstain due sheer callous carelessness lack practical skill physical condition hamper ability percieve happening around really begin outweight public fear autonomous car
mrlolstorm suspect already driverless car better people overall problem like flying gun people like putting fate hand even hand statistically dangerous
taxi driver truck driver bus driver want right freedom violated sure
people think aboveaverage driver think considering awful driver ive seen skew mean downwards insane degree id actually say check
thats math work
general like video veritasium uploads advertorial fall category
dude know watch video right remember bit flip video say backup car prevent situation
sponsored video scripted promo know google youtube waymo ask autonomy theme park ride safety sensor never detected single sign corner etc preprogrammed one ride talk issue due customer eula google required tesla crash video within promo video waymo got approval due donating government waymo requires intervention officer always within min drive vehicle hit rough patch malfunction also many accident done rd party insurance company googlewaymo never sued massive complaint crash record made public unlike company like rivian tesla modded outlander autonomy waymo zoox cruise etc
think would trust driverless car would trust human driver course dont trust driver anyway big step
guy never seen glitch
wonder year winner driverless car oems eventually develop future company like waymo many many others develop fully next year dominate market everyone want tech fully fleshed widespread cvx change life forever
airplane land self there lot le plane lot airspace road space people correct equipment see everyone around
scariest thing car emergency brake
ride crash waymo send driverless ambo
driverless car pose huge future political problem eventually corporationsgovernments try strip people right drive drive using tried true technique fear mongering money control car people buy service use get around youll richer amazon
saving million life know ethic problem might happen every x year might lead choice human would also issue deal
selfflying plane ever selfdriving car thats happening anytime soon
driverless car need steering wheel dashboard
tech isnt perfected may still need emergency takeover like said video level autonomy quite level yet
shreyanshdhakad hows going take control backseat
johnnyblue idk there support thing call people maybe emergency stop car get front
shreyanshdhakad oh alright stupid computer go berserk bird poop camera car run red light guy going call support really
johnnyblue chill tech isnt ready completely yet become pretty damn good far development tech like
nice ad really like video making enough money assume regular video undescribed
city ton cyclist go whatever want red green side road pavement suddenly road left right ev concede
let go ai honestly wouldnt mad one inherited earth theyd better job especially human werent get way
im happy peaceful ride destination shared stress human driver passenger obligation talk entertain cab driver thats full day peaceful relaxing ride point point b thats every ride
isnt lidar restrictive
sick rude cab driver motorist hopped hard drug making road dangerous ever robot answer dont smoke meth drive get road rage
im excited fully autonomous vehicle
make road safer yes want see one day car moving second light turned green instead second
feel like majority car general could removed designed city town better make walking cycling andor taking reliable public transit need order get one place another
funny scientist came conclusion
eslofftschubar way said right possible however due global warmimg issue making much difficult deal
uzbekistan agree bother car pushed matter mean propulsion still car drawback city built around car would order magnitude greater advantage switching electric self driving car
wow invented amsterdam
locky denver
excited self driving car idk like driving car mostly fast standard
fully autonomous car imagine enormous drop death highway road u form death year hundred imagine gridlock traffic jam stupid anxietyprovoling driver rage incident stupid brake checking people drive road people going create problem autonomous vehicle way forward biggest problem course hacking lack concern national level cyber hacking ridiculous instead spending billion plane need spend billion protecting internet know many state want little duchy day would hard probably cause lot pushback ignorant people unfortunately safety everyone theyd get used
still steering wheel
car something cute
sure safe get cabin rock crawl
happens park hood someone put screwdriver thru one camera lidar sensor get home
park still thinking car
silly replace car better infrastructure public transit want safer commute never solution complex driving
came tom nicholas video thanks scientific propaganda earned another unsubscribe hope spent money wisely thank video best luck future
problem see regulation accident occurs autonomus veihcle blame
love feel like incredibly important technology minnesota last winter alone nearly accident
terrible yes also something solved better infrastructure le car dependence netherlands good example build better decrease crash absolutely use technology car make le dangerous everyone theyre le likely kill infrastructure designed prevent crash mitigate one happen even better would ensuring people dont drive everywhere first place
almost like root problem car
car sitting idle thats mass public transport car
hardly bag lady cart get run month
wake elite trying replace u
driving test india passwhich never happen pre assume good enough could never surpass human one created
simple enough understand way many idiot road young old driving fast neighorhoods duis distracted driving cell phone texting etc speed limit isnt fast enough scene victim people need controlled cant control
uk recent proposal driver would absolved responsibility accident blame allocated car manufacturer seems reasonable principle make car affordable apart extra cost technology manufacturer build enough contingency funding price cover accident claim entire lifespan car ie basically adding decade third party insurance liability front car cost cant see financial model working
car got spooked guy corner good thing nobody driving behind
year ago good article published guardian titled driverless car willing kill save life others provides compelling counter argument everything said advertvideo
human driver cause million car accident every year u alone think laypeople focus far much accident expect happen yet one primary goal selfdriving car prevent accident ever occurring first place funny thing human wont even notice said prevention vast majority time accident prevention exciting car suddenly performing precise maneuver avoid collision vast majority accident prevention come car dumb enough put bad situation first place car eye back head never get distracted sleepy intoxicated always performs maneuver safely rather choosing speed cut people tailgate etc like human selfdriving car caused even x fewer accident human literally societal benefit get many road possible right away guess cant see doesnt happen medium focus small percentage accident happen rather honest fact selfdriving car already reducing accident rate every single day
really like video video wrong information need clarified pilot called low visibility operation regulated land plane using either autopilot hud low visibility operation start depending runway visual range day kind weather pilot choose whether want use autopilot regrettably company promote hand flying pilot happens pilot anymore confident flying plane depend autopilot time landing san francisco beautiful weather pilot cockpit pilot flying zero thrust lever realize auto throttle hold mode late tried correct due inertia plane impossible real small thing nothing serious pilot hold pilot confident flying plane even need functional auto throttle flight director nowadays loosing real pilot cockpit handle autopilot malfunction ease getting system operator rely much autopilot
question happens sudden power connectivity failure within vehicle affect sensor camera
car would come stop however thats lot le likely happen human making mistake
im sure like industry worked autonomous driving system university thing pretty high level redundancy system sensor processor substitute calculation wired different circuit even within system close impossible everything fail unless thing get nuked case bigger problem worry even budget small sized student designed hacked together one university thing quite resilient imagine one made hardened engineer industry watchful eye distrustful policy maker probably im longer space could remember car positioning youd gps lidar camera feeding calculation system start drop still multiple full system used basically get perfect position data literally everything decided fail status heartbeat still much update predict heading quite accurately even without system forever empty space made thing stop fallback know within reason use last known position prediction thing around find safe place stop likely worstcase scenario might require failure majority disparate system would scared logic bug hardware failure
sponsored waymo common man kidding youve lost credibility
point driverless car put people work sure point
assuming video truthful point would obviously safer convenient
zthecat lol
johnsmithzvkm lolol
zthecat computer waaaaaaay le likely make dumb mistake human computer cant get drunk computer wont run neighbor dog computer wont crash car next lane human stop looking road second respond text saying car replaced convinient
kaidoust assuming computer system made well course video biased many truth video also many thing doubt put much thought
great presentation really interested video
decision make time im driving see car trouble staying lane assume driver distractedtexting careful around car road narrow maybe wait pas give little room quickly ill avoid driving alongside car car tailgating aggressively ill predict car going try pas maybe cut dangerously ill keep closer eye give little space autonomous car make use kind data recognizing driver likely cause accident theyre distracted hostile changing decision could imagine ai could seems like important safety feature
good point practice observation enable improve safety dozen signal derive tiny detail without even thinking automatic agree question different selfdriving car going act like gentleman road picture city street sidewalk pedestrian walk big pond rain accumulated along curb proper driver except arrogants slows swerve order splash people muddy water selfie car going cut across water unchanged speed causing justified rage potential serious loss stained clothes pedestrian imagine take wife restaurant elegantly dressed get back home made wet head toe dirty water splash driverless car understand behave
yes believe waymo car exactly look much car wander around beyond lane presume car higher variability movement account ie behave cautiously dont think look inside car see driver distracted vague sense cyclist pedestrian identify way human looking include prediction likely future path one big difference see waymo car patient think car likely wander lane theyll keep holding back safe pas human eventually get grumpy accelerate past glaring driver
yes tailgating car slow make emergency stop tailgating car enough time stop hitting annoys hell theyre usually already annoyed safe thing tailgating car slow right thats autonomous vehicle end drive like autonomous vehicle teaching u drive
flip side distracted driver instead replaced driverless car wouldnt even problem car meant replace bad driver
look machine learning completely change look everythingtech
dont trust model based simpson episode
concern human becoming even le skill driver automation ridding automated car like riding passenger essentially thing keep driving skill updated contrary
sorry sponsored waymo mean immediate cancellation downpeg credibility doubt much video highlighted even mentioned waymo work walled garden street sign curb pothole meticulously mapped must continually remapped account change also million mile training mere pittance needed full autonomy
project fail saudi arabia lol
wait minute telling robot control road vehicle drive cliff determine hight diameter rock
many camera
im concerned loss able drive pleasure driving get car sickness im driving horrible someone like
everything take away dont let
well mean give option drive tesla dont want auto pilot
driving fun literally like keeping lane hitting thing front completely boring usually stressinducing allwheel drive model fun drive let driving bother take limited scenario actually fun many car around take track people enjoy driving still able visit closed course race really want ultimately driving huge waste humanity time honestly many aspect society ultimately waste time long run robot handle mundane nonsense focus stuff truly matter
like still climb stair instead taking elevator youd still able drive manually
dont care ban car
many problem autonomous car rain drop fog faded line road sticker graffiti sign knocked dysfunctional traffic light etc
weapon war example old tank converted autonomous old fighter converted autonomous
thanks auto insurance company fighting technology thanks valuing stockholder profit human life
careful buying one selfdriving automobile though buddy bought one missed making payment month car drove back dealership
waymo vehicle going eliminate parking lot vehicle going leave hospital drive back home

really god
read title thought yes mine love driving
autonomous vehicle manufacturer want truly stress test software go drive lagos delhi throw new york couple place promise nigeria india alone break car car cry
would car need fuel run battery powered either way assuming people adapt idea self driving car used globally hence abandoning car need driver idea people would driverless car people careless charging fueling car would car stop middle road fuel source run instance car busy freeway run charge fuel would stop driving may cause car hit another car hit something get hit another car case wouldnt potentially cause accident mean human nature get comfortable get careless thing isnt necessarily unlikely scenario right
sheldons gon na love
hmm one feel like long ad waymo usually video make think one feel like im told think kinda unsettling wondering othet video laden sponsored content
one reason ive wanted decade could potentially sleep traveling somewhere good friend several hour drive away driverless car could set friday night wake saturday morning spend weekend set home sunday night im ready bed perspective journeying would happen asleep would almost though travel instantaneous

good note airplane dont land complex habitat city street
idea fullyautonomous car even street legal yet make nervous autonomous car thing like panic stop pedestrian obviously going walk front car random unnecessary maneuver like cause nearby car collide autonomous car something illogical unpredictable said human terrible driver cellphone improved safety feature car really dont pay attention think safer really thus drive recklessly even though dont fully trust autonomous car might honestly prefer modern driver start think id really interested car react bad weather venture guess doubt theyd fair well snow ice traction vehicle physic nonstandard unpredictably inconsistent travel road also find somewhat unbelievable well ever get point car driverless people like driving continue matter government intervention take nonautonomous car road would probably also met quite resistance car people
second thought tom nicholas made amazing video titled veritasium story youtube propaganda hate educational youtubers get paid something present fact spend time skeptical watching nowadays kid watch channel like would think downside would still continue argue vehicle still long time hit road said still love veritasium continue watch till end time
near future sure year really think car people even exist feel like people drive car closed track designated area similar horse
jdagriffs honestly im sure feel like resulted horse buggy taken road sheer speed difference car there new technology available allows travel four time faster youre probably going switch whether convenience sheer terror run transition driverless car isnt quite big leap coexist humanoperated car much better car coexist horse im sure something eventually completely replace current style car think itll something significantly different selfdriving car
nonameikdu cant agree le
nonameikdu interesting thought may right think something efficientfasterbetter car mechanical sense come along autonomous driving perfected correct think case underlying mechanic roadcar stay car drive completely obsolete human driven car maximum couple hundred year technology fully mature proven timeline would guess full autonomous takeover happens much faster year guess happens year
better vote high speed rail system
show autonomous driving km india without driver city like mumbai
big issue car safer safer law maker change law around accident happen car fully autonomous car hit another car pedestrian blame driver actually driving manufacturer issue solved see wide adoption tech government body allow
ask clown feel wrong self driving car grid like long way think coming expect wont
take least year come india year red tape year r year become popular road much terrible india
driverless bus le car bus even driver behind wheel driverless car still take much space
aint never taking key away
driverless car make traffic worse induced demand eliminate vehicular death way reduce traffic robust public transportation
great commercial
kill loud music youre talking
informative ad scientific video would need include least expert traffic scientist study basic principle driverless car pro con used technology head company make money selfdriving car
thats veratasium got paid make video sponsored driverless car company
jaakaart plenty lie omission video dont know isnt unscientific
jaakaart id never claim someone lying presenting theory unless presented fact regardless im claiming veritasium made conscious choice omit information video wouldve clashed sponsor video wanted issue isnt information left clearly video going information autonomous vehicle issue video entirely uncritical assessment parroting flimsy best statistic info provided company sponsoring backed cited source going present video educational youtube channel channel named latin truth dont get trim known negative technology video escape criticism couldve easily done kind video theranos talking revolutionary tech going change healthcare forever never mentioning didnt get see machine action

adhe little better job properly disclosing thatalso ofcourse driverless car work optimal condition problem road arent optimal sure arent predictable enough car autonomous thats one thing mixture autonomous semi autonomous old school car road time seems like bad idea
would responsible car hit either pedestrian motorcycle another car also responsible injury incur hit something also take available purchase problem dependent one car available lot time run errand stop home commuting dont work home vehicle usage errand pleasure also mean running errand want stop lunch unless car wait stuff would unloaded problem even rideshare vehicle cant spur moment change drive one thing driverless car dont become limited want detour go offroading example
ever heard tesla
dont mean knock pretty cool wouldnt lot danger cyberlevel also feel train public transport kind make little le impressive one giant engine carrying bunch people seems better efficiency safety environment
self driving bus got perfect combination
alphacarinae yeah tell singapore
train best transportation method eternity half yet cant defeat join improve
alphacarinae le freedom le safety government control let get tin foil hat flat earth tshirt please
alphacarinae im entirely sure safety part youre going coming pardon im wrong wouldnt wellsustained train system work like time car mean plane essentially airtrains seem pretty good mentally unstable drug issue due society large public transport campaigning thing yeah sure nuclear energy way go
push driverless car sham aim taking away personal freedom travel people believe marxist ideology mean control
agree whole concept video concern happens everyone forgets drive whole aspect operating vehicle becomes completely obsolete kind scary thought
probably always people enjoy driving vehicle fun
quick question know ride horse even people dont completely unnecessary current society thing happen car dont trust selfdriving car first wait year computer ai get exponentially faster every year selfdriving car able thing couldnt even dream accident thing past u alone million car accident annually vast majority caused human error computer would simply never make
yeah people said thing computer nobody know use typewriter look
future reduced death reduced job perfect combination humanity
wonder happens dozen road wouldnt laser reflection picked vehicle would communicate make sure none using frequency
lost video watched channel thought provoking theme video waymo commercial instead objective analysis driverless car got one sided video truly infomercial future driverless car sure however delivered misleading stats waymo marketing talking point potentially cool video turned time life wont get back
many uber driver say theyve dreamed driving billion mile
cant wait use marseille time park camera go
always making future dystopia look entertaining thanks veritasium
simply take bus max driver per people drive also heavy fograinsnow building site marking correct temporarily overwritten tbh care taxi driver moment selfdriving car available purchase unfinished beta version
im sure said one thing would worried hacking vehicle causing accident
noone doubt sensor sharper human sens difference elevatorsairplanes car ofc traffic two dumb argument right car going close emergency braking front guy walking side road tell really need know computer situational awareness human get distracted careless doubt also drive situation since autopilot better human pilot almost century still use human maybe ring bell thats traffic free enviroment
prefer self driving car think tech adoption make difficult automated car alongside human never work human emotional erratic see phased approach lane dedicated autonomous car glorious day road made self driving car
driving kinda fun tho
take away human road put robot driverless car believe safe even one human dont want self driving car maybe future comment seen troll living present opinion
shouldnt want want theyre ready
one problem auto driving car see there always large portion people live mountain require powerful vehicle human navigate dirt muddy rocky snowy road issue electric car
think fair say really large portion people live mountain according estimate american live urban suburban area
understand ironic watched video say truly better average driver year experience driving heavy delivery vehicle accident year speedhing ticket year leave ton space car front enjoy driving whether correct still say could snap finger tomorrow wake world car fullyautomated elevator would gladly would safer still make stupid mistake sometimes random chance one seriously hurt mistake wrong place wrong time
think different definition make good driver many would say includes fast like car race think like driving save within speed limit getting speeding ticket important point beeing good driver dont speed know speed camera
totally see next year every privelge good driver going aspect luxury general public forced use autonomous vehicle gatekeeping performance
think problem lot people like drive manually guessing eventually thing done race track offroad car ownership average person unknown guess rent car pick take work holiday drive serve someone else bad thing would hate see driving something listed history book something people used extinct pastime rich enjoy hobby
reason driverless car wont really take trustsafety
aint truth bruh talkin bout academic paper published waymo veritas as deceitful lost respect keep dodgin tom reply smh
veritas sponsored objective youve sold company youre analysing veritasium another disappointment among many yt
traffic accident ticket got life age im forty havent ticket year havent collision year clearly wanted make road safer dont let young male drive lol
want add greater degree safety road eliminate traffic accident fatality well make illegal male age drive make vast majority traffic fatality dont know drive theyre idiot take needle risk really cared safety wouldnt let people drive mids
anyone who driven professionally like youve driven life get point become psychic tell way car behaves driver make move front learned long time ago never trust someone turn signal tell car front way car driving behavior driver ever develop computer powerful enough thats sensitive enough wasting car used military purpose lol
minute long waymo commercial lol
type message google talk text working want trust life technology lol lol lol lol
car dangerous must banned
environmental influence like weather lidar system sensor challenging guess rainfall raindrop sensor snow icing lidar fog dew sensor changing temperature humidity like driving tunnel one lidar system one car interferring anothers car lidar system
amazing robotics make life easy comfortable today driverless car humanless city finally one day dream would came true lifeless earth happy future
think reason feel strange lack ofcontrol trusting driver dont trust driver need assume something silly issue trusting thisif autonomous id feel safer
real question iswhat tip leave tip driverless taxi ride cheap people dont tip need reply
plane crash inspected long figure prevent future much plane crash need car full self driving
need imagine smooth driving would anyone killed driving would bcuz non autonomous car
ive always admired veritasum video watched independent opinion question derek thought something wrong would video sponsored waymo assume aprove right write script ask
actually video discussing possible problemo
thedanielradio video post link
hardo vague use word filter comment section never show wouldnt expect veritasium team know
thedanielradio thx u know veriatium video self driving car sponsored german car brand think many comment ad anymore
hardo saw veritasium video self driving car year ago havent seen one meant sad hear sponsored one sponsored video shouldnt disliked remain contious bias preferably educational youtubers still make sure weigh side argument
come india see u shouldnt want driverless car road
technology know driving car
evry car like wouldnt accident cause would coordinated one faynally solution accident road
already tested san francisco recently least hundred waymos around city
introvert n v e
yeah fun game car take hostage youre suddenly board container ship way aralon
ban car self driving
best video ive seen year oh wait day gon na
im south africa driver pointing passenger seat thumbnail
hear lot problem human driver endless problem posed fully autonomous vehicle software possibly controlled big tech company even loss privacy loss technical skill censorship cyber attack car loss job software upgrade possibly opted every citizen owns aircraft elevator assume citizen automated car future mandated order travel see mobile phone app like tiktok algorithm shape mind generation people better seen tip iceberg great technology would truly believe would awesome help elderly etc also know there whole part iceberg hidden beneath surface people pretending doesnt exist
totally ad waymo id prefer something unbiased
outstanding video self driving car cant arrive soon enough
whole video advertisement waymo like watching coca cola commercial telling benefit fizzy sugary drink everyone need drink right
jimmyzhao could unlike pop huge benefit self driving car
even today best auts judge could quite reasonably ask person driving seat aut crash car selfdriving system please explain court taken aut driving car crash happened statistic show aut generally better driving human
blatant ad want tough situation try selfdriving offmap rally route parking lot showed actually stupid system compared human ai selfdriving assistance still need map preprogrammed roadsigns gps data still main reason like missingcovered roadsigns weather condition missed question like system memorize human behaviour react adhoc move human differentiate moron driver complex situation
saddest thing world watching hero sell
f give
one legally blind
ready car drive everywhere ill first line become affordable
""
sooner think robotaxis going soo cheap everyone going use
pure advert
something great
love idea auto pilot car physical override option outlier case software glitch happen people hack system fun people find hilarious cause accident etc
course
eliminate demonsterably unlikely chance using separate computing unit running identical software like one derek even showed video bit flip one make mistake three others overrule even extend car road one car behaving irrational way signal working compute unit correct behavior shouldnt let happen deterent fully autonomus veichle especially human error vastly dangerous chance hacker kid going bit crazy
ready autonomous vehicle reduce traffic death half people grabbing wheel burning getting parking space hot rodding traffic causing accident drunk driver killing people car dont kill human human kill human

see also cgp grey human need apply
got almost everything airplane wrong plane full auto land separation landing plane time greater manually landing result time le capacity landing traffic therefore landing manual full auto land used low visibility procedure
also whole process using automated landing plane still involves direct effort many people automated much like driverless car wouldnt think
also flying instrument thing pilot lot
automated landing safe rougher passangers pilot judge flare create gentle touchdown computer doesnt furthermore automated landing precision instrument landing used lot aid determine correct glideslope runway unless going add precision navigation equipment every road never achieve level automation car exactly waymo level therefore geofenced travel well mapped controlled environment take waymo car drop let say berlin car wouldnt able navigate safely doesnt know city
hansgbmv precisely lot place google mapsearth area live included dont trust car stay undefined gravel road let alone navigate properly
hansgbmv unless going add precision navigation equipment every road dont need navigation equipment car map city slowly stored network access travel well mapped controlled environment waymo level therefore geofenced controlled environment see part car able detect thing far away meter geofenced youre saying everything hasnt already prepared innovation wont work logicrule nothing new would ever implemented everything set perfectly preinvention wed extinct
really interest point imagine get actually trust mind reasoning technology probably quite trustworthy accurate probably superior human many way something terrifies edit im massive fan waze app think itd super cool car automatically know stuff like waze use user data help kiss obstacle accident traffic jam etc much information helpful probably prevents quite lot accident imagine car auto adjust surroundings using data whether source strictly gps satellite etc data thats sourced user mix
never hear waze there good vid youtube look great thanks tip
id like hear kissing obstacle
unless waymo operated fully autonomous vehicle northern wisconsin winter infinitely larger amount experience snowy road
dont understand developing passengershumans didnt military pioneer technology trucksstuff arent focused shipping tractor trailer long interstate controlled environment isnt money
driverless remotely controlled driveroperatormonitor
obviously program car hit cyclist without helmet promote wearing helmet
nah drive standard bmw like driving ill stick opposed wef want humanity thx
he right illegal anyone drive vehicle without month driver course commoner forbidden driving safety good everyone autonomous car mandated world live likely scenario
wait drive honestly one worst part day extremely glad rid
violated covid law forcing return home vehicle fine imprison
happens situation someone run infront car enough time stop car approaching oncoming lane mother pushing pram sidewalk isnt immoral let computer decide kill human would try avoid harming anyone often end dead would computer kill passenger
cant wait car world everyones using wonder like taxi replace personal vehicle second one right would best cant wait car like
missing robot driver break away like movie
problem video sponsored waymo see pinch salt

drive far better stupid robot
comment tell entire life never anything remotely scientific topic academic level
video sponsored north vpn
still concern like privacy car need lot info thing collect info work whats stop someone using tool collect info hackproof doubt also ownership able fully car pay corporation subscription keep software running updated illegal mod
privacy day bother read legal disclosure find say sell data hack proof found air software update doubt update stop year old car become obsolete buy new one kind like apple modding probably void legal protection good idea get accident responsible get accident think still worked
forget better like driving best world ie car autonomous youre tired drive want fun
inevitably future opinion
currently working transport industry driver anything need start expanding skill diversify work job class work might come end near future least developed country much like elevator driver past
rile antiautonomous vehicle crowd
good awesome technology ill job year
fault human part life driving pleasure right place supposed taxi guy selling future every move monitored fine driverless elevator big deal even plane co dont know im going im plane spying movement individual
well someone financing car loan didnt pay bill couple month driving company lolz
event accident driverless car fault happen blame occupant manufacture
car proven fault way sue occupant company
like driving car would trust car operates autonomously without someone else office able reroute reason want car
exactly im accident dont want computer something retarded could mistake oversight made programmer sensor malfunction even cosmic ray make computer go haywire ironically veritasium actually made video latter phenomenon veritasium sellout hack hate seeing clickbait video pop
driverless car would make easy someone carjack would merely stand front car car would obediently stop partner could walk beside start smashing window crowbar car would still obediently sit want charge destiny want decide car driving want merely captive audience sitting inside car controlling technological thing taking control life last thing would spend thousand dollar buy something complete control life
literally solved simple emergency system car let take example hit ermegency button happen hit carjacker need court justify emergency situation
better average human eventually time self driving vehicle broadly deployed would order magnitude safer best human
couple decade away thing reliable enough practical
another video great resetasium
love vehicle question moment people dont wander across road without looking know there enough bad driver wont see run happen vehicle autonomous guaranteed stop pedestrian wont vehicle transit time significantly reduced people cross road ever want without looking
problem solution dont asshole
easy solution every car radius honk shun jaywalker create social stigma trafficblocker

im going hell laughing hard
duis would thing past

good video wouldve preferred didnt conflict interest
cyberpunk getting stuff stolen driverless taxi
cool could helpful many important thing accomplish putting million perhaps billion dollar something dont really need put money brain solving problem like plastic ocean global climate change battery power density
tech cant hit road mass commercial scale soon enough want see driver become obsolete theyll banned law want yesterday
id love see blind experiment people given ride either humandriven autonomous end ride rate ride guess whether driver
really good test autonomous vehicle follow every rule road person know human thats assuming thorough experiment many human driver
dannygjk nah id say chance get correct especially told start since dont think peapol remember every rule road propaply run autopilot whit rule feal like main thing would get notice smoothness ride since human wont make perfect turn unlike computer
mrbattlecats pay attention whether people follow rule tee never known driver follow every rule another thing keep mind test would secret kept human driver otherwise might change driving habit

live boca raton
notice make one two small error every day drive major error might caused accident twice year fully autonomous car available would buy one could get rid problem human error seem
another thing always keep mind secure brain car adversary control car could potentially harm
yes please
selfdriving car dont perform well lessthanperfect weather condition ice snow rain muddy road sensor get clogged
car absolutely life saver russia russian woman busy make driving
incredible
youll also le privacy commuting
year ago told driverless tech would take next year
year ago serious prediction estimatated self driving would take short time
want driverless car road sponsorship thanks interested
reduced fatality sure would cautious prediction reduce traffic improve commute interstate highway system supposed yet made driving much easier result expanded car usage match people willing live mile worked huge network autonomous car might serve suck people public transit encourage take longer longer commute work course there question would disrupt economy professional driver replaced machine
thanks tom debunking video
wdym
iplaygames go watch tom nicholas veritasium youll know man supposed headline already know corporates favor youtuber youtube give green light viewership aside watch tom die hard veritasium fan watched video
cupofjoen ill give watch thanks
iplaygames let know reaction reaction mind blowing opening
much convoluted logic still reduce accident putting feature car driver thats exactly whats happening problem computer even close seeing well human many aspect vision replace car autonomous car talk create perfectly safe road lose whole driving experience
tech scaledutilized without increasing overall co emission besides obvious benefit earliersafer arrival ai vehicle supposed reduce congestion account co emission usa hearing loud lydar system sounded seeing necessary support facility could full scale adoption autonomous vehicle actually raise co emission certainly hope
factory used robot forklift stood factory floor whizzed around u commented felt vulnerable guide stepped front one stopped sensor beamed thought safety brake table saw one demonstrate trying cut hot dog saw stop fast hot dog skin even broken dont people demonstrate sticking hand saw safest car world would car driver actually paying attention road like table saw safest operator healthy fear getting hurt
thanks talking also providing data doubt everyone would use driverless itll safer everyone particularly road well maintained
video make clear know first hand year resident chandler arizona vehicle operating exceptionally limited context eastern boundary service area along mcqueen road moved year mile claim logged covering road using substantial sensor array time seen single van run around without driver video first instance spent substantial time near waymo depot addition watching drive around city year hand ive rented tesla model fsd beta enabled entire week used drive around northern virginia area attentive waymo vehicle knew zero ability get involved aside asking vehicle stop tesla actually allowed relax bit knowledge still could take need considering cost ive seen far waymo would make sense unless writing infrequently unless team pull secret weapon would pull george elon right yet missed bigger picture hard imagine waymo able provide service enough area ever relevant especially compared tesla already capable continuously growing fleet vehicle around world
year almost bug car gone literally much safer use car rather driving car
million mile experience bet would find error loophole within one day figure least deadly situation within week within two week would find deadly situation would easily preventable human driver impossible prevent software
going way head video veritasium problem automated driving isnt knowledge lack knowledge say human overestimating skill well give confidence automated driving wasnt tested real world problem arent one overestimating safety think camera make change well guess dont know human still better recognizing shape object camera software automated driving become safe testing real world problem extensive time big sample driver condition problem get condition initially people die dont compare car plane please would die amount difference could say producer take responsibility wouldnt see wont take responsibility everything power make software run car user take responsibility
answer simple payed video
thanks derek great informative video hope pessimistic technology becomes widespread
stupid commercial company sponsored video informative implies also presenting disadvantage letting decide
scope driver le vehicle critical factor associated future uptake hoi pollloi firstly people like drive bro twisty road cruising bit road rage angry among uswhatever like ou fait design detail would assume logic incorporated control system deal high level utter stupidity ego ubiquitous long deep experience automotive industry taking account manufacture past history glitch poor quality material manufacture bad design latterly low longevity wouldnt feel safe
amused happily want throw away individuality private ownership compare incredibly overengineered aeroplane landing system oh perhaps zillion car india poor road heavy monsoon rain lidar radar system nothing like good enough sheep rushing cliff veritasium lead
still russian ladas
reason fully automated car good traffic vehicular manslaughter drunk driving car insurance road rage possible bad thing hacker computer glitch minimal
changing one kind car another reduce traffic
would love driverless car work requires ridiculous amount driving would love let car drive sleep
number critical injury every year requiring hospital stay doctor visit medication year due auto accident probably far greater number number death ten thousand people still medication going doctor visit due auto accident involved year ago think much autonomous vehicle would reduce health care cost time north america alone
total nonsense
jesus king know jesus savior please pray jesus save moment choose faith gave life rose dead defeated death even though meant die surrendered life chose surrender life forgive jesus god amen jesus love much please accept love encourage read bible pray god loved world gave one begotten son world whoever belief shall perish eternal life john jesus enough tell jesus love god belief believe trust thank
driverless vehicle would work optimally car driver wouldnt comfortable riding one sharing road mixture incompetent overconfident majority small number okay driver small minority actively dangerous crazy even though illogical simply hate control dont feel comfortable elevator plane riding pillion behind motorcyclist know competent experienced car become much safer last decade driver actually gotten le competent time distracted point longer feel safe riding bicycle motorcycle anymore
sure someone waymo watching data driving car distance
everything supposed get cheaper nothing ever get cheaper still waiting cheap electricity promised decade ago
advertisement scientific video shame
booooo video garbage doesnt acknowledge real issue driverless car
people drive car somehow appeal variety natural instinct become robot people hate ban scrap find new toy
like driving also autopilotautoland autonomous driving similar theyre semiautonomous everything else different basically zero overlap needed respective technology work well
sorry deric dont see driverless vehicle ever taking area many dirt road snow lot winter top people like enjoy driving would thoroughly displeased longer allowed drive
true possible good maintained road good weather condition want see someone testing selfdrived car narrow curvy road dark still rainig day
getting autonomous vehicle like lining experimental vaccine influenza
sponsored highly uncritical video blight thought great platform promoting science service big business driverless car hype prolong dead end individual mass transport
want india best situation test practical situation
like tech dont like possibility government decide force car provider shut vehicle limit people drive like freedom
see driverless car kill pedestrian mad scramble every manufacturer distributor transporter designer engineer installer dealer software programmer etc every single part car blame fault accident every single part subassembly assembly system sensor camera computer wiring harness detector program etc car except mad scramble try explain interconnected part working together show part actually responsible contributing accident actually part working concert another assembly part actually led accident really part fault entire circus go round round round court year year year back forth back forth everyone blaming everyone else finally relative person killed witness dead gone whole legal mess disappear slowly forgotten never ever even settled
love word veritasium
lol elevator v driverless car youre ok head
video ride motorcycle street around waymos
ive heard news predicting wed majority full autonomous car year since optimistic
fair paid make video obviously hed act optimistic product advertising
drive snow ice
found odd people almost never point massive improvement urbanization consequential overall improvement quality life hat autonomous car would enable
truck plane train boat ferry cargo ship basically job existence automated increase quality people come fundamental clash crapitalism somehow employment direct correlation system actual reality belief system
stupid crap expensive average person want would never trust automated driving sue get hurt another super rich corp afford get everyone screwed cause money cultism
average person could afford
got dam site safer uber driver letting dog drive would safer uber driver
bee movie real
test india vietnam paved non paved street downtown rural passed test start believe
point technology start good condition develop expand reach time
possible still india hope know
need make profit shuttle cow around paddock
video complete propaganda
live nyc drive every single day people absolutely terrible driver personally cant wait every car autonomous
point convinced scrap every single car thats used transportation purpose buy million car traffic basically non existent
changing one kind car another reduce traffic wouldnt public transportation better approach
jan b robot respond better u every single car road fully automated would mean car wouldnt cause traffic first place unless malfunction
sorry one
unspoken problem comment arent acknowledging dismissing saying smartphones anyways safety autonomy corporate government control transportation agency part driver mean transportation cut society undesirable dissident every convenienceadvancement also come accrual power may deserved even end day think tech really cool would trust could full access set driving time place approval needed regulator dispatcher
thats tesla better wouldnt put past google wander direction insinuate
idontneedahandleyoutube think tesla cant remotely shut car
henlofren probably could automaker would hope elon would safest ceo trust power feel like people would understand shutting access vehicle wrong
idontneedahandleyoutube implying decision make court order shut car suspected domestic terrorist
henlofren would argue would least fight kinda think moved texas still cant offer promise think kind overreach unlikely point know future hold wager plenty people hang legacy auto learn fabricate part driving tesla point unless thing drastically change next year love little leaf cheer
grotesque propaganda check tom nicholas take case
oh yes flight wasnt whole tu low pilot along som ting wong rest
pas test
driving fun
thanks pal
one basic quick question happen middle road camera doesnt work lidar stopped scanning thanks
funny american literally spend billion dollar useless technology like solve like problem car cause instead hopping bus train bike
want car road
automated driving car never become standard human error standard plus share road pedestrian cant mix auto manual controlled vehicle hand key future flying vehicle work fully automated system
imagine cut speeding give driver piece mind surprise surprise there driver
really wish video wasnt sponsored waymo would actually make information optimism relevant
one question there accident speeding offence kind legal infringement legally liable
want better public transportation road
imagine autonomous vehicle far safer seeing road heavy rain snow hydroplaning ice
ssshhhhhhh
itd rather walk bike drive even bus lyft uber taxi carpool w stranger certainly friend drive friend who driving abilitysubstance use unknown w im w autonomous vehicle especially given theyll prevent traffic theyre dominate vehicle road
come bangladesh let see far handle
strange choice poll response cant wait dont think theyll ready year far mutually exclusive would answer
drive crazy many people often concerned unlikely edge case work software development hear lot often people account every possible scenario
see derek mueller promote technology put worker job bravo
one day probably mumbai reduce traffic
yeah let see drive snow line white road
world domination
world domination
doubt ill live long enough see live good thing
anytime drive busy freeway worry agressive driving driver inattention unexpected situation etc tech hold hope safer transportation course failure forget many killed today highway
every time topic come reminded even u lived large city navigated countless complex scenario without accident decade bother topic isnt technology perfected go much asserting kind ai tech determinism eventually force mass transportation system autonomous vehicle autonomous human driver one opportunity data collection wealthy fine howeverthey private vehicle billionaire revolutionary way likely private highway systemlike elons wet boring dream
oh trust self driving car alright dont trust non self driving car around ride manual driving legally banned except emergency
tell want driverless car pushing like everything else name safety lose individual right driving car personal skill right allows u exercise autonomy personal joy like going walk riding bicycle future want know drive rely rule everywhere go logged catalogued free society never accept stopping driving car oh yeah self driving car safe unless car driverless sound like big brother coming
aight straight know people probably shouldnt ever drive hell one person mind id never get car driver circumstance even think superb driver know fact everyone aint thats sooner better buuuuuut ngl ride motorcycle would super sad driverless nothing life time haha
single lane im kph car pushing behing reach twin lane section move right look left mirror he damn far away slowed slam brake let pas left back single lane he back distracted influence self driving car great honestly simply love driving around even older car
yea train instead
rael pubblic transport network
father get distacted manual transmission car
derek subconsciously always thought name veritasium
ultimate test kind autonomous car put drive jakarta traffic
along make india also push autonomous drive india elon musk lobby lowering duty
know im ready since blind one eye think reason simple im already used car without driver basically would used thats would get used anyway several blind people think would good idea basically would need mobility instructor train u use thing thats id like see happen think mobility instructor train u use selfdriving car blind disabled think would work fine basically could get around lot faster taking bus case live seattle area ill link light rail train get doctor appointment much quicker bus link light rail way would save time would save effort walking bus stop right since im older person besides blind think would make easier get around far people wheelchair dont know thats going work would need special van wouldnt worry basically would trained get around one selfdriving car waymo
great idea developed roadway thinking like criminal road skeptic several ifs system failure system hacking vehicle lead unintended destination travel offroad interferrence monitoring system etc believe computer better sensor detection system human could calculate better response truly future specially drone car become public transport computer system control traffic route manual driver danger road
test car amsterdam jakarta simple drive city like new york example
insinuates great extent driverless vehicle synonymous shared vehicle meaning private ownership would greatly diminished rendered obsolete advent technology everyone feel thought
well video advert taxi service veritasiums perspective problem car sharing supposed solve car spend time parked although work commute since everyone tends commute time probably better public transport anyways
janb yes understand apparently part veritasium proponent far le individual vehicle ownershipi asking feltwhat said reiterated car sitting still little hard see problem mean real issue see initial expenditure resource actual manufacture vehicle grand scale really would prove minimal differenceespecially marketplace forced manufacturer build utmost efficiency longevity mind doesnt take much material build car fact given potentially long lifespan wellmade vehicle could still worthwhile anecdote owned used chevy nova already well around mile got toyota engine ran like absolute dream gave away person need year lateri subsequently learned person sold gifted car saw someone else driving around point car made last long time replace gasket tire etcloland mind individual freedom movement reason enough offset sitting time calculus mean look corporate parking lot full several hundred car think shouldnt people driving car right insane mealthough understand people different world viewsim asking order hearand explore specific aspect factor may considered whether agreement
janb aside zero problem forum veritasium making infomercial whatever chooses believe freedom dont feel obligation disclose damned thing free access free speech volition cant state enough others often come fire didnt disclose didnt disclose thatto horrible mindset run counter freedom speech long someone blatantly deceiving others legally defined false advertising case buyerlistener beware
even dont technology keep two train colliding track supposed believe million car kind weather safely drive
mentioning software bug feel like commercial advertisement
think autonomous vehicle may work certain infrastructure controlled environment like elevator case public road designed differently around different concept
kind agree tesla selfdriving system work brilliantly case confused case example road line faded unclear point take many human driver time including newer software much closer waymo tested dramatically better least dont full autonomy system assist rather completely replace thing condition good enough let car drive whether road retrofitted machinereadable addition put emphasis painting good line incremental
tomharrisonjr take many people thinking side box regard usual car invented body thought work train track developed road system around early suburb built beginning car era garage back house small lane car get main street simply didnt think road front house used car new concept even developed fully autonomous vehicle capable dealing complex situation without worry risk factor costly level inhibit mass adoption hinder development simple solution wonder need complex software radar infrastructure
tesla company working solution based existing road system would nice change road ultimately far harder ai selfdriving solved long meaningful societal change could occur company like waymo rely premapping everything hd map work limited area eventually give idea unless goal make businessowned taxi big city lol
finally know female counterpart name beuler yes im aware last name
technology handle month snow live camera lidar sensor covered snow ice slush salt road line wont properly visible half year sign get covered snow traction acceleration braking different visibility poor time etc would take awful lot trust one canada time soon still cool tech ill tempted try one next visit phoenix
id love see autonomou car sooner rather later wouldnt reason car insurance go point also id feel lot safer riding motorcycle close call riding bike someone distracted phone simply checking blind spot
distracted autonom car ram motorcycle next truck couldnt recognize
joshtyrreece evidence speaks even remediation system issue resolved problem
completely irresponsible
everyone tends forget political hurtles hear politician saying take away freedom flock getting angry mean people keying tesla right anger
german student looking forward never getting driver license
one car transport one person people complain global warming
thanks technophile
worked development lidarsystems radar detail request tell dont want autonomous vehicle still way prone error good great yet people saying driving auto year wrong people saying never happen wrong condition like autobahn good weather easy manage beware night raining cat dog construction site come across
psstlet illusion
youre saying true take vehicle forcing driver drive manually weather condition inadequate drive automatically case due statistical benefit driving better human
think quickly ai outlearn human ultimately dark raining cat dogsand construction site come average person already super dangerous bot dont perfect better halfblind grandma probably license revoked decade ago already crash bot doesnt get distracted miss sign looking something else zone second id give computer degree constant vision analysis better odds spotting hazard extreme condition right machine learning advance exponentially though know much might progress next year also insane idea construction site road hazard could marked program car access near future
ndulcimerold road hazard always changing google map cant track accurately reason scenario car would need nearperfect accuracy also machine learning bit illusion true computer iterate problem lot faster human learn specific direction something outside car knowledge base appears eg vehicle doesnt get identified vehicle atypical animal business fallen powerline etc doesnt set response fall back protocol algorithm limited dataset tricked simply introducing something doesnt data human really good making create new thing naturally issue worked improved may eventually resolved see reason trust machine trained california arizona weather generally pretty mild relatively dry texas summer north eastern winter doesnt make sense also im pretty sure halfblind grandma isnt average driver nitpick important one point since selfdriving car supposed replace average driver
hi detail lidarsystems
dont like robot taking soul thing
say high level confidence self driving car solution safer future even car combustion engine could lot efficient emission could reduced accident life absolutely unnecessary also near miss could avoided driver paid attention also topic automated driving dont know common drive behind car sometimes kind black keep driving normally following car front come back everything fine im lot closer destination wish could purpose tho ever rich people afford self driving car im gon na drive manual diesel propably retire even
hope dont live near hand black often enough u wont around much longer worry
car must follow natural selection choose wrong one without helmet way nobody left helmet home scare car even think car must go hit guy without helmet he got sight educational purpose
self driving car thanks dont trust government car programmed take work nothing else
exactly imagine world government put regulator vehicle prevent going certain location force go location way acting recently countless mandate impossible believe future every car road automated controlled better low social credit score refuse th jab else lose driving privilege
totally agree sooner better
meehh want drive driven around fun chauffeur autonomous vehicle aaand never type accident year driving besides damaging side mirror first car switched new audi great great old mazda ba mercedes class grandiose mercedes e class triple size brand new vw van small yr old cute seat ibiza meaning great reliable absolutely normal car class idea driving fun e class survived ibiza still service also love autonomous vehicle would takd away fun driving come
im sure human better exceptional pattern recognition individual experience many people trucker mostly cabtaxi driver people drive lot literally predict many situation intention others motion car bad situation uncommon high speed maneuvering avoidance outofbalance control race driver specialty last part human living being goal got stuff emotion get better u become impatient angry frustrated prone error neutral person making way traffic
well put friend
human instinct computer plane crashed hudson river solved computer pilot used instinct reaction timing save everyone
jrsygrl yeah watched documentary true special circumstance im pretty sure ever flew plane crash land also plane landing done without issue daily basis driven autopilot computer computer getting advanced already one beat good ai chess even magnus carlsen
rahulxtremegaming dont jerk even million one still something whatever certainly nonexistent even blocked happening probability given sometimes illusion depending people stake like german military bragged unsinkable sub got sunk stuff like pragmatic crash landing always table
mean come derek doesnt give moment challenge self driving car weather reason riding phoenix seattle
someone come place drunk high generally careless people literally end killing folk every single day vehicle im selfdriving car long kill fewer people careless people driving right win
living snake pliskins la
im looking forward fully level autonomous car dont want make moral choice car choice killing pedestrian walked road v steering onto sidewalk kill dont want car choose kill thats st degree murder kill stupid people walked traffic without looking
cant wait till come chatham kent canada
always seem see type vehicle used nice condition fare foggy day night heavy rain would trouble heavy rain night major snow storm eg blizzard resulted poor visibility human
sold greedy little oink used got paid youre like lady night worse propogandizing something need use make seem legit honestits sad
please go back interesting educational content wish could see dislike ratio
sensor camera fail vehicle forced stop able manually override
oof maybe need plane car started thats put fake engine noise speaker pilot something extra remind throttle zero might able save themselvesand passenger
get line gas station though
derek longer awful traffic covid work home
blind person want driverless car way finally car able go want want come driverless car want
one best thing coming age time place learning drive car year old anxious exercise rite passage screw driverless car good luck one push
live country sized parking lot cant even get grocery without stuck traffic good luck
long prick elon go bankrupt dont care happens
go jail car kill someone also technology dependent well kept road road paid via tax tax paid people drive living driverless car never work plain simple
driverless car pointless cant sleep drink riding
never feel safe autonomous vehicle plus enjoy driving
another way rich people look poor people im
interesting population find who interested driverless car point obsessing united state bizarre form capitalism really got hold mind folk europe highspeed train everywhere car removed pedestrian area everyday come u crumbling infrastructure highspeed train people obsessing driverless car simply another con job farther monetize another aspect people life say squeeze money population becoming poorer poorer every day
confused world live would wasted effort try fix nothing wrote corresponds reality make impossible converse
nixl he kind right though sorry soybrain got triggered imagine said something abd elon man would pissed huh
there nothing fix good
amber sushi blinded fanatic probably missed comment amazing people feel threatened anything new anything undermine course try politicize consistent brake progress
luislopez course ud say lunatic understanding lunatic may good arent fact belief ok prof point thanks comment ignorant useless help lost cause
expect getting fairly decrepit sometime looking forward driverless car time life
first convince need kind car
dont good dont either dont need boat either still recognize others need car andor boat
five year ago knew autonomous car going reality yea closer think wonder itll change long hauling cargo transport
really dumb idea interest whatsoever thanks thanks
already safer driver u revolutionize transportation many way dumb idea exaclty
cant road selfdriving car programmed people certain thing certain situation come briefly video mentioning choice hitting motorcycle driver wearing helmet v motorcycle driver wearing helmet another situation car choose hitting baby road driving cliff avoid baby kill people inside car isnt discussed make choice car situation person writing computer code supervisor ceo car company switch car allows owner car decide car save passenger kill stranger mode sacrifice passenger order save stranger mode isnt switch option buy car car owner told way car react situation right decision kill driver v kill pedestrian choice made inthemoment individual something society dont think decide advance ready make decision advance get make ready cant driverless car road
arent giving car driver lidar camera human driver better situational awareness le u trusting machine people making machine trusting u dont care good technology ill like smith irobot getting motorcycle shipping container
wish would come tomorrow pessimistic id surprised came sweden large scale within year
would like see whats inside ecus running car precisely made
prediction many lawmaker hesitate selfdriving car flying car era b good public transport priority car anyway bet lawmaker eventually focus least many part world
real question though held accountable case accident unless manufacturerprovider take full responsibility would never take ride
problem see becomes service thats actually expensive owning car example buy k car last year thats k year spend dolalrs day going work dollar day get work get home thats dollar every year thats year tend forget corporation entity created make profit
think driverless car way like flu shot peopel alot safe driving going le people die car accident quicker get stop worrying crashing need find phoen answer opur bos calling better car drive instead drive take brain powwer drive let computational preciseness computer take tediaous task focus
noooo control u
one find driving fun
wait would eliminate parking lot
eliminate traffic light
yup
think everyone driving autonomous car would feel safe elevator
selfdriving car hit someone sued go jail
self driving car perfect adjunct community college teacher need shave eat prepare class commuting one school another
computer went haywire decided speed crash wall
hope never forced tracked google alphabet inc permission drive car
thats good point hope good privacy regulation around selfdriving car google someone else start gathering data riding car im
movie feel like ad would really saddened well give one privacy aspect life well loose freedom let google know even addicted tech giant well loose control even hard switch degoogled phone
sorry vehicle doesnt need driverless benefit radar add driveroverride critical situation like dont see approaching vehicle moving parking lot
poor taxi driver unemployed need traffic light
yeah theyll lose job like elevator driver old well need plenty new people develop maintain new vehicle computer though
whats point take bus
never understood argument social anxiety cant ride public transportation live mile nearest bus stop dont need car daily life either still recognize others
sponsor video
problem could solved people using leg instead ass le energy waste le polution le noise oh god beautifull site
im excited autonomous vehicle excited vehicle autonomous except hobbyist etc im excited u public transportation like high speed train would enable car go faster computer simply react predict much better human speed limit highway may something like mph instead mph isnt fast anyways country like poland standard divided highway speed mph course limitation drag still mph would mean getting place would much quicker
idiot want give government ability decide speed cant go often road
""
return riding horse
yes video im surprise u iam realy interesting video like show ur first video problem im afford new car lesdriver bcause im poor person simple like ur video think gd u cant afford ur imbicible car nice car txnst ur nice video like car never get video ok sir
nice native ad waymo
beautifel sooner better
wish min way daily commute could autonomous
bigger concern long completely away controlled car driver
wow autonomous car us turn signal
distracted driving using cell phone kill ton people regular basis
put see failure maybe human maybe year
car driverless always prone traffic bicycle infrastructure walkable neighborhood roundabout smarter traffic detection light bus line train line similar addition make road far safer require far le maintenance energy car oriented infrastructure would encourage people check channel bike especially video stroads get detail driverless car better safety record car delivering single person never dense bus bicycle im saying car arent necessary inefficient used transport one two people amount space take
insurance rate one day cost lot self drive
unpopular opinion human driven car obvious reason traffic jam human driving car lane road going absolutely cause traffic jam capitalist based ideology getting ahead expense others human driven car lane reduction situation perfect example capitalist system due self destruct individual human trying get ahead others expense race absolute last moment merging causing others slow let greedy jerk greed capitalism nutshell nowa computer controlled vehicle system say every car road computer controlled lane road go one every car could remain mph merge seamlessly socialist based ideology everyone working together computer doesnt care doctor lawyer getting ahead walmart employee computer considers human classless equal friggin beautiful traffic simulates economy society way one imagine
want cheap public transport
yes im ready want car driverless road
elevator automatic still operator u called driver country
driving road lahore pakistan road rage daily problem want get rid auto driving card solution
happens rain
nice green space car park used yeah right try even apartment block statement like former expose sponsor video
hastings good reason car connected internet
camera microphone would tech government fund tech surveillance platform
think ethical dilemma going cause trouble program stuff system youre never going make everyone happy would love autonomous car though dont like driving much
look like nightmare world never exist may work world pedestrian cyclist dont exist city much encouraging driving primarily u frankly look awful cross car centric road
highly doubt meant taken literally
future forced tech u car company able buy car drive pay privilage driving car form outrageous high insurance computer better claim fore higher risk facial recognition software mandatory gov mood scanned decide going use car day chinese commie style social credit score system
k
real secret driver drone pilot
th one caveat driverless car sometimespeople enjoy driving
software decide outcome accident hmmmmmm
yes youd rather fallible human dont think rationally situation like okay
safekeeper question
cibersecurity autonomous vehicle prepared respond already programmed scenario hacker know work wont vulnerable fake scenario like sudden appearing traffic sign supposed hacked would ai react
auto pilot like air plane wether one blow one crash dummy maybe crash dummy humanoid shaped
safe car road autonomous universal program make speak like one car broke near car itll notify car there broken car area cautious like giving car real time update
big floody puddle edge centre road marking narrow country lane mud road etc etc wont trust love tech people metnion aircraft pretty much automatic part changed matter course many hundres thousand hour use mean time failure considered camera computer lidar etc one part fails course screwed people dont maintain standard car properly lethal
technology limited tech limited ethic tech great tool aware intend use camera car privacy issue perhaps would want car used social credit system
eat bug live pod
""
corporate pr campaign frolicking edutainment stretching truth best
get bus god sake thing perfect ai algorithm crap make traffic pollution worse whilst denying job
dont need perfect need safer human already
primarily autonomous vehicle problem real driver something stupid glad never happens real life drive thank city snoflakes guinea pig
informational video little bit greenwashing definitely advertisement
want able travel without steering wheel public transit carsharing service exists want freedom captain shiponland car awesome place need realize cant put resource one mode selfdriving car solve bit problem car given city
awesome imagine getting taxi ride zero pointless chitchat bring
imagine next would fired ai work took job btw doesnt demand paycheck feel better scenario stupid chitchat cab driver last thing worry world
mvricku woe elevator driver yet look unemployment cant excuse preventing technological advancement imo
abhinabachowdhury absolutely agreed
lindsay dont work
c love chit chat
heck ill take one right
feel largescale solution car killing people walking pedestrian keep pedestrian road make far strict safety guideline pedestrian issue would hard expensive issue
yes blame victim
recently left austin tx job went ft remote high cost living traffic way people drive main motivation getting point people pulling front making slam brake almost every single time left house far im concerned driverless car cant get fast enough incredible statement coming considering much abhor dumbing everything day
leading problem people driverless car driverless car driving mph zone dont late
thanks maybe im old
know sure almost everything ive seen futuristic movie eventually human reality video think demolition man twenty year later self driving car next man sex mean sense
flashing light make car crash fix thanks human guy robot
cant afford short range luxury toy
million mile many year aquire meanwhile last saw tesla billion mile
green space area parking lot nope wanted green space would even parking lot
stop brainwashing society thinking crap like good
retoric behind autonomous transport safer better human even daily feel mastery like drive car even hard condition like snow ice narrow road think sad time car lover autonomity algorithm make lesslittle little insignificant soon fear illegal drive car good enough
age u air force showed u video camera mounted underneath fb fighterbomber aircraft tf terrain following technology plane traveling mph foot surface state montana glued seat id watch face cliff coming directly screen ridiculous speed looked like plane going crash view changed pointed toward sky side cliff ground beneath u told time system failed pilot tried take control perhaps dishonesty video maybe wasnt either way believed still believe close reality actual practice time year later watch debate autonomous car remember video laugh worry hear expressed know concern addressed respect im layman cant effectively address watching video im totally age find driving skill worsening work accommodate drive far le used one day access autonomous car need travel feel greatly relieved
cool story definitely would also like driverless car im already certain robot drive better wouldnt say im terrible driver
way stupid want autonomous take train bus
problem driverless car driver intelligence universe avoid accident fucktard driver decides something stupid road
police officer drunk yes officer driving im computer
industry standard software anywhere bug every line code look vehicle highly software controlled notice bug software frequently insane people trust life life others software programming drive vehicle
dont need perfect need better u
want car warns meter anything emits ticket kidding still
could use lidar accurately map place city model game environment watched video jjricks studio channel waymo car getting confused road cone stopping middle busy traffic waiting assistance taking stopping across two lane cone ok im convinced yet
thanks love driving
car replaced driver would police pull reason meet ticket quota
service cheaper normal taxi
anyone know stick camera derek holding cartcrosswalk incident
best thing big tech firm take car either entertaining thought outside parameter new normal ask question car easily taken able whisk away government education camp oh joy technology coming totalitarian technocracy
yeah hate happens elevator hit button fourth floor take ground floor posted something bad drumpf facebook driverless car inevitably like oh wait seriously fact genuenly seem think happen actually worry little
safekeeper fact dont given current world totalitarian measure far disturbing
im fan like elevator driverless car going happen inetibable
good perfect liable error
auto insurance industry ambulance chasing lawyer going need another source income
im pretty sure there supposed someone sat driver seat take something go wrong
doubt driverless experience supplemented actual person using screen control centre probably providing additional correction via joystick
fully autonomous car fantasy yes could exist purposebuilt road vehicle using system technology ever able subtle thing human driver comparing lift building silly lift go plane another stupid comparison plane fly air straight line never fully autonomous car unless within fullycontrolled environment
um watch video already
safekeeper see base control centre hundred screen obvious driving humanassisted thing fully autonomous car never unless every vehicle us system road sensor unrealistic dream made people sort said wed flying moon holiday
good coming home pub
took yet another contribution debate enthusiastic may elevated veritas truth somewhat look source hold keeping watch development technology
hello please check xfiles new series episode related se ultimate question software good enough control software since million death per year due car accident ban human driver world wide pretty easy using argument
work home stop driving around excuse get house safe aware dont slam brake something seems weird importantly pay attention unfortunately non stuff expect people
salam brother used satanic hand symbol left hand timestamp traitor
er
safekeeper uh yes
cute car idnotknow look ugly
ill never understand driverless vehicle even plausible first case pas safety test seems common sense onboard cpu hiccup crash danger everyone around vehicle unfortunately take multiple death realize bad idea drive car currently alters speed cruise control obstructionscars encountered scary enough sensor dirty radar system disables happens daily winter month even snowy day muck road spashes time feature set useless dangerous
dont need perfect need better u multiple death try million year human driver
crash human error error impossible machine makedude wtf talking driver make error due usually incorrect observation possible machine make make statement like youre talking sensor issue data isnt sensor data analysis data get better idea solved simply using machine massively flawed also noticed mounted camera film roof arm mounted obstruct lidar mentioned record good stop might gotten rear ended experience expertise accident talk still human driver waymo putting road end likely never billion simulation mile billion real mile ad without critical analysis downside transportation get cheaper say corporation profit monopoly transportation cant public venture private major continuation wasted energy personal vehicle dont even touch idea mass transit basically die video ultimately suck objective look ad waymo look person cant drive medical reason im autonomous vehicle let stop hype clouding reason deflecting ignoring legitimate concern isnt way forward look im autonomous vehicle im arrogant people like elon musk refuse use lidar safety measure kill people issue beta new software testing unqualified customer public road agree better focus profit safety capitalism always goal youve done year ive subscribed video ive watched liked sneak profit ad like educational content suck im unsubscribing channel
derek youre taking account plane car decision making driverpilot inevitably forced make point situation automation deal also failed discus fact zero visibility fog one many bad weather scenario autoland best coarse action also bad weather scenario autoland preferable wind shear high crosswind thunderstorm heavy rain contaminated runway snow ice standing water etc severe turbulence weather event autoland best way go fact allowed many phenomenon perhaps phoenix arizona road wide flat well maintained weather fine speed relatively low yes technology may viable country area speed higher road condition le favourable road le predictable think technology still way
like comment section actually idea even driverless car perfectly safe reliable solve traffic end yet another overly complicated version adding lane look japan eu hell even china place got mostly good urban planning good public transport system across country owning car mandatory like america time need car need run business rural area
brilliant final summary
hoammm kept repeating point youve already stated youre trying enforce something viewer mind got sponsored race though said millionfold experienced human driver
maybe cab artificially controlled racing car steamrolled human driver
entey name
ogrim team called arrival although admit falsely remembered steamrolled human driver could beat good weather condition

itll probably side stop remember react sound police siren different
never want driverless car inevitable reality selfdrivable car experience traveling would worse driver know best route take avoid congestion traffic make specific location quicker others self drivable gon na given reroute option everyone problem road follow

youre interested going point b great however people never driven miata
ahh yeah automotive technician never ever ride driverless car dont care many safety system made everything fails point think youre going take away driving privilege youve got another thing coming
come genius elon rich kid musk said gon na work care youll die sacrifice science
dont need perfect need better u cant believe hard understand
he saying people wont car forced take autonomous cab everywhere isnt ripe government control abuse would rather free vehicle go want go want go vehicle depend upon cab service take everywhere needed go thing automated done robot doesnt mean let train child responsible adult careful driver reduce accident way rather lose freedom
wouldnt surprised law enforcement ability disable vehicle remote

disintensify car usage make good public transport would cheaper effective autonomous car soviet learned back day
initiative auto manufacturer make standard communication autonomous vehicle one possible standard would communication vehicle movement would greatly improve collision avoidance since know others action moment
look older technology find answer yet enough research done yet see version better job choose
unfortunately selfdriving solved long intercar communication becomes reality ever legacy automaker move far slowly mostly part technology use acquired company literally dont softwarecomputer hardware expertise develop smart feature like first selfdriving car solve problem despite fact car road human operated cant rely waiting manufacturer suddenly come together implement thing time

never understood fantasy people seem entirely replacing car going bus line even remote cabin wood people cant ride public transport due anxiety etc trapped home say taxi taxi car love public transport much next guy youre getting rid car long time probably ever
safekeeper never said getting rid car entirely im saying autonomous car piss poor replacement public transit boonies cant take transit asinine reason whats wrong car already drive
ive seen lot testing done warm weather area perform winter weather environment road different changing instrument preform
make walkable city

wont car genius taxi service
rorychivers taxi cab spend time parked he presenting autonomous car substitute car spend time parked personal car taxi cab he proposing reduce waste people longer buy car spend time parked instead rely solely taxi cab totally different matter certainly stated matter basically independent whether taxi cab autonomous driven human cabby agument favor autonomous car he proposing reduce waste people use taxi service often still personal car personal car spend even time parked increasing waste parked car reducing way look statement still make sense agument favor autonomous car maybe genius see something missing
bradleybobbs ive got honest seems like pretty damn obvious exactly suggesting difficult understand line reasoning idea owning car spends existence absolutely nothing real insanity

need selfdriving car love driving people seriously lazy lol dont tell selfdriving car wont ever get accident going put lot people work truck driver taxi driver bus driver etc
button protective cover designed pulled like possibly worst design emergency system ever produced assumption always push design suggests perhaps sliding upwards nothing suggests pulling dont design emergency system stylish unique save power window
advert puff piece
people jerk road today never following speed law
guy climb stair would fit
realy like video always plesure watch hope driverless car take many year become reality like driving fear day might become difficult autonomous car become previlent
decides motorist prioritize hit hope chase one helmet till hit jk totally cool tech btw
would people start jwalking car like know car hit
million milesin small well defined sandbox
safe yet elevator danger hit elevator
note really old elevator didnt button floor round lever operator would control thing automatic
id rather drive car lift
elevator going fixed path
elevator go course easy automate
zaremol decide way go next pickup ease stop desired floor stop level floor ive seen old comedy movie elevator operator either high low floor
paulwetor thats nothing compared detecting traffic sign pedestrian vehicle construction zone etc
better video idea want car banned cite
aircraft analogy flawed misleading didnt mention number autopilot malfunction caused crash many required manual takeover avert disaster manual instrument landing possible common yes autopilot required zero visibility landing doesnt make particularly safe compared pilot better visibility
dont think technology much government policy
leave driving need hand corporation adopt autonomous car daily routine long supply demand priceincreasingmantra make ride impossibly expensive people claim service catering elderly disabled
waymo car pull emergency vehicle passenger wtf im late work override
people believe average driver thats well possible drive bad enough make five people good driving
ill stick old honda thanks
even ad video video ad
disappointed video yes said sponsored rest video look like well researched well reasoned video love much independent research video rhetorical obvious didnt much love channel continue love certainly skeptical stance viewing future shame never fully sponsored video channel like would suggest another video autonomous driving including company game rigorous research weve come know love unless course agreement waymo prevents thatif true serious black mark credibility channel shame
one cosmic ray changing cause multiple death fully autonomous vehicle never cheap future need lot protective layering
eager mention type accident human cause waymo simply better failed study type accident dont happen human wheel automated vehicle may struggle think shallow review
making self driving car avoid traffic accident feel like digging ditch putting ladder reach basement window much simpler idea stop make city car dependent look dutch
convincing argument im kidding youre going hit really hit home
ive saying year
biker concern autonomous vehicle theyll decide hit biker another target rather little focus ensuring recognize bike potential target aside car even suspect current tech improvement human driver frequently dont notice road user car truck look forward seeing autonomous vehicle put road sufficient training software consistently recognize potential road user
yeah tech definitely potential make life lot safer bike motorcycle share road car unfortunately human mindbody lot limitation really see clearly small cone looking car easy bikemotorcycle simply dont fit mind looking psychological thing like tend balance around certain level risk well take care around kid adult average people drive closer cyclist helmet one without one
could let technology mature enough first
want train bus bus driverless thats fine make driver job easier pretty much act like train conductor yeah train
already fatal road accident involving driverless car answer
dont want driverless car want carless driver car terrible mode mass transit replaced public transport
oh gladly would like make use vehicle
dont need driverless car need le car public transport
biggest obstacle u design neighborhood suburb development past year actively hostile bicycle pedestrian public transportation put huge parking lot public transportation stop people get neighborhood car
improve expand public transportation also train already autonomous car safer
alphacarinae well fun car dont deal parking traffic want fun traffic monopoly transportation well go head one telling ban car option car actually dangerous ineficient speed limit mile per hour highest speed freeway even today train run faster speed especially rush hour
alphacarinae tell option railroad pretty much crappy service point time bicycle true freedom lot danger caused car factor public transportation execpt anything related rail also great also let tell think pay freeway road private company person think invest mass transit even free mass transit efficient continue increase freeway lane car abd even plan one issue u basically need car every single member family instead two per family change understand think freedom car culture freedom freedom pay insurance every month freedom pay road limit go please remember car used place need infrastructure car like free go hawaii using car need transit car point great infrastructure thing need pay maintenance car however mass transit subside car please saying eliminate freeway need expand improve public transportation right improving quality road bridge
big brother chauffeuring
self driving car another way people take responsibility thier action embarrassment unless youre need
would feel one people pas car highway see there driver
liked video showing people reaction see dog driving
regardless never adress want dont need nanny state veritasium suggest decision would buy car germany driver always responsible action liability car regardless teslacompany screw
three incident involving autonomous vehicle long stationary car suddenly hit break front bike cant stop crash still car fault
think important thing automated vehicle never get stressed theyre never distracted something else life situation might accident someone driving wrong side road never initial thought omg ahhhhhh human sometimes never get past never act something way make stuff like head collision le damaging dangerous passenger long vehicle taught perform
seriously think maybe one best scientific chanels youtube amazing video
motorbike near want
good morning derek death crash america alone involving driverless car would like go today derek
david good morning derek death crash america alone involving driverless car people die every year crash u road early airplane death high flying incredibly safe seem simplistic idea
good morning derek drive brick wallplease keep seat belt fastened time
world driverless car actual vehicle manufactured much cheaper le durable today put effort money making car safe durable actually never crash even seat belt could economized planned obsolescence big thing otherwise car would last way long industry need break time nevertheless traffic world without accident super high safety wont much business used
decent public transportation infrastructure u wouldnt even need
dont want enjoy driving car
also hired promotional video nuke teaser advertising google
issue people treat like escooters ebikes city trash people put sticker camera two stop car dead become game teen driver le car bad area town shot paintball gun block camera stripped part wheel taken many issue people arent watching
derek friend assure take long time launch car indiaany indian know
ever referred elevator operator elevator driver ad sort cringe buddy
car like train drive track quite useless real world situation find interesting video waymo sponsored ad displayed vehicle crashing tesla waymo constantly injuring pedestrian sometimes fatally tesla autonomous driving isnt perfect light year ahead waymo
awesome hey waymo birthday july saying p
dont think autonomous vehicle solution use driverless public transport instead there better economy scale dont need waste money extra battery could also use overhead cable like vienna energy make environmentally friendly also mean space people outside straenbahn make city livable space road given people congregation drawing comparison elevator make sense distinct difference two
car get rear ended often country since stopping pedestrian somewhat considered optional car slam break pedestrian jump crossing round
anyone thought many ppl drive living going lose job driverless tech
bad snaxx anyone thought many ppl drive living going lose job driverless tech argument made since dawn industrial revolution
one question car come upon road work crew theyve shut one lane lane ahead made one lane there guy pole stopgo sign top he spinning alternating traffic car read tell get driver seat
dont want driverless car road
woo wee shill city
caveman comment
fine first passenger hurt killed autonomous car hacked even regular car hacked anything ip address disabling brake engine shutoff even remote acceleration possible think driverless vehicle much le likely hit pedestrian also seriously doubt whether autonomous car could judge car run red light accurately human could worst statement traffic death eliminated aka speculation contains logical fallacy begging premise good look scientist dont think technology mature enough trust life least time
im going stop driving
title truly american need public transportation everyone could even car swear american
truly developed society one everyone car one even rich use public transport
piccolo fact
nice come getting driver card
sheer folly back driveway hard see oncoming traffic driver dont back well late father taught much safer habit backing driveway
yes illegal back driveway angle packing reverse parking many pedestrian especially child killed car backing also failing give way people footpath sidewalk
tesla
bad idea must control vehicle giving much faith technology lead bad thing controlthe critical thinking essential come technology science man
increase average speed limit autonomous car might get people board there fraction difference safety benefit always go slower nobody going want end story anybody go mile speed limit left lane chime two week shut essential workerspeople who work actually provides needed value road everybody top people go slower cause accident people go faster
pedestrian accident literally people walking car
everyone watch channel okay mindlessly sacrificing freedom care safe efficient direct control machine
even minute there disclaimer acknowledge wont necessarily work well part world duh thats many u say tech ready see even heavy traffic believe driverless car navigate daily commute mostly driverless car use case computer nail time time whole point drive better human
car drive better yor wife
vast majority car accident caused people paying attention computer always pay attention computer tiny fraction crash truly unavoidable well result computer driver robot still obstacle technology taking cost implementation modding vehicle fact able drive road theyve got mapped database still give bicycle day
yes love tesla
driving function fun
cant wait driverless car become mainsteam day im going buy one drive around play cello back seat
feel like ad rather genuine veritasium video
driverless car pie sky idea suppose somebody infects software virus done easily perfect recipe tragedy
waymo sponsored video provided access technology personnel really clear basically minute ad
useless people looking figure spend time social medium
derek im still waiting see ride autonomous vehicle snow black ice traffic thats footage need see
driver drive wow youre bot
conclusion made make little sense cost traffic parking let alone initially describes technology today simply functional later tout current prowess
kerala elevator still run driver rush time
awesome main problem people people want control ultimately control look public transportation imagine bureaucracy political agenda made decision whether could go somewhere
probably made derek sign agreement mention tesla even
showed tesla smashing truck sitting stationary road clear view
research project year emphasis software architecture av got ta say really impressed complexity modular system evolved year year one interesting key found one experiment av perception time compared second human dream contribute work selfdriving company make av level automation sadly im australia
tesla
tesla white car smashed overturned truck middle road
mostly favor autonomous car road airline industry leaned hard way plane fly pilot doesnt compensate extra training partially lose skill need autonomous system quit working something unpredictable however selfdriving car driver receives nothing brief conversation salesperson isnt reliable source information owner manual insufficient im fan autonomous car way theyre currently forced upon u
dont want uberlyft driver go business truck driver follow suit besides didnt self driving uber car ran killed someone already got another yr perfect technology allow rush product possibly kill u wonder get yr one car autonomous truck malfunction cause accident end deadly one thats said take self driving vehicle shove kisser
driverless car scary human driver absolutely terrifying
government demand backdoor always actually already bidens administration infrastructure bill whenever feel like gladly take control car kill political dissident post something went viral government course blame technological failure case dismissed nothing see probably last resort government try really hard beat dissident submission way social credit score really vocal government amassed many follower social medium platform sorry digital credit used buy food board transport anymore thanks
remember reading google driverless car travelled one million mile accident none accident car fault whereas personally driven much million mile across multiple vehicle never accident accident fault car business road human driver feature make driverless car safer would feature installed normal car making driver safer robot get five nine technology dont benchmark human driver harvest metric compare word google want continue spying even quit using computer
upside convenience downside death relatively low chance happening choose
need garage car port apartment equal price per mile would jump aboard
thanks want holding wheel hell
mention waymo geofenced well done sir
driverless car start consumer vehicle way general public going except straight bat autonomous vehicle replace commercial vehicle first every wreck huge news year people get start make way commercial market side going put huge workforce work truck driver either construction equipment forklift etc cant stop progress though
bring waymo learn real traffic country maybe cpu get overheated minute
dont trust system dont trust road user behave perimeter car capable coping
seatbelt twisted annoys much
thats surveillinovation
maybe increase public transport instead putting even car road anything reducing human error done making improve learn mistake completely give control computer work towards autonomy human never gon na want thing life hence there room error cause youre never even gon na put situation make mention there single argument idea video make seem like huge ad instead thorough analysis itthis complex relatively useless solution simple problem lack transport people unable drive due physical mental issue age etcits called increase flow amount public transport budget waymo used car put public transport would solve lot way cheaper pure capitalism solving anything
mr ping say american small minded
yes need give control someone else like thats ever turned bad china pleased social cred score go low reroute detention facility
downside technology allow surpass human increase amount money needed build car increase price
also another problem would cop car need able chase car may say car automatic worry car chase well car could sold criminal arent selfdriving would current automatic car able chase would know stop stop stop cop car might stop chased car fake stop allowing get advantage cop needed use car cover shooting would computer know stop cant account possibility certain vehicle would need accounted however said support selfdriving car regular everyday car possibly car current time able set motion
video shame completely advertisement waymo critical example discussion accident around video say waymo vehicle stationary lead conclusion pedestrian vehicle one fault sometimes slamming brake like waymo video parking lot actually dangerous also call centre lady incredibly patronising call button pressed saying give one moment partner team okay future joke exactly google one support patronising helpful
video potential drawback driverless car
like everyone comment section year pilot experience
prefer drive car driving fun
show driverless car driving boston street night raining dont even test know possible today technology thats theyre testing sunny phoenix arizona every intersection left right straight pedestrian rare rain never happens
self driving car great cureall transport still need focus transit biking walkability self driving car solve traffic congestion self driving car one aspect livable city

bad lidar economical widespread adoption try tesla
derek possibly one cutest car ever seen car
want driverless car get drunk bar without pay nose cab uber
sorry autodrive autoland two different thing reason plane land safely many human environmental input coordinate moment atc gps il radar human pilot working moment assure safe landing btw human landing commercial plane fog since think youre making huge leap equate two thing
year
yall robust public transit
people nervous autonomous vehicle biggest single cause collision road wetware otherwise known steering nut dipstick serious reservation calling something accident collision occurs vehicle operator deliberately take control automatic system ca deliberate act
like idea driverless car there simply much outside outside normal driving regular vehicle one instance dont forsee ever going mud wood two thing lot rural area require get home say grocer
driverless car stupidest thing ever heard
driverless car perfect better average driver could reduce death road even would huge wait autonomous vehicle
dont develop safe cyclist road sidewalk get lot car road complete live netherlands almost never take car cycle everwhere better wallet better nature cyclepaths safe people start use dont know mayy promote yt channel bike give better solution putting car road
driverless car accident
big city much earlier many think much later others imagine case way go natural way driving evolution
driverless car great experienced driver already developed driving skill want hand task algorithmically superior process terrible younger generation people yet born already developed driving skill people never develop muscle memory instinct human driver need condition driverless car arent suited never see argument made anywhere debate driverless car one thing say human dont need actual skill abacus abacus slide rule electronic calculator away need human skill always need human skill condition driverless car absolutely suited advisable need human driver develop skill humdrum road muscle memory instinct
driverless car computer fail people killed wring hand dismay say seen coming computerbased device ever failed
first like driving second dont want run around looking public transport convenience car far superior anything else third would never buy purely autonomous vehicle option switch fourth would never buy electric car crap range take age charge compared minute fill gas new stuff crap
hell would never want
lived phoenix there enormous blind spot snowit doesnt occur phoenix except maybe year like every couple year ive also lived drove part western maryland drove mountain snow storm id love see add adverse road condition analysis vehicle response forefront mind positive driverless side biggest error people make skid hitting brake also knowing phoenix sandstorm haboob affect lidar

autonomous vehicle skilled human slippery condition
believe autonomous car make road safer dont think itll get rid traffic quite time long option drive manual exists people use people cant calculate rate keep track anywhere near amount factor autonomous system problem human driver need two five time much clearance get onto road need several time stopping distance avoid hitting car front extremely variable piece system sure leverage legal responsibility onto guy happened manual driving enabled accident occur going prevent people account variable ie manual car get stoplight autonomous car ballet stop theyve crossed eventually require software patch prevents changing car manual within ft intersection car already auto moving make spacious bubble around guy driving manual car length autonomous traffic lane possibly lane next thats lot lost space le thoroughput stretch road worse difficult predict factor literal bug bit dust debris lens crack etc computer camera misidentifies wind making poor decision based nonexistent factor there improper maintenance general failure component say guy ahead get tire split half torn tin happens facing torn side heck transmission take second longer catch next gear opposed speed usually ballet car maintaining momentum becomes pileup one dancer took second longer part result need slower ballet account car need come full stop crossing opposed saving anywhere second minute youre saving second mostly driver reaction time tldr serious improvement driver safety likely cure traffic decade two
polarisraven self driving car cut traffic massively way achieve theoretical ballet thats mentioned video even something like autonomous car road would make huge difference highway traffic
live area cold snow much third year id like know autonomous vehicle would handle driving blinding snowstorm human visibility foot would handle driving behind one snowplow clearing road way
car eventually kill someone responsible

distracted driving computer controlling car constantly evaluating multiple scenario although fully support system question comment distraction
said waymo way
opinion youre close quite correct crash occur often today think driving become routine easy think year old learn allowed anywhere there road car many feature take away actual driving skill power steering automatic breaking bell whistle tell everything etc growing learining drive took hand wheel even second youd end ditch nowdays take hand wheel second time often chastise brother us hand talking smoothness ride give unrealistic feel fast youre going efficiency brake mean people trust work well follow closely anyway thought older driver thing id like hear developer happens camera go cant see whatever reason robust component thing like lidar device doesnt get bug debris stop working like windy condition there leaf sand etc sworling air contacted government decide who responsible accident occur since actual driver owner company person car passenger great overview however would love take ride one hate driving
brake
sking correct fixed thanks
fact human even still allowed fully control multiton machine kill people every single day amazes could videogametype ai car driving u around perfected steering stopping could going like mph everywhere stop sign light get everywhere much faster much le stress would never accident would constantly connected running simultaneously even car going top speed driving extremely limited illegal future cant wait people still alive didnt let johnny get car drunk try get home
delusional
trust car without driver idiot driver road driver adequate
u autorelated death per year figure move death decline attributable increased use autonomous vehicle become dominant
hey derek hongcouver familiar toronto bring autonomous car city see long last burbs like surrey scarborough brampton matter drive dvp nothing queen e double dog dare never mind sedate clear street south happens street covered snow huge berm curb plough gone paint biased limited story

google map went wrong drive siberia camp
ill tell go ride one bad boy somewhere road arent super wide like usa try thin poorly signed surfaced road side mountain alive clean underpants end ready
question occurs police car whatever reason want pull driverless vehicle car recognize occurring happens fault comply
talk car pulling road hears siren guess thats one way
onlyme assume however dont think problem would commonplace afaik u siren carefully tuned recognisable automated system intersection signaling system use stop traffic intersecting direction prioritise movement direction oncoming emergency vehicle long story short system place long time work well see reason mistrust case
pretty impressive need anamolies though like construction cone cutting lane merges older city try milwaukee rob maurers route tesla model thats pretty good challenge progress look good
cant lear people dont need car go toilet
addicted channel autonomous elevator make strong point initial fear technology largely unfounded travel single controlled path mechanical governor assure catastrophic failure aka falling impossible sure applicable situation far autopiloted plane environment fraction traffic weighing pilot receive much training require much higher certification driver still average mid air collision per year non end well def one guy worry situation valid concern
future certainly driverless car waymo
car drive empty highway minute say theyre ready ive changed many vehicular sensor avoided many random incident consider driverless car ready compare plane landing flat marked observed runway leaving empty airspace stupid likening elevator even stupid pointless commercial
pretty clever way get view change title old video youtube suggests channel subscriber watched already click watch realise happened

bottom driver responsible accident full self driving car better bottom prevent least accident problem largely one liability human terrible driver lot accident way punishing make u feel better computer accident cant get revenge computer perfect people accept
greatest threat automated driving hacking used kill vip enemy country may even used cause massive number death changing code human essential basic control system emergency situation must automated
issue self driving car anyone one short time completely dependent something bad happen like system short fail hacked dont know could major catastrophe would really terrifying dead could million people worldwide second furthermore car ridiculously expensive road sometimes great either especially countryside addditionally order system work need car perfect working condition ever mean car expensive thus repair car expensive well might prove issue highto mid highmid mid class people car ever come day self driving car widely spread could prove huge biggest issue furthermore issue made pressing time need car age short issue al driving something need technology perfect condition may possible air plane public transport case average citizen prof rather unlikely
human error cause accident hmm sure since car driven human like saying lottery winner bought lottery ticket come back statistic there actually large amount selfdriving car road
one side bad driver would appreciate machine would drive instead hand software developer im quite scared ai error day software car road bit complex problem elevator nobody path movement anyway elevator often behave weird people understand precisely guess would way messier driveless car
everyone worried driverless car become mandatory transport become government analyzed controlled tiniest detail sorry cant speed slightly unreasonably low speed limit even though road empty wife giving birth car sorry road closed due opinion expressed social medium
totally disagree one worst offender airplane comparison sky variable weather system designed around perfected said road obvious reason
joyless existencewhy hire someone else live life well
didnt tesla decide get rid radar sure believe build something safe going protect drive important people normal people able afford ride like tech cost
want computer fly rough condition like dense fog also dont want computer navigating pothole poor roadway thats hell leap made
imagine one day vehicle autonomous traditional driving banned car communicate sync stupid accident
crux dereks argument basically ton mistake human driver could make automated car could never make never stop even consider reverse claim mistake automated car could make human could almost never make incident reported one excuse driver going speed limit really uncommon occurrence would potentially example mistake human driver would le likely make human dont expect everyone following speed limit
yeah human driver stupid thats driving speed limit common le human drive well see le stupidity
concern hackable probably much experienced hacker

hello frank baba
good comment couldnt agree part video dismisses serious issue saying dont worry highly unlikely complete dealbreaker simply cant say taken seriously problem must addressed attitude well never work
driving provide million job world replace robot well
ddoumeche industry working replacing automation b people job depend needlessly killing ten thousand per year argument isnt going get traction job necessary resource live reason job feel necessary society tied resource needed live good enough job nearly every job replaced automation increasingly society going move past fixation job soon whether like driving particular need automated american job would replace american death year would stop thats ignoring fact find another job many driving job already even without automation terrible job find another job people kill cant find another life
merennulli actually good point saving job isnt good argument come cost people life plus said economy move different system soon something like start trek tng
here thing every human learn drive scratch share experience driver meaningful way hand self driving car share experience self driving car collectively acquire amount experience one day human acquire lifetime self driving car road every single day acquire lifetime experience human every two minute likely already passed point selfdriving car better driver human
one never ever want auto fully replace human element mercy system could potentially locked administrator ripe abuse think never happen trusting technology dependant needing exist hope dont cripple even reckless adaption technology
im interested police stop
concern autonomos car attacked hacker
want eat bug well
fun run child crosswalk

man american really dont know handle thing autonomous car virtually useless far used certain area often rather small b need monitored human c dont help clearing traffic road also function outside human driver sphere interaction regular human driver might problematic would improve number fatality achieved public transport also brings benefit believe u definitely could solid public transport system though compared country good germany even excellent japan public transport u many time death per caput country u time many death germany nearly time many japan neither country autonomous car yet ask put money public transport instead people large city would certainly prefer drive heavy traffic looking parking spot worrying car damagedstolen parked slew problem attached driving parking large city lot idea rest world might built bus line innercity transport passenger train transport city already railroad u theyre used transport passenger bizarre reason beg good sir research next video
im convinced selfdriving car would handle driving snow covered road road black ice blizzard least current technology area receive snow perhaps
autonomous car pussy alpha chad

diverless car scare crap safety reason many people way enthousiatic yes might cool future technology finally save u feel like similar situation s car viewed exactly future technology finally save u known long time cardependence many place created lot problem dont worry future technology called driverless car save u maybe dont learn mistake create even cardependence make city even worse meanwhile glad live place forced drive car dont know make fun people think forcing everyone drive called freeedoom really really sad
indoctrinated stooge
everybody car except love riding winter dont think would handle snowy road good
nope thanks like driving thats enough want driverless car
saying one hour autonomous driving one hour human driving term knowledge acquired inaccurate textbook example human understand previously unknown animal look like single photo typical machine learning network would require thousand picture animal achieve human performance said yes machine learn task extremely quickly given adequate data argument could better formulated
downside anyone try predict one maybe increase number vehicle street
ever gps give wrong direction imagine car automatically following gps one wheel stop
dont pit public transport self driving car great
one universal fact computer crash
people advocate driverless car unamerican soul starved ghoul
im sure didnt watch irobot
video honestly difficult level meaning easily understandable majority foot locker customer know mean multiple depth dimension dont dont time investigate educational explanation video dumbness american everyday mall shopper alot worse basic science understanding example people dont know oxymoron mean harshly doesnt impact ability purchase whatever stupid airpoor rich
saying video sponsorship ethically fine derek need income live consider one video earned derek google adsense know much waymo paid yt content creator million subscriber like derek producing video month bringing per year one video per week double yes overhead consider equipment help travel etc derek danger going broke doesnt accept corporate sponsorship video like damage creator credibility may lose subscriber
ive got many trust issue
imagine make cbds autonomous car relax road tense driving
im waiting robot highway chase scene smith real life
ive driven traffic seen automated car action hard read typically people drive normal car exhibit form body language read experience driver tell someone want merge lane turn indicator used automated car isnt case ive seen speed slow seemingly reason pump break use highbeams signal reason known programming
really smart ai deliberately show u useless ai would explain distrust know ai hard time navigating phone call
computer powerful human
thank world peace planet peace shalom salam namaste
there limit much automation human really need surveilance
using red arrow thumbnail like damn clickbait loser unsubscribing
like driving look boring
unsubscribed ashamed getting danger vehicle hacked en masse ai never safer human consider worst case scenario
totally disappointed im calling shill difference human ai driver human never hacked en masse fancy french word totality ai car truck hacked en masse gon na starvation level event longer able transport food weaponizing civilian fleet vehicle point apocalyptic
uhm motion mean least something width length one point time place later else spacial dimension plus time wich mean actually dimension others learn dont get wrong like video lot
im behind wheel
good condition yep encounter something unusual youre probably going crash rather stop go around personally im sceptical hell choose killing ten kid killing itll choose kill thats want car thank much im altruistic
driverless car much bump cross street break window spot
everyone gon na clap right
need driver licence anymore helpbots takeover going replaced vaccine passport
eyo aint need tesla lookin thing got ta take train f train get union station macsoogal street everything five boroghs right got bus taxi skyrail man future got wedway people mover every freakin building upper manhatten joisey even staten island new york city funk need goofy as thing people best driver ever told tumblr ill tell self driving car ever need one drive butt door couch long hard day grab clicker put game big apple nyc go dodger go sneps aint never gon na convince anyone else goin real car junk keep trying keep u safe danger invented aint need backup camera window possible see aint need airbags thing doesnt go million mile hour got dang reason aint need electric gasoline made outta pee
find amusing
way monitor u put folk work
mixed feeling great non violent utopia mob trying get could stand front car break window driver could help get safety
trusting vehicle trusting engineer programmer planner tester
love veritasium video however talking autonomous vehicle without talking tesla like talking law gravity without mentioning newton understand channel need income sponsored video still would hope science channel neutral objectiv tesla undoubtedly leader field dojo simply advanced technology today fact needing lidar make system much flexible need premapping type comparison would expect veritasium one image tesla accident suppose follow script provided sponsor shame hopefully video like
nobody interested driverless road killer work harder
thanks like control computer hacked glitch etc responsible person safer machine horrible driver yes worse machine
want train
think nice safe world would idiot making mistake
happens bird poop camera
come camera clean long time
heading west evening wet road reflecting direct sunlight certain confound driverless car hard see anything much le cyclist shadow roadside vid nothing allay fear kind contrast problem multitude adverse visual condition frame video driver think average conveniently evades issue legal driver better driverless car adverse visual condition limited neighborhood
itd able see cyclist regardless lidar got ton sensor camera process much data human ever could
thenerdbird happens sensor fail electronics dont infinite life
octoslut quite sure enough sensor fail itll still manage get safety notify owner phosiply eaven lock fixed hell drive fixed
cant wait autonomous driving seemed like research slowed happy hear waymo still track tesla seems moving forward
look forward becoming standard moment car heavy safety measurement could imagine perfect safe driverless system car could much lighter thinner wheel electric battery would give much better range battery moment heavy though
everything changing fast pandemic dialled people get paranoid feel threatened lash easy target like driverless car instead massive existential threat like virus climate change want drive death machine butmore global institution deal global threat well thats wrong
squamish realize many see carmotorcycle symbol status macho life style people town like speed narrow street child play would see future brings say
jeanpierredevent im heavily side driverless car whenever timing space pretty much exactly one year teenager early people hometown people killed car crash slaughter idea dangerous driving burned head young age
uhh whats going driving age limit
yaa jobfor driver vehicle
parking lot parking lot front business full one nearby across street know go wait kept seeing drop curb mention away parking lot uh people local grocery store shopping car still need waiting bit end boilerplate sound good
work first world country big city road mall someone living poor corrupted country like never experience kind stuff
sidousri youre feeling sorry live usa mile los angeles legally blind live small rural community cant see drive yet ill never able afford one either wanted bad enough id move somewhere reality like whats sad people crossing border illegally treated better born
dont use seatbelt make complacent likely drive carelessly point beingyou look statistic whether distracted driver semiautonomous vehicle le safe car driven human point youtube video draw conclusion
agree human monkey home vacuum cleaning robot lidar top scan house perfectly let autonomous car pod come cant wait
well road rage movie anymore suppose turn good
dont want driveless car road dont want car road
want flying car
sidousri
virsho want teleportation
sidousri would cool ngl
scare year going look back say remember manually eat food want knowingly play video game always win challenge would want live like invent teleporters horizontal escalator restaurant sell total nutrition paste consumption autonomous driving crap bird train bus libertarian gon na killing lot automaton future quote eventually subdued machine grant u limited freedom let u live dream land got ta first veritasium video hit dislike button creep end
selfdriving elevator crap bird whats wrong taking stair libertarian destroying lot automatic elevator future mark word
safekeeper dont get said train bus analogous elevator trip predetermined path fine dont think understand automaton emotion fashioned strawman look like moving goal post good try
driver taken road drive slow fast fearful switching lane cause traffic jam behind cut nearly hitting wont happen car autonomous
unfortunately there car road bikers want use although yes id rather go biking car predictable use signal dont drive front making left turn getting onto road inch spare
ctgd totally agree even id like drive car id like deal human driver bike
awesome publicshared autonomous fleet varied sized vehicle take people everywhere tiny single seaters bus train according demand chose size route automatically think majority commute zero need drive car people passionate driving sport car weekend
cant wait autonomous car pick hang glider anywhere land
another great thing selfdriving car call wherever provided there road yt many incredibly pedantic people add
happens could ai assumes control fully autonomous vehicle youre locked destination beyond control might delivered behind gated wall barbed wire top tip driver last moving experience sayin
youre one poeple think covid vaccine give g arent
would stick autonomous vacuum
whats funny paint white line road cause car pile would awesome population control
bad weather
lose freedom anything name safety
thought cute guy talking autonomous car hitting stationary object see tesla later verified autopilot crashing overturned truck sitting stationary middle highway
veritasium one favorite youtube channel become little google infomercial im moving bad wonder much paid
dont let door hit way
safekeeper original thought thing see forgive seeing point given apparent limitation
sound like communism nothing happy everything shared private property live commune look barrel gun youll see feeling subject
please define communism word first definition totally wrong
sponsored lie
someone watched video see p
oh long ago wanted get youtube stop recommending video constantly also ive seen new

id rather travel car parked time travel car people vomit hookworm egg pet tick flick option want vomit bad bo hookworm egg dog hair
waste time testing u drive city india wont problem convincing skeptic
car self driven would accident would traffic jam people like moan thing let forget since mostly car sit around absolutely nothing autonomous car could use one need one would mean order magnitude le car road would help co level quite significantly right
yeah massive improvement
wrong whether car road time car road time still car road unless people forced travel le car significant difference tailpipe emission selfdriving car answer vehicular congestion large city bus train best solution
need strike threatened professional driver kickstart thing doubt safer totally automated environment human driven car road rage lane hogging rudeness error kill life road safe people riding elevator like resistance big oil battery powered car car industry must already resisting planning oppose world one longer walk dealership buy car huge loss huge saving life world even driving essentially battle u want drive around even though wed rather yes thats irrational human exactly commuter related anxiety want work ride waiting step get time matter bad traffic clear downside see construction industry quickly use eliminate garage sf home put workshop playroom big toy reality mean lucky transition world lifetime dont like change matter much better live would
boy drank whole pitcher koolade bought entire refreshment stand
good boy sking opposed comment sound argument convinced everyone reading drank cool aid sane logical one
includes paid promotion like paid promotion
ban car bicycle train future need know
lol
good luck
cant ride bike government force stay home watch daytime television
sking yep law enforced gunpoint force stay home people get shot
government decides problem would better accident like kind thing without historical precedent
send car cliff wanted get grocery cant open door safety cant call anybody help car blocked cell signal within realm possibility right
""
realmtbaddict within realm possibility right never mind live messed time shouldnt even surprised someone would say thing like
safekeeper wow somebody life tiny little bubble government killed mlk jr malcom x
safekeeper live messed time indeed video pushing communism disguised self driving car fun thinking world great place
like technology long enforced everyone
course itll enforced everyone selfdriving car like selfdriving elevator today car road driven human tonne accident like today want manual car phased
safekeeper manual car wife car automatic transmission
safekeeper would happy someone invented self driving bike enforced everyone
sking love manual
damn paid versatium good money
trust anxiety thats quite yet
definitely need traffic getting bad counting human operate vehicle scary
public transport
yulin agreed ideally automated
yulin everybody work office people tool carry go job job throughout day
realmtbaddict use public transport therefore public transport solution traffic selfdriving car make public transport selfdriving ppl want
yulin look like public transport really genuenly dont get idea people seem ban car everyone drive bus bike everywhere like literally cant fathom kind privilegued bubble live imagine say someone doesnt even driver license use public transport get everywhere
like chat taxi driver
im unconvinced bung one bad boy narrow unpainted poorlysigned english road nutter driving shop see safe really
title want watch minute ad driverless car
lol clearly state video sponsered people act big secret revelation youve made privy something
bike lane covered solar panel
honestly game changer car centric america country actually manage public transportation wont really see huge difference
one lived u large asian city excellent public transportation im say car still far preferable public transport
problem away job million driver around world big impact economy also driver start get different job affect people employee available required company start hire people cheaper result poor people around world another hit economy autonomous making rich people rich poor people poor
number would lower public transportation option widely available
dont believe drove million mile like mile day day
ive learning drive cant wait self driving vehicle
already place city even autonomous car allowed noone behind wheel interfere case something go wrong
""
car crash within minute city brazil would miracle
car autonomous every car would know every car able avoid crash car much easier pedestrian car better view tell car there person
kinda like borg startrek
dont hit anybody going hit someone stop hit protected something
choose one
youdontsayjpg way miss point
really need take money waymo video couldnt video different sponsor give honest unpaid opinion
kitt karr enters chat
imagine cop pulling driverless vehicle
safe people dying early year signifcant amount le time hit sustain human timer set somewhere year though reading predicament posted lot scientist past year already reached twice amount ecological sustainable humanity
cant even begin wrap head around kind thinking yeah sorry get sucked lose dad end wheelchair road accident need preventable death dont become many human planet jesus wouldnt better idea strive better family planning vaccination people wont many kid etc
safekeeper guy forcing leftest communist ideal right back throat people want everyone accept mandated selfdriving car people want beef consumption outlawed antibeef people claim cattle ghg emission destroying planet study show one fewer child reduces future ghg emission far measure human take pursuant goal efficacious way cutting ghg emission fewer people much stretch someone figure population control measure indeed good thing one government already tried
safekeeper thats interpretate said didnt say said thinking know catastrophe run hit magic b year save crash nothing small dent calculation yet humankind isnt even changing bit course like many thing way late everyone realizes safer road accident prevention far pressing issue addressed part video yes shouldnt scrubbed unter rack
rummaging bag applying makeup even sleeping mean describing current driver behavior
get ticket speeding
elon
wonder autonomous car like calculator way people basic arithmetic number sense skill weakened due dependency people become incapable driving even matter
suppose thats like worrying human unable operate elevator theyre selfdriving wont matter
choice dy
who live matter eye ai
lolol wlm
think job important go strike go prove job useless elevator driver strike
real question single bit flip proof
agree many point make still feel like advertisement rather usual video
wont work indian road comparison flying aircraft bit unfair seen sheer number control commercial aircraft sometimes wonder operated manually pilot moreover takeoff flying landing condition highly regulated one could argue automation better possibly somewhat easier option aircraft compared car comparison car much much simpler control operational environment much complex unpredictable finally people like matt watson carwow channel prefer launch car fun may like experience
wan na point driving car driver license analogist flying plane pilot license think need training experience operate successfully heck youll likely need training experience thing life since youve likely never personal experience training flying plane driving car obviously gon na seem simpler control didnt know control behind wheel read dmv handbook took driving test
itslife beg differ far analogy two activity concerned stop right fact need training successfully perform either order magnitude complexity intensiveness training comparable right never trained flying follow lot flying channel run actual pilot eg captainjoe mentorpilot dutchpilotgirl etc cursory idea complexity task flying check video one channel im quite sure youll agree interface commercial airliner mind bogglingly complex compared car imo simple pre flight check incredibly complex exhausting

technology policy make healthier safer environment citizen make sense since wish global depopulation
id like see handle road developing country
send one see well work canadian snowstorm
electric autonomous vehicle future say people stand make lot money happen
see electric towny im seeing autonomous vehicle
performance ev im keen drive
ikr
work country backroads might consider road like metro road country
wont long people wonder got human driving car
love drivingi still drive manual transmission
want see perform historical town super narrow road win competition roundabout
see suddenly car stop close pedestrian imagine road user eg skateboarder run standing still
still think work need done able drive road maintained would probably big challenge honestly dont see year away think within year good number self driving car available also hope different company making self driving car tesla waymo whoever else share algorithm system one brand self driving car isnt safer another drive vastly differently also self driving car able communicate would also really help even across multiple brand model still able communicate im excited hope waymo car come area soon
biggest problem number job lost
feel like regular car banned allow fully driverless car
car drive better wife exchange
human level billionaire millionaire poor human helping human accident problem kind earth peaceful thing help planet survive long
youre truly sellout integrity
automated driving far safer human driver automation make mistake human would never make like boeing max see therein lie problem even statistic show autonomous driving safer mistake ai make ridiculous human point view make u disbelieve statistic distrust autonomous driving
best start road cuz many driver rude could way communicate deal talking probs u order thats fighting confusion anything
hope office doesnt go
self driving car gunna everywhere give time
people think average driver would submit people understand fraction
dont even entertain future depends
aircraft mechanic started working selflanding aircraft lockheed l almost year ago major problem autonomous car bringing cost component
like say eg exactly tesla
thisismyname teslaa component equivalent aircraft part qualitywise getting
imagine cost repairing personal driverless car bad enough sensor coded part long time people accept personal use
wheres camera invisible
thought derek pointing banger left lol thought woah interesting future pull yup figure
stop globalists freak idea
see autonomous vehicle every day journey done year treading mile clock say done million mile would trust
isnt matter believing human good driver matter knowing technology cant reason yet using reasoning human drive therefore assume computer cant reason cant drive safely people road scare go college several traffic law expected people break dont know ahead time get crash quickly dont know driverless car would handle lot situation
cant understand half talk video im stupid one really good
u want drive thing
think people would worried ab security aspect hacking im sure encrypted well etc know always error correctly determining siren real fake im sure answer would say people need convinced making sure car safe outside control said driver think good driver also refer wanting feel control situation trust bus driver know trained also know ai trained hella
happens bird poop land camera piece trash plastic bag cover one
stop middle road get rearended bus
cool see job workplace vehicle truly amazing incredibly safe cant wait see progress coming year
car excellent covid era
year old disabled person autism spectrum pddnos would love ride fully autonomous vehicle able go place live united state america live south central franklin county waynesboro pennsylvania live east coast
shame thanks tom nicholas
thinking happens processer start locking update oh wait thats apple slowing phone trying get buy new iphone dont need
really looking rational way transporting people develop public transportation system hey public transportation sponsor video sadly
video literally question doubt ive topic answered degree im almost convinced last question would would efects autonomous car environment
whether vehicle autonomous environmental impact entirely independent thats like asking black driver impact environment differently white driver
induced demand driving energy consumption environmental destruction
people dont trust even comment section human human really feel see amount accident rate well maybe autonomous car really gon na standard year
hayabusawill able find one self driving model neal remember guy bicyclewho run self driving car phoenix wich u bone idle drive car sodont fly car fog
human wayy faster thinker obviously theyre distracted influence
ehm computer faster human many decade human reaction time second unexpected event computer react millisecond sure made think otherwise
true also distracted biggest thing computer advantage
safekeeper yes superhuman speed tesla video ignored stationary overturn truck smashed
nice waymo advertisement
yeah watched tom nicholas video
twin tower plane remotely controlled firing demolition charge
inb first person us fake police light cell phone pull autonomous vehicle
thats cool think phone computer often little bug
think fellow human often little big bug selfdriving car dont need perfect safer humandriven car already
safekeeper anyone need watch one many video available yt realize selfdriving car capable average human driver
congrats drive limited area long look ugly
getting around pakistan nightmare car
""
try put car traffic sao paulo rom istanbul el cairo cant see technology ready short time maybe year enough
dont know
ok development becomes must highway
never must balloon
balloon punk triangle
driverless vehicle existed look train tram
show work white snow storm condition
waymo tesla team
oh yeah create somthing like metro wrost evry level like la vega loop huge huge sarcasm
politician really worried saving human life focus getting type vehicle going instead trying take away nd amendment right number life saved life changed would order magnitude higher wouldnt interfering right driving constitutional right im sure uberlike infrastructure could work rural area would great urban suburban area derek press button talk someone get additional drive time wonder would work youre headed home sudden urge go hit drivethru wanted change one business another one busier youre call someone would late would kind voice command make close enough realtime
rather wasting billion driverless car arent read yet stupid idea like la loop politician could actually get city designed properly like rest world invest public transport
like tesla first problem price going affordable average person whats point
havent learned anything else last two year least learn government corporation collude horrible thing technology used limit mobility pry life control reject theyll force get insurance rate astronomical dont use theyll insure dont dont let even get foot door reject technology intention good
love truly cool tho hopefully blanket removal choice wont arrive soon meaningful life involves choosing adventure every choice invite risk get prepared asked forced forfeit number thing currently bring joy look around weve already experienced year like reduced chilling order best persuaded youll learn youre selfish lesserthan human cow people want drive dont care anyone else extratime alone one definition living picturing long life youre imagining free intact
considering enornmous difference safety manual selfdriving car im convinced theyll become mandatory eventually least phased new car selfdriving even though existing one still street legal
theyre working autonomous car im waiting autonomous quadcopters
dare test india
yeah find driver elevator country youre right wonder
self driving car exists every totalitarian hellhole rub hand
""
appears like good thing always open investigation claim far look promising question mind vehicle go million mile
visit coyt tower san francisco elevator guy
veritasium like discussing glaring inadequacy public transport nah turning raging shill waymo tom make hour long video debunking hell yea
video see public transport got topic apple orange
safekeeper erm bout title lol
car arent future collective transportation
never understood argument cant ever remove car road even wanted course dont might well make safe possible also selfdriving technology used train bus etc
right road india mess driver there almost zero filtration regarding obtain driving licence basically long afford bribe isnt really much get going expected people idea traffic rule convention horrendously stressful road say least sound obvious environment ready autonomous car flipside quicker happens better huge population like proper driver testing resource consuming therere simply hole system almost unfeasible sooner percentage car automated better none possible without policy change
caution critically balanced editorial advertorial
yes watched video
say one car pas human driving test allowed road mean trust teenager drove well one hour drive alone road car
late party motorcyclist await day thing common place follow rule full stop make autonomous vehicle predictable human error part mean im infinitely safer
thats great point driverless car wont safer driver also everyone else road
would multiple lidar system interfere
honestly would trust one could work offline basically want unhackable global connection shutdown hacking could generate litteral billion death car actualy really good hope work
good thing youtube removed dislike button safely ignore controversy
flight crashed automated system misrepresented happened
looked found guardian article confirming caused human error
knew positive opinion driverless car video sponsored driverless car company
would let spell check drive car wouldnt
apple orange
dont know enjoy driving car feel good control vehicle look weird want make sudden stop pick friend whatever auto mode useful let drive freakin car whenever want
thats good point hope therell way give quick command like pull take next exit
look like warehouse remote car driver hiding cubicle waymo maybe another theranos nikola many year development virtually progress
main concern cost much extra per car full automation cost
video sponsored subject please damage believability reputation lot bad info spat u right waymos marketing department disappointed record disliked
waymo sponsored video waymo sponsored video advertisement disguised information
er clearly state video youre making sound like he trying trick
need work winter icy condition good place test car area see different season
people become worse distraction mental thinking one road along thought process first faster get wherever theyre going people extremely going way speed limit turn cause lot accident funny people seem think car drive know driver thinking people self driving car know mean
amazing episode didnt want end however one bulgarian saying go internet best technology world people wouldnt survive without computer said well without wouldnt exist either important technology humanity world electricity guy serious u know happening caused solar eruption radiation interrupted telegraph line back close past happens autonomous technology strike one said wouldnt question dad also said even lecture university captured laptop every student laughing pioneer back good tech gadget record info think phone book record phone cloud didnt exist back phone dy youre using memory thing remember physically written data paper stone whatever may bound time exhaust electrical failure much reoccurring giving fact electricity discovered put use pretty recently history egyptian writing thousand year old delighted able read day read wrote phone ten year get new phone last one broke true cloud existed back even lost information old phone break lost whatever could technology much better sun eruption flare reach u kill datacenters well kill humanity moment riding autonomous car think otherwise much looking forward car drive focusing important stuff back seat
sound like control giving convenience
mean avoid million death injury traffic every year
safekeeper keep thinking tyranny cant happen ignore human history ill take dangerous freedom
something didnt cover wanted know car fair common insurance fraud maneuver respond time swoop squat
depend speed tire grip road condition computer without doubt respond faster human would able though help chance still better computer instead human added benefit autonomous car record sensory data going around used defend instance since lidar mapping large area immediate environment able indicate driver front stopped car reason increasing chance fraudsters getting exposed
tiaanva someone try theyd gone past fast lane clued something theyd slowed matched speed suddenly lane stomping brake pulling double short term trying make living driving big truck id able react fast enough id anticipated lot people could hurt back would word
would pretty dumb try pull insurance fraud car recorded everything detail
sihargreaves attempting big rig capable flattening vehicle driving isnt smart either
give one diesel car cost buy dont think car need year think year democratized sure people machine affordable time soon
never let sponsor change way make video
honda sk
cutest car ever made homiethat car gaaaayyyyyyyyyyy
car enthusiast like play simulator game happy balance every thing please dont computerise every thing
probably market manual car closed track
safekeeper yeah probably go route horse riding
must test entire fleet empty city see interact well together
driving fun many people wont want autonomous car good way taxi public transport dont think autonomous driving going replace human driving soon
people probably didnt think horseless carriage automated elevator would catch either
bring car manhatten let see happens
bring rome naples milan square street lot small oneway twisty street germany google map due privacy law almost existing
thing though car driverless always unpredictable element end im interested never driving may safe operate motorcycle road dominated driverless car surely bet would take advantage system bully traffic would lead rule maybe restriction one favorite hobby thanks answer dismally poor training licensing driver automate process make people even useless
actually pilot actual landing plane autopilot line plane landing actual landing always done pilot unless im mistaken
everybody price would seem shame really selling intellectual soul damn man fool
happens wifi go
technology amazing want widely available spread one condition emergency stop stop car ai analog andor mechanical primitive better possible digital interference kind command passenger immediate stopping car reason multiple electronics error moment stop especially watching video radiationcaused bit flipping software error moment stop software tempered remotely cause accident newage assassination akin bomb placement car evil ai let face u seen irobot
work home
also autonomous vehicle want resolve issue solution home office public transportation use
neither remove car road selfdriving car drastically cut accident imagine theyre commonplace virtually one dy traffic anymore
safekeeper dont need remove car enough remove imagine everbody selfdriving car everywhere partner partner kid grandma dog food delivery second earth fit car dont planet one
airplane ar perfect example highly tested rule written blood huge separation multiple feedback plenty backup system meanwhile selfdriving car
video make sad really trusted looked
want one bad theyre awesome
imagine wonderful theyll people cant get driver license reason much autonomy
itll kill slower manual driving
ill start admitting naivety realise entirely waymo sponsored video ill also admit rediscovered video courtesy tom nicholas veritasium subscriber also comment section doesnt need another person either saying genius shouting corporate shill think big difference short segment advertising product unrelated video whole video sponsored company subject video disappointed derek doesnt seem acknowledge might reasonable point view disappointment two facet like view veritasium trusted source think way significantly mitigate depend content creator buying classy thing think derek could might include clearly labelling whole sponsored video noticeably different way sponsored segment awaken critical thinking faculty parttime moron like clearly specify even description nature sponsorship agreement rejected section much editorial control get impose longlastingwidespread clause might affect video oneoff start longlasting collaboration guess sponsor might issue even decision veritasium guy make whether allowing sort thing channel like compatible stated ideal
disclosure super obvious early enough thing would nice honestly dont see problem dereks channel yes channel change would entirely shitty content tho wouldnt commenting right
ewerybody course dereks channel he free plea youre quite right content previously poor wouldnt commenting judgement aspires little higher however channel set provider interesting information also challenge preconceived idea part ability depends viewer feeling though trust certainly interest channel basis view video meet ideal fact criticism seems dismissed found problem worth unsubscribed veritasium whereas previously highly recommended content friend longer
tom nicholas video reductive stupid
yeah lasted couple minute shutting title alone big red flag
nothing get cheaper lol
waymo us car design derek cute indian car company tata us kind design several year ago indian weird matchbox looking car
cool u like drive there joy passenger
cant wait technology implemented semi truck yeah many ppl lose job human always skill
reasonable assume system perform even safely open road cardeer collision please
hacked steered wall great future assassination
would anyone make hackable
safekeeper would anyone make hackable great lgb often say cmon mannn
agree silly human effectively okay hundred people dying due fault dying machine error worry isnt technology worry maintenance becomes mainstream multi billion dollar company competing efficiency safety becomes priority compete happens future company decide maintenance check every month instead versus death pay lawsuit settlement turn paying lawsuit cheaper course there always problem sabotage
commuting work bicycle terrifying often see people driving car looking road believe could reduce drastically road accident removing human driver
ive seen pretty stupid bicycle driver say autonomous bicycle allowed road
saddens see video rated well youtuber called youtube propaganda suddenly numerous amount comment vid calling ad wont disagree though find lame people realise comment vid theyre dissapointed see someone else make statement like reflection good thing changing oppinions good always right move bashing youtuber person made switch oppinions lame perfectly reflects big problem today society whole social medium takeover
yeah really disappointing
order drive throughs
electric car gasoline powered
wonderful car like take one ride
ive fan couple year saw video month ago absolutely baffled amazing quality great interesting topic saw tom video also didnt say ur right sorry u example quoted part report misrepresenting conclusion used trust ur video content dont know unsubscribe think lost many subscriber due ad mostly repsonse dissapointed ashamed
lost faith unsubscribed made single clearly marked sponsored vid also happened incredibly informative lem get violin
one place moscow road sometimes meh weather quite difficult lidar camera traffic heavy fast driver well let say felt way comfortable riding selfdriving taxi normal one maybe yandex selfdriving car well specifically thanks challenge developer act smart quite paranoid saw video waymo car stopping started raining bit like wut moscow might well bother leaving garage cant handle weather note worked yandex selfdriving group year ago participated developing car even knowing raw technology inside didnt scare yes might take closer decade surpass professional driver ideal state mind health id guess autopilot already safer taxi driver reaction time short human cant even dream getting close see much sensor two eye couple mirror could possibly allow fails far likely stop maybe cause traffic jam human intervenes thats far know road accident involving yandex car pretty much stopping traffic light getting hit behind textingatthewheel idiot failed stop
rejoice rest rose okay bye
every driver must see video
dont trust issue car dont think future believe encourage people use everything car whenever possible driverless car would cause people go absolutely everywhere car also think idea autonomous car primarily american since pedestrian bicycle unfriendly country come city
instead building clean reliant public transport every city muricans add car road autonomous ridiculous
never drive saigonbangkok
elevator analogy flawed driver elevator would equate driver car ie control youre still driving elevator human driver whereas car control youre driving
many death btw
guy assumes software operating car free glitch error hack emp short circuit etc never software error free hence constant need upgradesupdatespatches dont fool give control depend program written human programmer mind
thats nirvana fallacy dont want thing perfect selfdriving car dont need safe need better u already far trust human driver youve got rational reason trust selfdriving car
safekeeper enjoy ride
long computer work without glitching shut take idea transfer car physical life stake simple reboot glitch mean serious accident technology better human programmed fallible human mind make mistake
show human love tell others robot one wholl listen
super disappointed feel like ad one favorite channel
buy one like next two year
video sponsored waymo clicking back button nothing propaganda see
nice corporate shilling bro
word learned adam something car train
adam something good point train fetish get really irritating sometimes get need public transport he acting train entirely replace car yeah lem catch train house school supermarket cause place totally strain station within walking distance
safekeeper true think bus public transport also place car nice okay bur place like mine go car necessary evil
huge fan extremely disappointed would lend paid informercial without even head perhaps change name channel order demiveritasium
even watch video clearly state he sponsered someone told otherwise lied
someone like go drink every cant wait
also wouldnt go amd self driving car tensor core ml acceleration slower old person sudoku
took car wrong condition ab tc kill need nm torque avoid certain death tc say nah ur getting ill die wouldnt know better broke traction rain slammed brake ab would keep wheel locking make car drastically oversteer obstacle fully locking wheel would roughly maintain direction washing momentum
basically ai doesnt know drift litre fwd fully locked ebrake couldnt trust straight road tire popped like oh ive driven rim heap computer done time
computer take car made power weightsame balance human need able significantly faster around given track condition viable human bottleneck knowing car actually found going go karts touring car first year jarring could look see wheel pointing could feel weight transition much
might sound bit pessimist let car truck autonomous risk human forget drive one generation careful wish see animation walle people forget walk draw line
course well forget drive like forgot operate elevator wont need selfdriving car driving u much safer
need trying meet
need derek spread lie deception pay check
maybe watch video answer question
normally love video take sponsorship supplier commenting make seem like ad didnt watch gave thumb
banning car together use public transportation instead government owned automated car
never understood people seem think literally replace car public transport dont know even start answering would people like friend social anxiety cant ride bus ride bicycle everywhere people rural area without bus stop close disabled people think live utopia everyone life way one mental health issue disability
sign cant wait
ive suscriber watched video uploaded admit advertisement halfbaked technology waymo machine learning engineer phd ai wouldnt trust selfdriving car human driver need rigorous testing breakthrough technology achieve truly autonomous safe autonomous vehicle last choice unsubscribe dont want waste time watching video designed megacorps
admit clearly stated video sponsored cry river also engineer seem terribly ignorant uneducated subject thought people valued fact knowledge shooting hip subject hadnt read theyre already safer manual car arent even commonplace yet
driverless car absolute blind choice love veritasium video small aspect argument made elevator airplane compare car hope never remove team pilot civil aircraft better average person terrible argument win public trust
perfectly well compare car elevator sake specific argument making terrible argument selfdriving car safer humandriven car given two option one clearly far safe wouldnt go safer option
safekeeper current statistic limited biased consider event like cybersecurity attack far belonging scifi movie fact car error unpredictable cause fatality normal accident many yes robot switch gear better human probably control car perfectly predictable condition human saying safer regret move driverless car moment going late marketing lie control going produce next decade top sure know driverless car aibased add anything else
obvious question faillingbroken sensorcamera make sure electronic maintenance well performed autonomous car avoid rioter street stop button electronic mechanical driven car system hacked
yes car system course hacked like someone hack elevator make plummet bottom shaft thats obviously something engineer would make sure include designing driverless vehicle first question guess event sensor malfunction car simply come halt
sale pitch misleading statistic provide skewed get youre excited rolling new technology simply isnt safe yet lying audience isnt gon na help technology finally run dog people finally start caring cause technology already killed quite people failed mention also distastefully failed mention key role autoland software played tragedy asiana airline flight bring unnecessary disrespectful really expected one popular science youtube channel frankly embarrassing please try harder keep yer wallet separate science
thats nirvana fallacy isnt hundred percent perfect isnt good enough also one heck logical fallacy prefer humandriven car lead million accident year far safer selfdriving car selfdriving car killed someone
im finding difficult believe credibility propaganda response backlash fact still disappointing
found factual informative exciting vid read reply comment vid think fact guy didnt bother fixing uploading
sponsored video literally communist china smh cant believe derek would give obscene propganda world going end im joking
brand car
really would like see car handle rome traffic
damn science channel ppl comment thats scared moving forward technology baffle jus think ppl rode horse felt car come accident miscalculation would still cut ppl getting hurt think thats matter end day guess jus show human thats ready technology technology cant ready kinda sad
seem come video share kneejerk reaction doubt theyre regular veritaserum viewer yeah resistance selfdriving car bit tiring
monitor car yet recent news clip california show car driver turning around dead end waymo contacted said thanks making awareso arent actually paying attention route
also isnt law persom driver seat case computer fails often happened
also video sponsored car mean dont beleive anything say
trusting computer safety like trusting government keep safe
nobody much time one spot
comment calling ad bunch misinformation old certain tom video could guessed
yeah funny least get veritaserum traffic
trying say technology already ready use pr isnt ready lot work need done people say least year away right
dude literally thing driving around road today shown vid sure theyll take year become widely available tech definitely already
happens faulty sensor cause autonomous vehicle take life pedestrian child child chasing ball street hit child kill child considered manslaughter tell driving fast condition held accountable going hold autonomous vehicle accountable
ideally company would held responsible worry le take blame reducing frequency tragedy tech would accomplish
elijahbaley plan keeping camera lens clean im driverassist there way possible put people life hand electronic sensor rely camera put faith digital connection satellite maybe could ban pedestrian bicyclist
thealeons brilliant logic driverless car arent perfect let stick human driver although thats way dangerous kill million year logic afraid flying even though thats incredibly safe feeling perfectly safe far dangerous car ride airport
safekeeper im one hundred percent driverassist autonomous vehicle work perfect condition would fly passenger jet pilot
first robot making fast food vending machine gas station self checkout robot delivering food hell u human supposed job dont care trusting driver need job seem losing
id curious know would handle snow icy condition total stopping distance greatly extended
simple physic calculation hard temperature sensor camera complicated enough handle worser situation
mohammadmujahid would likely quick break check start enough car data would shared condition almost time break much break would always known
probably better realize late im sliding stop wont quite stopping red light brake lock
mohammadmujahid driving snow storm would interesting see recognizing erratic driver potential hazard like someone dog kid curb one might want weary advance
mohammadmujahid simple physic calculation change foot something completely different going slippery black ice traction real possibility isnt simple unless want calculate frictionless surface thing like dont even begin start green light car going way come complete stop may stopping middle intersection instead location lane marker suggestion rather known quantity im holding judgement see small town residential road country road night winter
say goodbye duis least year
one many benefit also itll allow people get home party easily drive okay ride car even drunk cut assault robbery people able get home safely
clearly connection real conspiracy cant nice thing video
whats point self driving car driver seat steering wheel sense
dont really like drive never car license always scared drive autonomous vehicle much better safer would reduce duis aggressive driver
question car protection electro magnetic pulse solar storm cause black worry aside threat someone hacking taking vehicle pulse could cause network car crash eachother road becomes autonomous break designed handbrake happens term shutdown preventative measure make sure smart vehicle arent affected disturbance

yes elevator trust hospital one used one used much even brake get hour remember grocery delivery guy got stuck apartment complex elevator god know long thank goodness spotted time didnt fear closed space time found someone stuck thanks cost short cut cheapskate
like anything else elevator mess rarely might hear one happens common building solvable problem one bothered take hand car accident occur every day thousand kill many rarely hear many driverless car problem rarely impact rest city like elevator building might remember manual steering cargo boat blocked suez week month ago pilot arguing lost control human machine prone goofups

autonomous car used closed circuit highway etc uniform lane embedded guide public toll road car must revert driver prime reason radar deal icy snowcovered road youve seen radar image say titan see vast area black thats assumed lake point advanced radar black represents data lack term return winter road would return confidence inspiring
concern privacy selfdriving car use camera one tool navigate road see everything everyone field view meaning happened walk past car manufacturer know well car manufacturer going handle data happen used part protest thats want know
lost respect
happens think worst scenario mean accident someone get injured blame
never ever drive passenger auto car never accepted public love channel ereck
disappointed video
mistake machine wont make mistake programmer make issue take time work ideal situation completely false saying compared video obviously advert
car fully autonomous tried hail one airport say doesnt go love tech single company today fully autonomous car limited capacity like waymo cant drive everywhere rain tesla drive almost everywhere require supervision problem solved dont lie people saying fully autonomous different preprograming car specific route action full autonomy need human level reasoning

tom really killed video lmao
im sure driverless car drive better mebecause unlike wont call better average driver thing im worried thing hacked im saying evil dude want get rid someone could probably hack car make drive something would look like accident
fyi driver could definitely average trusting people dont know normal distribution type distribution
video fit preconceived notion self driving car good idea failed notice entire video sponsored piece tell part thinking critically part advertising material portion video might well thought since cant tell wish id simply skipped
self driving car bad idea right technology mature enough potential maybe someday far future become safer right arent public transport safer remain way foreseeable future also efficient cheaper better environment take like space car
reminds smarter everyday support u imperialism sometimes yall bring harm good
corporate shill much

definitely like idea would like vehicle concern always would possible someone electronically take control vehicle intentionally crash dont enemy think would possibility concern would enough prevent owningusing vehicle chance

didnt expected promote propoganda like im genuinely amazed carefully crafted word coverup bad press surrounding self driving technology
unsubscribed
need carless driver driverless car
much much think cool driverless vehicle would like saw movie since time ago still cant forget fact there issue dont think anyone really touched anywhere ive seen entire traffic made autonomous there chance technology would advanced enough someone hack change something simple much acceleration made car move halt andor maybe disable brake stuff itll go chaotic way car communicate one another specifically junction surely there gon na criminal whod wan na use kill several bird without even lifting stone fact driving take step make sure wont die cuz reason involves shortcoming meaning youre influence drive way thats risky given basically software trust life dont see itll beneficial anyway normal person however itll help immensely disabled people older people wont rely someone take around think nice want tech go purely reason alone ill stick driving long someday join either group id happily switch since itd dangerous general
older disabled people stuck multiperson transport pick upsame opportunity today disabled people money personal autonomous vehicle
wonder car react wild traffic like india assume car left gon na slow try go left lane double trip time able stay safe side gon na modified according traffic culture
said video computer simulates every possible future outcome act accordingly surely possibility car reducing speed considered
taken credibility thrown drain far im concerned

speeding drunk driver distracted driver sign please
yes accident happen people make wrong choice news article tesla getting huge wreck driver tell holding steering wheel put full faith fully autonomous probably playing phone simply something never supposed massive difference partial full autonomous sadly even full automation mixed human driver still accident minimum caused human angry people think better test limit let say brake check hacker crap seeing chaos create impaired driver worst part autonomous vehicle really begin hit street accident happen finger never pointed human caused accident matter human everything pointed machine many people cope change personally like drive however absolutely love idea full autonomous driving vehicle commute work safer relaxed im scared change

kinda late xd
issue current autonomous car built around current infrastructure like ill use airplane example plane know runway combination gps something called il ground radio transmitter tell plane computer exactly center runway angle plane approach plane cant land without il transmitter ground equivalent car right camera functional arent perfect would better updated road specifically autonomous car something simple faded missing lane indicator could possibly confuse vehicle autonomous vehicle also need way talk like plane easy issue fix requires standardization
described train
iamlalala yes without physical rail could run electrically charged wire center lane induction car would know right spot one example multiple solution problem
curious would happen case super massiv emp attack
already take nap going work without thinking im going die crash edit still yr away tech long human take except
watched tom nicholas critical video veratasium video agree derek kind messed misinformation quoting unverified source etc clearly expect respected youtube educator tom right call im guessing serious concern agreed known viewer arent mug people would see facade question integrity selling compromising channel stand bit unfortunate tom nicholas picked made indepth critical analysis everything thats wrong exposed heavily biased unscientific approach presented video think case everyone make mistake live learn respected youtube educator think people see past faux pa look forward unadulterated content usually present surface thing video ok interesting impressive whole truth argument autonomous car always baffled yes taxi haulage vehicle make sense personally love driving get bored passenger driving enjoyable relaxing pay car big question public transport absolute obvious solution argument cutting emission congestion road especially city one thing could change thing flying car sound stupid even saying seems potential safe affordable personal commercial electric vehicle viable prospect future transport
car different elevator commercial airline people enjoy driving car emotional connection tremendous satisfaction yeah may safer keep nerfing everything around u going end backwards world

thanks least without sort override breaking steering emergency
coola fully paid sponsored commercial waymo aka googledisguised scientific education mass there sucker born every moment pt barnum
pilot monitoring still extremely important opinion take max early iteration dont think autonomous driving yet need continue studying improving technology dont sugar coat grey area still present also id argue asiana wasnt pilot error although play biggest part accident keep mind airline training program today dont even teach underlying system automation present aircraft instead present reacts led several accident past coming experience particular florida based budget airline specializing dont reach system work use
youre going make commercial sponsor name title
make bit obvious completely sponsored bud educational courtesy suppose

video really good reason shouldnt simply trust people seem knowledgeable wellpresented youtube took sponsorship get team put together minute commercial pretending video similar others channel say discredit everything channel always take information havent researched presented people youve never met grain salt way video educational way probably intend
propaganda fake information source listed horrid
one enjoy driving car better idea let wrap everyone bubblewrap name safety know right want idiot california think
realised waymo owned google youtubers made similar video waymo sponsored waymo ill unsubbing corporate shill
bet pegged last scene probs back seat driverless car
since last commented video month ago like jumped subscriber base increased fold million read many comment say thing dishonest paid advertisement something rotten one increase viewership quickly without cheating one get paid make pr stunt nwo also paid subscriber like deserve gained disappointed see much come driverless technology electric car agenda help environment

glad tom nicholas brought attention back video reminded never critical vigilant come trusting source intention really trusted veritasium making video biased good wakeup call must wary edutainment
absolutely
microphone could achilles heel driverless car put siren car clear traffic front get destination quicker
elevator comparison ridiculous plane landing far
train proper public transportation better
username check
ok unlike seemingly everyone else drop veritasium decade solid content one video response critique someone tendency making dumb kneejerk response thing occasion would quite hypocritical video obviously disappointing even response get feeling people arent really getting angry right thing almost people anger seems directed derek certainly deserving critique merely symptom disease way corporation use insane wealth horde influence public discourse lack restriction ability tone shouldnt dare derek making corporate sponsored video dare let company like waymo get away corrupting many best public educator
every time see woman driving think thing
damaged trust channel representing commercial knowledge dont know got dont like
people stop thinking technology magic wand solve humanity issue easily fixable short term noncapitalistic mindset sadly common lot scientist science enthusiast
environmental cost building car make public transportation still better option fact whole video sponsored selfdriving car company stated top video noted prominently top video description mention sponsorship briefly passing deep video make conflict interest glaring
stop using brain dont think youre thinking much take derek say face value
tom nicholas video
trust youve built year feed u ad youve seen future looking film making opportunity utterly disappointed
video highly biased look tom nicholas video named veritasium story youtube propaganda sorry muller fan year unsubscribing resubscribe post video acknowledging mistake
video fail ive lost respect
since demanded tom pinned comment video thought would already linked video sadly seems like full intellectual integrity
think best driverless car replace taxi bus truck senario every movement recorded google give youre autonomy movement city driverless car distopian one scary version
wanted express support help bring issue technology science public consciousness good video people want driverless car general one particular company doesnt matter make safer driving vehicle long safer
rly bc install public transit instead glorified expensive ai taxi reduce emission improve city function keeping planet safe ensure safer future youre really worried safety
toericabaker cant driverless car required produce zero emission nothing video suggested lawmaker company couldnt take emission account building vehicle thing happen driverless car could reduce human error traffic collision could also help combat climate change
lot people seem understand concept driverless car applied moment transport vehicle main reason company test tech prefer car bus sheer amount number field number end gathering data making system better faster period time lot people commenting lately also seem miss point video telling driverless vehicle may future closer anticipated expected video made go buy driverless car purpose inform indeed ai driven vehicle result le road kill overall efficient traffic management think questioning dull computer far le likely make mistake auto pilot already used plane train matter time get tech road vehicle first may well used mass transport company fuel topic likely going able make environmentally friendly fuel affordable public future reason kind fuel hydrogen example le convenient fossil cost making low supply
combination good problem error handled ai coordination car handled human unless know like every car road fully automated maybe thats good option require massive change
combination driver car driverless car consume immense fuel passenger mean driverless public transit measuring economy scale public transit win every time build public transit instead fudging driverless system actually requires behindthescenes active worker supervise intervene build rail driver safety crew already explicitly help carry people reduces emission improves walkability etc baap baap
erica always good option replace current situation think vehicle automated combination system good option
wonder much got paid nice ad
nice ad
irresponsible video disappointing
lol ur shill propaganda
better way reduce traffic build public transit
waymo taken action make sure arent dodging liability damage car cause
every taxi customer sign nda location outside phoenix whatever accident mightve happened settled court
always love build flaw take advantage play siren sound stop waymo vehicle cool
brian scaramella good point
exactly know anything theyd know use mirt sensor detect actual emergency vehicle like traffic light
error impossible machine make ha ok sure
whether good driving doesnt depend whether average driving told average walking would mean bad walking still fine everything need
lmao video great car interview getting drowned road sound
flying car way go
le worthless driverless car argument dishonset portrayal many pro con driverless car present thing video accomplishes hurting reputation channel weymo company opinion weymo worried money safety lead negligence gave u boeing max disaster honest portrayal even perfect would create trust lacking right
yes absolute scandal cant believe waymo come hard spell correctly personally responsible future car accident joke aside id surprised sleep night
twoplustwo point exactly obviously video designed mislead rather inform public driverless car indeed concerning
fair fatality rate plane much lower car aircraft disaster catastrophe moreover aircrash disaster caused human error yes definitely human capable making error machine whether flying plane driving car problem aircraft disaster big news get magnified news coverage news cover successful flight cover every car accident even bigger news coverage cause crash attributed design flaw dont really like ask human self reflect error try fix human avoid human error instead put attention make machine better
shameful youre trying manipulate public opinion suit false narrative corporate sponsor want sell explain company like uber abandoning idea driverless car elon musk starting admit improve fold order address current problem involved driverless car losing respect people used trust
literally sold dignity regurgitate talking point gaslight argument abuse viewer human nature unable distinguish opinion pimp
get paid dont lose integrity lose integrity might lose money well
would like see waymo try software european winding road narrow street medieval city layout know quite crazy road situation city every human get confused encounter first time cant wait autonomous driving though there fun driving anymore traffic massive speed limit speed check everywhere
derek advert waymo im ashamed fan long produce piece little propaganda pr lobbying effort
would ai landed u airway flight hudson would ai even tried thatalso quite unfair compare driverless car driverless elevator elevator simple reliable safety mechanism almost prevent ppl hurt something happensalso wonder representative incident statistic regarding human driver ai driver actually course hundred million human driver say ten thousand ai driver count much much human error ai errorshumans make mistake machine also make stupid thing meet untrained unconsidered situation poorly designed money factor
big fan super disappointed blatant corporate propaganda green alternative driving traffic jam already exists called public transport poor american idea convenient train
currently trial new zealand car see around amd end december
coming tom nicholas video ive got question much money video like make much one expect waymo pay advertisement consequently would anyone want patron channel corporate sponsored content
id like see video derek paradox supposed benefit driverless car world public transit exists especially considering one sided video attempt obscure fact
thats video though world public transit exists yet million choose travel car hence need driverless car
naive believe reason expensive car hugely dominant transportation individual people choice rather several defect capitalism
akashpisharody type lifestyle people choose adopt certainly influenced type economy country thats mean understand capitalism push people make choice drive car rather take bus like communism might push people take bus rather owning car dont consider defect though capitalism actually successful trying achieve seem want get rid capitalism different topic undeniable superior comfort alone vehicle considered maybe could reason many people choose car choose capitalist lifestyle
imagine knowing absolutely stupid train bus dor get america isnt city farm forest desert mountain cant use train bus america even attempting trying build train infrastructure rural america stupid ignores amount money labor resource required build much track train money exist whole world twice
anonymousnekokamikannakamui actually around u population life urban area right point check number think right make comment number easy disprove also funny name anonymous name
cover truly magical tech wasnt even aware called train ride thing called rail think would revolutionize public safety traffic problem truly wonderful time living
real also heard thing called bus theyre like car fit people instead started using regular route schedule rather everyone using personal car could probably effectively eliminate problem city
stop driving car

wow way onesided wonder sponsored company massive interest argument really liked video learning style super disappointing trust video make fact check every last claim going unsubscribe hopefully push corporate pressure
anyone interested tom nicolas made video corporate propaganda misinformation
honestly waymo sponsorship didnt sour opinion head shoulder ad didnt sour opinion tom nicholas video didnt sour opinion response tom nicholas absolutely soured opinion amazing quickly trust destroyed ive watching channel close decade way chastised legitimate criticism kept coming back get as handed comment demeanor petulant child respected professional far far worse johnny harris response already good hope take criticism heart stop posting misleading corporate advertising way make world best science documentary whatever longforgotten goal cant seem remember anymore
absolutely agree
totally agree disappointment
fair point albeit mildly passive aggressive could better
also read johnny harris comment video tf wrong
kasipromod johnny harris simply didnt acknowledge sponsorship ran deep sorta dodged main point response wasnt bad good either im sure hurt lot featured video like human react defense harris seem accept bit criticism fully justified may wanted response worth solid c veritasium earned le f opinion
sad see becoming corporate shill nah seriously made clear beginning video like text screen second voice video sponsored also includes paid promotion thing see video
veritasium name channel latin truth put minute poorly researched advert waymo complete custom list talking point straight company help push agenda use example airliner autoland system disingenuous bad taste considering people died seriously injured comparable waymo system way system set forget require significant amount effort check pilot something pilot turn localiser let plane land
maybe channel redeemed stop taking sponsorship
see dont get kind sentiment firstly disregard fact sponsorship often necessary fund channel content furthermore one awful ad absolutely mean someone completely untrustworthy take repetition
thorhc would imagine youtube channel subscriber consistent million view make plenty money already dont think repeated mistake necessary video constant display consciously selling one video made many cut statement element
lost lot trust uncritical ad
guy help installed adblocker clicked video got blank screen minute seriously really disturbing video act making bad video lazy read nonexistent research even lie statistic name fudge fumble far bigger problem intention behind crime heinous way corporation lobbyist try control public discourse therefore people attitude towards certain subject often without knowing example oh dunno take certain corporation coopting well established youtube channel built reputation reliable research therefore implicit unquestioning trust subscriber sell message said channel subscriber maybe something like driverless car good actually good people driving car bad bad prospect testing technology come area definitely question accept unchallenging manner open arm hopefully even open wallet

future travel already called train dude indeed operated without driver need first place
nope dude public transport future car really inefficient
tom nicolas right youre total corporate mouthpiece lost credibility

really wasnt holding anything hand even pretend filming selfie stick thats weird maybe veneer authenticity trying come one man show
review waymo sponsored waymo car left turn
respect video get making money critical examination minute ad waymo driverless car far driverless far rosy picture painting shill video
corporate puppet shame
wouldnt efficient could car move synchrony oh wait thats called train
well like bus yeah
train suck though
omarcarbajal though
kingkloo youve clearly never inside inner city metro train system japanese rail system
omarcarbajal live inner city good public transport would list japan bad rail system
dont want driverless car one asking except corporation never ending propaganda video dangerous safe tech certainly yet money corrupts soul
unsubbed watching commercial hope payday worth cheer
build train
disappointed video
shouldnt whant car street car inherently inefficient dangerous transport switched promoting rail bicycle foot traffic city would far better people live anyway video pure corporate propaganda
sellout
well awkward
big fk im never get car control fk fk fk
gave deserved
bike go channel wan na say
second comment
cat iii seems rely either il ml airport runway controlled environment dont think translates regular traffic road well cat iii problem pilot react proceed protocol would rather automated system automated time pilot deal dont think yet case would rather pilot practice landing clear day one landed time career thing applies come car automation doesnt work bad weather unexpected circumstamses would rather driver used drive car taking rather driver almost never drive long term big picture solution traffic isnt fancier car think walkable city public transport
sponsored video fine please avoid misleading people also disclosing whether video intended impartial reason car seemingly level autonomy car driving phoenix arizona waymo team manually crafted model city disappointed
journalistic ethic literally dead moment advertiser input video longer journalist content business channel name attached weymo literally running carpet bomb campaign manipulate public opinion ethical video would video self driving car zero direction company say abusive trust viewer place channel entertainment channel learning channel far concerned nothing say point trusted impartial actual opinion accurate sadly people separate
would able done place feel like would almost necessity city would car know go otherwise feel like extremely weak criticism
bradenculver failed mention implied car us lidar lying omission
kennethkho disagree completely doesnt mention every caveat especially fact imagine every city require mapping order car actually know know going car isnt even going know walmart unless mapping area autonomous car could rely solely lidar would reference actually go
mean car start somewhere right id imagine given enough time money could map every city town think youll able hop one right drive snowy mountain road colorado guess im confused expected agree isnt strong argumentcriticism
yeah kinda lying omission mentioning necessity scanning misleading best stop hiding ad science
stupid advert science
nothing science look word b u think u know
please dont mix cringeworthy corporate ad science video must paid well sell like
good educational video
mralrats educational video sponsored corporation multibillion dollar stake product success known infomercial basically spokesperson waymo infomercial derek indeed soldout
bricology video want driverless car road nothing waymo particular argument remain valid regardless sponsor video
mralrats lying course video waymo particular given waymo world leading selfdriving technology company potential trillion profit riding product one biggest impediment adopted public resistance believing selfdriving car safe exactly derek video come reassure public safe would waymo backed google owner youtube paid derek make infomercial educate viewer hardly public relation investment made nothing le
bricology first waymo world leading selfdriving technology company secondly impediment adopted thirdly reason think safe fourth google motivation pay derek make video nothing dereks motivation agree make
corporate shill liar shameful
find extremely difficult find element truth sans counter argument expected better muller pr ad campaign projected explainer clear dent credibility im sorry love work
who tom nicholas shame veritasium element truth lol
guy one intelligent unbiased person youtube
crazyshorts rare quality find reminds chomsky
yeah ok get bus know american infrastructure notoriously poor especially come public transport doesnt mean chucking vehicle onto road one ai camera control doesnt yet navigational reasoning ability human driver reason demand better public transportation
matter time bus selfdriving
theakorntree may true jt aleeady solution reduce traffic self driving
theakorntree there need selfdriving bus selfdriving mass transit rail system like bart operation since least need rail infrastructure along bus
would great american stubborn bus seen poor people cant afford car think would work best u uber style self driving car system
danokh seen ridiculous prageru video lmao
watching tom nicolas video explaining disingenuous feel dirty feel
oof dont think trust channel one
corporate propaganda want see channel amount misinformation video shockingthis element truth like channel slogan shame see
maybe started getting sponsorship money reinterpreted element truth mean long say something true video he good go posting propaganda like see package kraft say contains real cheese
given technology failed simple task making toaster get toast right every time zero faith technology driverless car video tesla crashing stuff hasnt helped case
hope selling integrity worth im familiar channel wont watching kinda sad actually
autonomous driving limited good reality human adjust driverless vehicle courteous people courteous people youll sitting backseat waiting forever chance merge also luddite disrupt lidarsensors tech cant solve everything sorry hope waymo folk paid well anyway
corporate propaganda machine shame
tom nicolas right could alot better video wouldnt really hurt waymo would build integrety id think informative really needed useful platform anywhere
well fair said sponsored
carlosandleon still presented ad educational video
pm fair kinda one sided look comment see disapproval upom thinking alright considering sponsored video disclaimer literally thr start
carlosandleon offhandedly well video might well written sponsor
carlosandleon human psychologically able seperate company pay celebs much money know even disclaimer still buy everything celeb tell buy viewer trust based reputation built year act happy impressed believe based trust ignore disclaimer thinking honest wouldnt lie highly inappropriate educational channel present kind misleading manipulative information opinion
unsubscribed trash sponsored content driverless car future car matter hope money nice
video gave pause veritasium information source distributor considering raft science edutainment youtubers sponsored promote certain interest still something surprise glad tom nicholas took another look upon rewatching seems even like ad even time
yeah really bum say card carrying snatoms owner
sadly weve known veritasium educational channel tom actually said word loud
osirisapex right id like admit
get bunch dork
edowicz hey dont care kind thing place internet youll probably fit little better
probably couldnt give sht unsubscribe dumpster argument waymos driverless car
maybe corporate pr oriented sponsored video exactly element truth dont get wrong im huge fan since beginning channel kind disappointment know youd much deeper interesting analysis autonomous car technology without company interest looking shoulder big ad true veritasium video know love
absolutely ad im genuinely disappointed least change name channel
got ta make
yeah disappointing especial considering size channel patron patreon didnt see number published im sure theyre subscriber cant imagine theyre desperate funding would worth putting channel credibility line
dismissed arguement truth based intention factual evidence thats good sign also there general autonomous car technology autonomous car technology xxx company
thatguyyoutube take sponsorship someone else rather company making video
video add corporate ghoul designed keep ever getting public transportation everyone watch tom nicholas video responding one go anything car adam something cheer
damn nice propaganda got
imagine practicing year still able drive properly
urgh take like lol
haha fair weve perfecting vision understanding surroundings million year evolution recently drive
tom nicholas dropped sobering critique video know youre far established squabble socialist side youtube letting go unanswered put mark ive thought stellar reputation btw minute commercial waymo nice
madre qu penita noel
he fact commented nicholas video pair reached impasse emailing video theyve commented response detailing impasse
one care socialist think dont
patrickobrian yet
sponsorship statement big bold letter beginning ending video biased video
thumbnail
dont think pretty unbiased imo mentioned brand name maybe twice
danthomas patently clear conflict interest dont see introduces bias discussion perhaps already biased
someone didnt make sponsorship message clear enough doesnt necessarily make video propaganda even biased tom nicholas overreacting quite bit
koka paid company hamper ability speak negatively even fair criticism video subpar channel term depth explanation clearly doesnt want u think deeply autonomous vehicle embrace propaganda
brings plane crash argument automation report crash say happened automated system really saddens see youtube educator becoming mere outlet corporate propaganda know thats awfully loaded word use thats end day think automated car promising future lot misinformation videoomitting important nuance service point
request car speed suppose late
love veritasiums work shear lack mean shear lack critique current issue regarding driverless car nothing sorry say piece corporate propaganda
saw tom nicolas video well
thatguyyoutube
liked channel enjoyed many video dont enjoy propaganda unsubbing
matter fact see heart isnt completely video wonder wil make reread comment make concious decision watch hmmm anyway cool vids mostly
tom nicholas anyone like video guy point one fully point
fully error tom video found didnt understand car could communicate would indeed lead le congestion traffic though would require teamwork multiple car manufacturer thats never going happen
elisuql scummy corporate shill basically long commercial disregarded crash occurred driverless vehicle oversold underdeveloped technology
astlast yeah thats action far bigger problem intention behind crime heinous way corporation lobbyist try control public discourse therefore people attitude towards certain subject often without knowing eg oh dunno certain corporation coopting well established youtube channel built reputation reliable research implicit therefore unquestioning trust subscriber watch channel content sell message said subscriber driverless car good actually good people driving car bad bad prospect testing technology come age definitely question accept unchallenging manner open arm even open wallet
somecuriosities indeed
elisuql science fiction current tech level
corporate shill unsubbed
video sponsored waymo stopped listening
hiding ad behind science sleezy thing ever
osaabd sleazy commonplace unfortunately look monsanto exxon tobacco industry century ago etc

two thought first want car bed back actual bed rail slide safety lem nap lounge read comfort second real dilemma selfdriving car gon na get spare organ since one used transplant come people die accident car accident eliminate car accident therell huge drop donated organ gon na push cloning course take bunch water becoming scarce climate change mess im saying
ad technogadget given fact supposed education channel sponsorship concerning supposed trust everything briefed beforehand say talking approved sponsor product showing said sponsor
watch video take everything grain salt research nothing video actually wrong harmful way watched guy vid form opinion read research
summary analysis asiana airline flight incorrect honestly offensive blaming crash pilot investigation crash blamed automated system misusing tragedy like upsetting
kinda lost veritasium money think video one sided manipulative lot truth bending
tom nicholas cherrypicked quote imply ntsb blamed automation actual word report national transportation safety board ntsb determined probable cause accident flight crew mismanagement airplane descent visual approach pilot flying unintended deactivation automatic airspeed control flight crew inadequate monitoring airspeed flight crew delayed execution goaround became aware airplane acceptable glidepath airspeed tolerance actually spreading misinformation
veritasium since youve clearly seen video comment rest substance seriously dispute video sponsored ad think youve done u used trust quality video information contained within huge disservice
veritasium report say pilot chose wrong automatic function autothrottle think unintended part actual word report whole video ready go full automation making money say tom nicholas whole video questioning part money side want talk want say misinforming ignore rest video

harsh unforgiving winter ie snow ice work wed love see waymo way driving condition saw far driverless car fine sunny beautiful weather condition
million mile training sunny suburbia think waymo state car pull wait better weather besides team scan pre determined road beforehand constantly monitor car warehouse glorified theme park ride
plus almost million mile exact environment return vastly diminish time
karkof thats great strategy bad weather last minute hour great last month
thats autonomous level mean fully auto controlled condition level talking able drive anywhere time matter weather condition level
case level autonomy controlled condition nothing big dog pony show customer could get buying engineer loved one executive get selfdriving vehicle let prove worth inclement weather driving condition like blizzard heavy downpourfor hour could repeatedly self driving car worth getting
make realise much public transport need think error seeing autonomous vehicules main solution traffic road safety
absolutely agreed
well could work bus transit option yeah car current size
allow introduce ya something called capitalism
consider tho driverless train
agree japan awesome high speed rail system coming
feel like ad personally think irresponsible veritasium take sponsor direct stake content video he making though informative video heavily onesided given sponsorship concerning
hard agree
definitely agree
tom nicholas
kaprolax think guy wrote tom video
damn right
best way promote self driving car reducing drunk driving duis madd bar hopper finally come together
imagine calling one ride getting one full vomit
glad acknowledged early video mainly functional certain place usa country road similar waymo experience human driver
government decide travel travel travel nah
thing need hurry ban inferior human driver causing accident model year vehicle produced globally autonomous even pedal steering wheel allow oldschool steeringwheelequipped one public road get
know going asshole corp car company thats going design autonomous large truck drive faster cut everyone
distractable see ferrari gto think
derek great commercial youre talented
exactly sell rich future rest u pushbikes fkn bus keep car dont fall lie
georgecostanza dont think he sellout think car evil also respect derek lot
mgevirtz evil wow
georgecostanza thing evil car decidedly evil
georgecostanza lol true also system bad car company greedy ignorant
want carless traveler
would curious see would handle flat tire
im going guess people dont like driverless car never actually taxi talk scary thats human driver
compelling argument find taxi scary self driving car instead
real question though cosmic ray bit flip affect car ever really fully rely autonomous vehicle
thats actually interesting question id love see video
ahhahahahhahahahhahhhahha
facial expression beginning say loss control big obstacle squaring liability going nightmare think end like taxi maybe road
liability issue country liability culture like usa rational land important thing whats safer autonomous vehicle safer human driver thats done decided
dont think loss control big issue personally rather wont matter compared freeing time something besides drive spend well hour road every day work well time id much rather squander watching something streaming service playing game maybe even something productive course point potential downside tech free thing traveling distance routinely le hassle consequently likely lead car road traveling average much like building freeway led dream suburbia consequently lot traffic rush hour traffic downside thereof
jamesrindley think vast amount algorithm development still fall short sheer brain power response time human capacity adjust thousand stimulus change simple nuance driving car continue elude non rational computer matter sophisticated even safer think people willing forgive person accidental death machine liability important keep people accountable problem mistake machine liability degree magnitude larger vast amount people company working behind scene many smaller company like uber lyft sold autonomous vehicle division reason may well happen future problem dont know dont know
axterix would fun worry commute sixth day movie arnold schwarzenegger show kind would like people talk find people like control vehicle like go faster get sooner many like feel driving power transit system utah people take think take longer listen book podcasts truck commute educational period time dont see need maybe behind time
futurefuels might forgive person accidental death asshole race road deliberately drive recklessly drive drunk still accept machine demonstrably drive safely progress ai amaze everyone wasnt long ago people said machine could never beat human chess even grand master cant get close beating computer said go hurdle fell machine translation seemed impossible google translate get better better driving another computational problem id say obvious solved question
define technology ready question need answering vehicle drive nearly road condition around world technology affordable fitted every new car
guy refused use elevator instead used stair probably best thing live longer driverless elevator unsecure lot cardio training every day
thats ditch car design city around public transportation bike walking make city conducive human being reduces pollution encourages healthier habit
yeah also free walk city city please seriously though standing train still healthier sitting traffic twice long
greatcesari free walk city city able walk grocery school shopping drink live small town yet dozen option within min walk thats given newer american city due car centric layout even sidewalk given
andreas live city metropolitan area million people still school shopping grocery within minute walking
marcelo good u people lucky consider older set le ambulatory amputee blind mom kid tow awful weather always serious consideration young healthy lucky entitle remove transportation option le
comparing use lidar versus camera vision tesla wonder camera vision could fooled painting tunnel wall wile e coyote fashion
always wonder predictability function hardcoded softcodes semi hardcoded driving much fun sex yah ill drive
anyone notice car still mirror
mean id hope
traffic jam would gone schedule selfdriving truck heavy vehicle operate night nonrush hour
ngl kinda kinda want sit one lol may exactly yet coming faster think
still think might bit optimistic extreme weather condition would probably prevent car performing correctly yeah california work alaska
car need map city pre done level driving work city right
referring something still development plane land condition worse describe pilot ao alaska harder impossible wait
nixl plane land extreme weather myriad sensor landing assist device ground guiding plane road dont car everything
try throwing one thing genova italy would definitely function
flubnub take human touch tech advancing scary fast there nothing sacred biology silicon
fully autonomous vehicle never allowed road pedestrian cyclist non autonomous vehicle aircraft work theyre isolated traffic sensor world didnt stop one autonomous bus olympics driving blind athlete
japanese judoka aramitsu kitazono knocked epalette autonomous transportation pod walked dining hall athlete village tokyo last thursday vehicle human control time accident toyota ceo said actually argument opinion
fear driverless car come driverless car come donkey road least plane flown professional autopilot system isnt fail due donkey pilot accidentally coming wrong runway
big reason people fear control factor safety factor talking hitting person another car even car driverless happens someone want hack system system happens someone pump useless data ai make make bad decision great driverless technology happens attacked easy thing someone worked big data need happen someone deletes certain data pool ai get information driverless car would back square one knowing mention byte flip randomly happen could make car make sudden turn something else yes come long way still lot unknown contribute people fear autonomous vehicle
normal person oh nice video legend promotion car company
horse dont race
never wanted driverless car flying car
want bad
im totally fine driverless car existing long never become mandatory know everyone relate dont see driving something see something get something allowed
drive fun drive fun racetrack could imagine one day non self driving car get banned public road might lead race track mud park built people probably wont interested expensive hobby
pmtgmcw live pretty rural area racetrack probably wont built aside prefer driving general passenger like im visiting friend id rather drive driven person ai side note dad take trash landfill navigating landfill isnt something expect ai would able top le fun people requiring autonomous car isnt practical everyone either
one worst part job drive job site take picture drive back write report badass would chilling desk getting everything ready report relaxing reclining way drinking coffee get job site take inspection picture go straight back office job site also driving as home would instantly cut hour half essentially doubling salary get paid get job done hour
coming want government outlaw normal car automated car safer
yeah video going ripped apart tom nicholas
wow right
pretty sure car would difficulty move indian road especially kolkata road
problem people fearing losing job overthink bad side feel better robot cashier hijacked nobody dy person affected huge company could afford know dont care
test snowy road hillymountainous road please
sponsorship shine one say based million mile like lot fun fact tesla self driving software based billion mile
somehow tesla technology still suck mean even le reason trust
daniel doesnt though
breakitdownbarneystyle agree disagree even tesla nasty habit blowing enough make want one anyway agree video gross sponsored content though
derek lying implied waymo level autonomy fact testing phoenix arizona waymo team manually created model city
insurance company watch
ahh another video paid shilled google
accident arizona pedestrian killed least mentioned sponsored video yes also person fault seems glaring obvious omission else omitted
would love go one insecure would trust fully rural area like see deer coming forest would
get ready future gon na cool problem would live world thatss awesome know rest disastrous would explain cause yall know happens
hey fsd tesla right want ride wi need premap road crazy expense ugly radar p texas traffic actually real crazy
like old man road dont trust ai life
damn im bad driver need
want autonomous vehicels
yeah lidar feasible mass deployment car cool proof concept really indicative state technology atm
awesome waymo thats cool automated vehicle could drive keep track could read surroundings
every single time see accident get irritated terrible driver want self driving car everyone asap human absolute garbage driving car
happens forget wallet purse vehicle passenger recorded would nice
ive saying since high school year ago fully automated car future become common driver operated car road fatality number going plummet
self driving replace trucking job way replace normal car self driving tractor trailer truck could also pair electric vehicle biggest disadvantage electric vehicle constant need recharge self driving truck time waiting would still beat legal limit truck driver trucker cant drive certain amount hour stopping certain amount hour
hope
problem driverless car outlaw driver make illegal drive driving one favorite thing world freedom great pleasure
wonder many people wouldnt give driving enjoy especially way driverless car would deem unsafe
fantastic technology also cant wait couple concern instance accident resulting say sudden malfunction car computer system legally responsible manufacturer also would car controlled entirely computer prone form hacking eg maliciously made go wrong waycrash something etc etc
question answer want help bought twin siamese banana market two banana peel would like help know probability buying banana market compare probability winning lottery thanks greeting colombia
cant wait mtl sure snow construction tho haha
mot either going useful modern infustructure older town city dead end street suburban area built fit landscape confuse car would also like car part service subscription one want car work much im legally blind hate admit ive discriminated finding job question licence car admit im legally blind interview plummet never report company said said style argument dont evidence prove disprove tone posture body language point driverless car would make life easier arnt ready yet one talking owning car borrowing company also tracking location aspect bother many people
problem though going company car rent like rent netflix video service id feel much secure public transportation system would help ensuring safety accountability resilience outside phenomenon like merger acquisition would become natural monopoly like waterworkssewage system europe yielding stable low price rent
patricia yo check vid bot
well dont call human fault people trusting enough computer ever work
said fatality cyclist killed guy reading book instead paying attention car
think robotic total station used surveying example semiautonomy initially point instrument various prism target turn many set angle wish battery dy took time instrument develop point comfortable turning angle measuring distance automatically eventually better faster wrap manually
live anchorage alaska could always get warm car plus crappy driver
already happens beautifully india
feel like commercial issue many fully autonomous car remote driver monitoring limited area tech ready used every road every weather condition
basically commercial sponsorship video mean anything say approved company there way could ever criticize
whats wrong remote driver
zetacheese search youtube called tom nicholas educated thoughtful critism video
lamborgini would failed tech cuz cant used many part world including state road unsuitable car village either fairly common type road best city world perfect flat smooth road
comercial
cant wait sure take forever happen car money aint going let happen
there something inspiring race able accomplish ai technology flip side there something kind sad little effort put thing rely machine tech whether instant coffee pod instant pot meal self driving vehicle meant convenient get used thing easy whenever something used considered easy come daily life relate distressing wait grind whole coffee bean steam milk use espresso maker make latte screw ill buy pod next week
blame working culture hard time motivated anything day spent sleeping another spent working spent personal responsibility leaving tiny scrap freetime
politely disagree really enjoy video keep good work problem machine cant better job human problem ability monopolize transportation naive think company play fair ton competition case amount job require driving staggering number job dose aswell everything becomes automated im capitalist believe free enterprise let real replaced autonomous machine really think enormous corporation even spare u bread crumb universal pay never exist dose never enough idealistic think otherwise equality opportunity become even far fetched wish dont like il still like video
cool commercial man congrats
elon musk playing gta real life
le impressive expected see highway driving system developed country le populationdense area simple pedestrian tripped european city god forbid le developed crowded country chaotic aggressive dense foot motorcycle traffic timid insecure thing simply come standstill waiting break traffic never come calculating margin safety exist theyll figure long way go
much love driving people simply stupid comprehend driving kinda need hard stuff like use blinker stop middle highway reason
actually entirely possible driver average median average really terrible driver
driverless car public transport
driverless car great getting around bad pedestrian id want driver seat backup measure cant trust ai completely hell guy video easily computer glitch cosmic particle flipping nope nopenopenope life worth glitch crash im operating vehicle thats dumb as dont wan na die cuz seu said accelerate instead brake im reassured asking waymo rep waymo vehicle safe course theyre gon na say yes theyre stupid car autonomous people sell still human lie
yahyabenhissoune there one blame company automated car accident even cant even blame seu every single electronic one like time time human accident lesson carelessness automated accident rolling die see youre gon na get hit car today
paused right said thought say sit say automatic car like elevator im never gon na get hate elevator
there looter rioting street boxing need run people need voice activated override hey car activate anti antifa mode
hey bud know antifa stand sound like youre antiantifa youre fa
never like auto drive car believe electric part work part demanding part chain break making vehicle crash like main computer break computer fails cant stop sensor fails computer think nothimg way lot car like someone hack delete code car crash robot never better human one hack u hack robot

many life saving medical surgery oppression involve automatedwe trust thosw still people affraid autonomous car sound silly illogical
listen
livelihood depends truck driver fully automating vehicle kill tonne driver job
elevator go one dimension plenty precise sensor autonomous car navigate two dimension plus watch obstacle third dimension using sensor misinterpret think car maim kill lot people introduced fleet even car road dangerous fixed point inevitably fitted visual radar electronic warning marker
city line road covered snow half year car know drive
know drive way human know drive snow using surroundings make accurate guess road anything possible train ai make even accurate decision human car drive road create internal map share car continually update everytime find error map data thus allowing drive without road line necessary
wonder courtesy factor like car example car let another car

dont ever see one video showcasing amazing technology construction zone want see one decipher temporary signage figure line define lane deterred lane shifting side median merging due lane closure bumpertobumper traffic keeping passenger calm

arent people talking danger one driverless car remotely piloted hacker worse increasingly powerful government know movie remember innocent person driverless car remotely controlled bring right corrupt government hand crime didnt commit minority report
irrelevant already hijack take control nondriverless car enough drivesupport system
lorem comment either irrelevant rude enough drivesupport really making point already possible hijack car thats le autonomous youre going make even easier intended driver even le direct control vehicle like saying safety concern juggling chainsaw irrelevant already dangerous juggle knife irrelevant
jackwilliam point selfdriving capability car make difference since shown possible take control vehicle throttlebywire breakbywire technology wich already widespread car autonomous people dont seem voicing concern car disagree point disagree concerning selfdriving vehicle particular
white hat already told tesla company software firewall shitty enough someone control one car home desktop
lorem comment neither irrelevant rude dumb sorry dont mean rude truth
america law someone still driver seat ready take car least think
hows hows capturing video

hitheshs yes literally im judging anything pointing he oneman operation
daniel look show seat cameraman look dereks hand like holding something even
taxi uber truck driver able find job easily happens right
driverless car accepted elevator designer safety system pull cpu autopilot hwy speed
believe work drive bangkok
would like one test bangkok work trust
prefer control vehicle honestly
id love thisi dont drivei never driven still driving lisence long safe reliableid love
honestly think impossible machine make error delusional ignorant there still possibility something malfunctioning even small
many error made human driver across continent short time took u write comment
melnqre thats point making seem like perfect flawless possible something could happen yes human make error time even try rely tech often might error two even sophisticated technology arent perfect there still possibility something could break malfunction
big question wether algorythm car prioritize survival owner personally think autonomous car always make decision protect owner
friend insulted put seatbelt yeah go figure friend anymore said somethign line put seatbelt dont trust good driver answer maybe trust best driver world like billion idiot planet worse driver might avoid possible accident make sure idiot hit despite good driver hold philosophy selfdriving car said video incident car stationary people hit see think superior robot driver know safer know replace car actually driver fear right fear billion driver wo selfdriving car next odd year old timer collector poor people driving lemon car cant afford new car tractor bus drunk driver drive non autonomous car suicidal car want plant non autonomous car concrete wall care way agitated rookie driver think speed reckless driving part cool street racer alzheimer grandpa driving coup deville anymore one want forcibly remove license ton example matter fast car react predict drive defensively etc prepared make completely safe everyone every single person planet drive autonomous car programmed robot wildcard human fear even talking terrorist hacker would love turn stephen king maximum overdrive reality old movie worth
nice drink beer way work lol
technology cool useful whole wow read book way work achieved public transport well know original thought
public yuckyyyyy ewww would want help
toericabaker pretty sure joking case arent public transport suck thats havent invest enough public transportation purposely underfunded due automotive industry lobbied city build prioritize infrastructure around private vehicle rather encompassing public transportation system
oakoakoak yes im joking poor
sub bike adam something love public transit kc gon na get rail extension covid happened city drank budget project
toericabaker thats really frustrating there trade school want go thats like minute walk train station freight go town reason like minute drive town
car better people automatic car equal le death
way commercial autonomous car work everywhere build infrastructure certain hightraffic area autonomous car lane
one major problem make sure camera sufficient resolution first man died tesla autopilot caused camera able distinguish sky similarly colored semi well watching movie get perfected definitely save life
best thing fully automated car could communicate one another like there need traffic light sign even signal become useless automated car ecosystem
personal data sent
id love able sleep commute biggest benefit see making transportation lot accessible people without vehicle public transportation infrastructure need costly subway fleet self driving car
see video tesla driverless system going directly pedestrian
shh commercial dont want hear legitimate critique
car spend time parked argument miss duty cycle problem problem time car road happens hour car get driven pm pm idea need total fleet car wrong need car hour per day probably car rest day
potential future get car tell take store car determines received booster shot drive vaccination center instead
bigger implication autonomous car criminal step front car car stop second criminal break car window robs gun point
self driving car greatest threat freedom ever today interconnected technology self driving car capability controlled remotely imagine government would capability look happened since covid mask mandate business shut mandatory quarantine home various state there lot executive order allowed cross state line visit relative go vacation home north go church imagine government power keep people home removing ability drive car government control bus subway railroad air travel government control form travel except foot bicycle horse car autonomous car give government control last form reliable transportation dont tell ridiculous weve lived past year half lockdown quarantine capable dont give mean shut car stop autonomous car threat freedom here scenario call made armed robbery progress local gas station based police immediately demand vehicular traffic within mile radius stopped given police demand autonomous vehicle brought stop thereby standing people car armed robber area here another scenario severe winter storm forecasted state police analyse situation determine road safe traffic period hour give time storm pas road crew clear snow major road given determination state police demand autonomous vehicle prevented operating hour period area snow storm large city like new york city lot traffic jam order reduce traffic could limit number car allowed certain area image city traffic authority able decide drive drive certain area imagine government always good reason action always exception need get elderly mother help stopping car mean dont make hospital dont pick kid school extracurricular activity mean get stranded middle violent riot trying escape remote location middle blizzard autonomous car allow scenario making possibility remote control car possible dont trust second government wont immediately look gain remote control government proved past year half willing take unconstitutional action limit right dont open u possibility control consider cancel culture imagine scenario whereby certain people allowed travel expressing way power dont like antivaxers mom speak school board meeting trump supporter prohibited transportation autonomous car company doesnt like end myriad way autonomous driving car become way control people whether vaccination status political affiliation carbon footprint celebrity status social credit score metric autonomous car provide simple way powerful control rest u
cant wait hate driver road distracted slow rude inept imagine car anymore walking street flag empty autonomous vessel insurance maintenance registration fee etc
make system least standard mandatory car turn right collect data also make data sharing car compulsory whole lot control mechanism also system open review proprietary black box share feeling technology yet ready least mass production due cost another thing communicating driver intent bad weather condition exotic road vehicle like tractor bicycle horse
yeah yet collide kill deer road also whenever hear autonomus driving immidietaly remember delamain cyberpunk summoned car inside road texture explode
honestly matter advanced get prefer car human driver would drive really cool car
might really safe right human put automated driver speaks share land obstacle data end accident
minute long endorsed commercial sellout
price put lidar radar camera car make car accessible extremely wealthy one mandated people dying year backing isnt bad million people fall ice year die u problem dont make video sponsor bribing min commercial
cgp gray ballet car sound like overly futurist insanely loud due tire friction inefficient public transportation network allows many city already function le traffic greenspace significantly le noise pollution honestly solve safety hazard moving people around take sensible urban planning instead directing sizeable amount budget gigantic nation promoting moving around people time inside giant tonne hunk metal wish experience thats like try seeing den haag delft netherlands
driverless car sound like prison wheel
funny think someone walking suddenly crashed stationary car
really love drive car think year forbidden replaced fully autonomous car
video like make partially hopeful future im convinced thing right thing adopt technology
veritasium driverless computer driven car airplane future also veritasium single event upset cosmic ray destroy computer
solar flare also wreck stuff
autonomous car better driver human
nit pick accident collision change mind
like anything one program anything happen certain way also one never anticipate possible condition outcome driverless car could much better human operator catastrophic flaw series flaw could replicated million time human little random adapt quickly taking man loop impossible man wrote code wrote code automated code possibly improve life selfdriving car nothing ever safe
cant wait driverless car norm
would car work multiple driverless car shooting laser close imagine vehicle optimized suburban urban center much rural another curiosity place animal crossing like moose
yup thats like sand corn compared entire beach kinda data amount difference tesla
love driving freedom control sad world value safety freedom think future likely register daily travel every place go point point b point cect threat quality life control dont like change coming
exactly
mumudruid benjamin franklin said would give essential liberty purchase little temporary safety deserve neither liberty safety
would say would feel safe every one vehicle road automated potentially communicate real time would make le accident prone situation
mall like national handloom mall india elevator driver
autopilot car responsible killing pedestrian good advantage vine beer way
vehicle fully manual fully autonomous issue arise something inbetween
would amazing jarvis voice actor voice car
one shocked learn car tested public never agreed participate experiment
poll assumed meant large portion population driverless car believe beyond year future
thing drive ancient italian village local good
lazy read comment think world covered car like part since hobby driver probably still exist matter could keep world created car tech recording accidentsincidents happen car someone certain location could pull data multiple car recorded around location time track happened even criminal escape route kind like real life playback world least location car driving haha maybe install tech en masse around world cover ground
way back machine world
yes independent go want without tracked also enjoy driving also two good reason keep using good old car
said ill say thousand time ill trust giant piece metal flying road mile per hour get gps work correctly cant get simple aspect driving right youll never automated car road
gps automated car extremely different technology actual gps satellite based simply doesnt bandwidth every car road
youll never automated car road watch video automated car literally road
turn left norecalculating turn right norecalculating go straight forrecalculating gps great getting general direction mean level commonly available totally reliable whole trip
dont need know every car country know drive car react whatever happening front
someone never driven difference would whether someone talk trip
car sound like jet plane
lidar interfere lidar car driving lidar really viable camera ai way forward
trust elevator
even job going die great time
imo shouldnt investing much driverless car reducing number people driving car ie build train bus regular dont plan schedule around would save life simply fewer people would driving would taking already safe public transportation edit many car brain people think car good always cant think differently simply put way go fix traffic offer form transportation ie walking biking bus train look nation public transportation need example
yes
outcome autonomous car fewer people one autonomous taxi service
plus significant amount misinformation sponsored video
say investing mythical youre referring go ahead invest vote people support investment look like feasible investment car prevalent u two thing contradict dont get
alphatauri car heavily subsidized united state
oorrr could know sensible thing back parking spot see whats going pull going forward
also great way uber taxi could mean le people need car le car road
main problem driverless car sea human driver trust computer way driver best scenario driverless car communicate eachother
wouldnt take year go million mile average rate mile youre purely driving im counting charging time would another year charging maybe
long run cost evaluated car production actually full efficient mpg regular gas also really opposed food made gas forced new technology
best way many cab driver lose job
look really promising id like see car paris exemple would constantly emergency braking
glaring issue see making vehicle autonomous handle pedestrian traffic like ultimate goal remove stoplight stop sign make driving complete autonomous take consideration plan handling pedestrian needing cross road food thought something thinking past week
nothing would happen removal stop sign introduced intersection rather public area pedestrian crossing still still walk across road there traffic
everyone autonomous car like could make speed limit dynamic certain place mph might ok driving traffic jam speed could go significantly well imagine car certain radius communicated maneuvering reducing speed would become much easier would make easier commute city
flubnub thats meant dynamic view bad deer animal issue shouldnt high road damage thing clearly visible picked way away human
poor cyclist splitsec predicted rearend car front
nice retinal detachment eye suspect one look forward keep independence
hand foot driverless car every sadly main problem bureaucrat politician technology
autonomous car see jaywalker step front swerve hit oncoming vehicle kill occupant go straight kill pedestrian decide
car self driving car would still need traffic light stop sign wouldnt car detect know hit one another
yes selfdriving car also expensive actual good functioning car get long distance year never year yes selfdriving car much civil airspace travelling privileged problem poverty also kill million people
good deer control
anybody ever figured morality thing like would car save driver run others would whats greater good
would guess wouldnt built decision since would require brake extremely important
rose yo check vid eh would interest citizen secundary best main focus good lobby corportions apparently interest lie exact opposite spectrum since eg allow huge corportations buy immobilia throw renter renovate hugely expensive richpeople apartment stay empty make sense logically morallysocially somehow creates money actually democracy thing people people create like said livable city
mile done desert climate mile exclusively michigan winter ill convinced one bringing plane plane runway heavily winterized
begun recent testing michigan winter weather improvement wasis one concern well also hope doesnt swerve tree trying avoid deer popping nowhere right front car distance way close possible brake time crazy bastard sometimes especially wooded country road
uber taxi driver job
shitshow
bring autonomous car country bad road many brainless driver rider like india indonesia vietnam work already time bring autonomous car mass production
still dont buy driverless car much technology prevent accident arent driver car fitted technology autonomy individual plus technology protect trust entirely computer drive around youre really anyway there team back room people controlling system anyway prediction mentioned car fitted technology well even human better computer dont push human absolute faith technology afterall controlled someone somewhere improve technology car drive independent
cant wait skynet crash driverless car freeway kill million dd
well talk waymo car navigate road major city indian subcontinent
driverless car good avoid accident happen road drive safe sometimes bad driving cross car especially traffic getting onto road load traffic think human brain best driving safe sometimes safety important
im sold never trusted human driver anyways dont drive
k diehard anti realistic futurist greaseball musk fan disgusted remotely tesla
epileptic unable drive one would godsend
elevator still scary imo either way fact dont lie good thing
rapid transit better thing
im curious deal road work
love waymo trust car human driving count im legally blind
many bad driver road faster get rid better
day human allowed drive anymore best day life
computer programed copy human brain there answer human intelligent computer programed people think otherwise goodluck
dont want people drive
one big problem thing top ugly
car ugly
selfdiving car suck
people hacking car along computer malfunction biggest threat trusting full autonomous vehicle
dont think available soon tech lawyer
julia profile many state still law wwii prohibited elevator autonomous still operator push button thats push button could pushed
completely agree point concern driverless car isnt necessarily technology people people road completely bad driving want see driverless car respond appropriately completely imbecile road stupidest crap imaginable trust barely trust people im close im driving anxiety already pegged taking ubers wrong way driving people trying turn wrong lane right side stuff like car able respond appropriately yes bad case want see car responds fully trust id personally probably trust waymo lot uber driver concern still edit yes know situation there good chance human wont react time car react yes itll react faster reaction appropriate edge case scenario havent seen much also know cover weighing unlikely v likely thats said id trust waymo uber
year old strongly suspect live long enough see day car driver street roadway rare sight honestly look forward day pretty much place see human driving sport track kid born may never know hell went get far traffic fatality million traffic fatality year people alive look back u wonder stupid something inherently dangerous knowing dangerous autonomous vehicle save million million million life longer around life saved
im excited expand common everywhere
start checking see service availableit would make travelign much easier could call self driving cab
compelling especially car share logged hour experience though like want lovely ballet autocars coordinating uncontrolled intersection room meat machine like drive
would coordinate around said meatbag
mousermind seems even human intersection time would risk hitting assume everyone else autocar homo sapiens couldnt anything drive total abandonbeing unable decipher visual mess
imagine high schoolers swerving anything lydar top make stop middle road
hell nah prefer driving self way speed away
beneficial city life remote see downside
think would great big city sure would cost effective countryrural setting guess see
believe basically advanced ape specie driving opinion many thing regularly thought affect mental health horrible anxiety feel like put passenger danger anxiety cause panic make rash split second decision time ive almost gotten accident couple time wait fully autonomous road hope happens lifetime
people think average driver still possible hypothetical non gaussian distribution bad one would really bad
technology enough put stop police force reduced wont accident insurance company go business hospital lose money lack accident funeral home lose money etc thing create loss job giving corporation leverage underpay worker addition refer back video light bulb lasting year insurance company large let thing near future
problem believe car rely gps navigation however alot time road closed unexpectedly maintenance car would realize road closed somehow stuck traffic find way around
course thats basic programming higher ups
two concern least per day driving los angeles make fast turn onto street much traffic example turning left without green arrow pull halfway street watch oncoming traffic large enough gap zoom wait light turn yellow quickly make left beforeas light turn turn red see oncoming car run red every day scenario lucky get additional car piggieback leader per light cycle there loooong line car waiting make left turn im afraid completely autonomous vehicle either never make turn make one car turn left per light cycle furthermore often give headsup passenger like okay im gon na go white car brace bit autonomous car wouldnt able communicate passenger car become fully autonomous might remove ability drive car manually course citing safety worry there possibility unknownknown force decide wherewhen individual go way lockdown went dont know convinced wouldnt happen said look forward autonomous car driving car automatic highway lanekeeping game changer
hide whether youre good bad driver new yorkers allow u introduce
asian would like enter chat
test happens people want intentionally want hit themself car save like example want money health insurance jump car suddenly outcome likely hit car car save jump car suddenly say safe inside outside
know dont eye back head could
robot good hit human predicted
start argument le driver car hit parked car
selfie stick
trolling autonomous car could thing step road car stop
agree everything except calling google car cute ugly
jane yo check vid yeah way google collect data train ai genius couldve hired one car designer make body look good
wow would good idea could kinda dangerous counteract put car track kind couldnt swerve traffic track connect separate city linked bunch car powered single engine save fuel greener oh wait reinventing railroad thing massively inefficient huge waste time could spend half money engineering effort decent public transportation would objectively better every single measurable way understand there entire video jacking large corporation building technology evenmoreefficiently keep american good public transportation
let figure thing thats regular run mill boring chyrsler pacifica wonder wymo could build similar kit car ship u operator call center available need assistance bam money making buisness idea right
selfdriving car gon na next toy hacker play l
exception plane strong crosswind human thought better compensating im entirely sure really seems pilot think course plane auto land bad visibility airport fully equipped special radiowave landing assistance system help tell plane whether right path without plane needing use sensor otherwise detect runway without needing optical measurement also runway always straight flat always pretty good assumption clear obstacle road equipped help tell car straight flat clear obstacle car rely entirely optical sensor determine position road going state traffic signal signage various unpredictably moving obstacle soon going seem obvious would necessarily much better human bad weathervisibility especially eschewing use nonoptical sensor case tesla nonoptical distance sensor cut fog see well dark daylight monitor degree simultaneously big advantage though could also used provide enhanced display human driver
im sorry need amount personal autonomy life driverless car cross line
ive problem driverless car muppet decides fix home id worry
well sure want waymo right tesla legally required disable automated driving function thing seem incredibly dangerous nowhere near ready actual use road innocent people driving
tesla autopilot time le accident whats dangerous
cant wait tech make think tesla may much harm good autopilot meant drive people still people get angry fails
fully autonomous bus exist would greenest safest form transportation
get major crisis taxi industry around world near future
kinda warning system sensor get muddy
problem car driver
almost sound like saying waymo
yes arent using high definition map lidar dont think thats going good road expensive
phoenix driving doesnt give much confidence edmonton street january cm snow ground unplowed road traffic lane dont correspond line road could see ice goo sludge covering every surface car including camera temperature swinging c matter hour

also problem traffic due everyone wanting go point time unless transport many people still mean many car driverless wont fix traffic mass transit solution traffic give people option car

dont need car need public transportation
question tesla autonomous vehicle cant go goat track especially aussie outback
dont want carless city better traffic solution road personal vehicle instead stuffed polluted urban area plus driverless car think would biggest fail factor human erased
great thinking like human think driving however seen also people think way dangerous recently saved friend serious freeway accident forward thought see impending incident way became unavoidable passenger could talk rest day realised occurred driverless car allow much safer road experience even right new car coming assisted technology like collision warning steering assist etc car becoming much safer
lol go ahead accelerate inedible tell allowed go lol live technology always wrong hand
driver want autonomous car happening itd save million life
great thing never get speeding ticket ever
problem loss car fee everybody special car real emtional atttachment part suck feel bad im sure alot people ready lose car autonomous car would rather car take place stay waiting like loyal dog thats main reason love car apart look beautiful
im sure purchasing autonomous car possible
lol oil change required
soon enough
heh im michigan technology definitely year away
u actually enjoy driving even long distance good enough driver cause accident like jackass
use bus subway train
want smart watch know pizza level running low actually get low predictivly task car pick pizza know need one ditto pissed staggering round taxi use case itll magically appear front big juicy kebab beer ride
want know buy one ive long sold amazing
dont think represents side fairly present good argument even self driving car work flaw train still far better option highly recommend people research topic form opinion since video whole picture video try prove safe better human driver also cgp grey video self driving car inherently flawed there great video explaining flawed find searching actual solution traffic adam something
far better option train cant go exactly want thats like saying dont want use microscope already eye
prefer driving like autonomous vehicle would fine narrower certain purpose obviously wouldnt like replace
im sure lot people share feeling think regardless people feel eventually human driver road likely made illegal probably way line anytime soon everytime new technology come along like always people like sure car first started becoming commonplace probably ton people saying like horse wagon ive always used dont want use car regardless people probably fought desire continue using horse today probably allowed ride horsewagon around road nobody would say bad thing look losing something next generation instead look back wonder hell trying hold onto something archaic inefficient
dozen car passing firing ladar lazers fire messup reading
modulated unique pattern might noise return solid surface clear
really settle chrysler mini van couldnt think much lamer vehicle make autonomous
perfect choice want autonomous vehicle lame boring exciting usually ran someone crashed front shop
think great idea im surprised far tech come im licensed gt race car driver would hope people could either driving get better training
thing im worried put focus car focus make liveable walkable city
lol walkable dude walkable since caveman day liveable bro still breathing
like horizontal threadmills sidewalk like walle
turnpost ever actually tried walking somewhere tried european city really night day want rational explanation block design city u zoning law practically ensures walking anywhere home practically viable unless entire day
knightacedia today rode bike bike shop city walked back apartment one way trip kilometre way drove bike lane way back walked pedestrian lane yup live european city
absolutely never noticed bad united state traveled country saw safely ride bicycle near cafe store state dont store near suburb road built car crappy sidewalk lucky
im interested know fast driverless car would go would obey speed limit would go mph many people would follow flow traffic
guess dont know fact assumption would obey speed limit unless behind another vehicle going slower
dont mind self driving car coming onto roadway whats push every car autonomous like driving damn point get better public transportation need battery tire thing come owning car fully autonomous road
hell ill drive enjoyable
ok boomer
also bilion milesin city would take way longer lo thats lie guy talk idea technology self
reduce traffic dont need driveless car need better public transportation system
comparing something like elevator plane car wrong plane hardly ever change way fly co would croos plane theyrs way pre set car way traffic way object situation care also plane get view raw data car also get data self
way taken longer automate car plane technology close
elon musk like ahnice buying waymo
real question going implemented example know car electric would way le pollution arent cost thing going happen self driving car theyll available purchased one going buy cuz theyll cost much thats still pretty far utopia talked
example know car electric would way le pollution lot car pollution engine combustion addition manufacturing brake pad debris highway run etc electric car make car little better dont even cut pollution half
generally technological progress inevitable driverless car worldwide going happen question
every end video say put nice thing know much science mean science clear driverless car reducing amount death dramatically still dumb make opinion second know driverless car save life must use driverless car still far like year even decade away disgusting see delete life opinion statistic
bad view humanity think people basically idiot would trust yeah im fully automated road buuut remember people idiot would go way try cause accident try hack car make run people mess sensor cause crash cant human computer gon na arm race imagine someone hacking selfdriving vehicle there reason stop making drive pedestrian top speed ride bridge kill passenger grim thought people try basically killing machine riding street question safe lie control fear lie technology isnt ready society isnt
sound great hope weathertrain thing mean arizona snow relatively little rain even heavy cloud need cover type heavy rain sleet snow type dont want going ok weve got perfected ship around country like bunch texan road
think overselling technology rule last going take time figure handle person directing traffic decide someone directing traffic legitimately yahoo trying screw handle navigating around accident debris road handle traffic light handle inclement weather snow particularly come accident reported sure car may stopped need context stop right path cyclist cutting maybe im skeptical really bad autonomous car put road tesla uber
exactly sth like unnecessary stop parking lot could caused accident vehicle stand still
car move safely traffic prone city like london kathmandu mumbai banglore etc
exactly
car burnouts im
driving fun
waymo want learn faster go india
concerning car autonomous dont even need traffic light anymore well world doesnt consist car alone pedestrian especially modern european street many bicyclist sometimes whole traffic also autonomous car dont prevent traffic jam still claim space future autonomous car future much le car
much le autonomous car
im passionate car driving really dont like fast car changing worst situation cant disagree alot people cant drive save life
would pretty similar horse long time ago horse best way yo get around lot people people enjoy riding horse dont road area made riding horse likely place go drive car thats really like
flubnub good solution difference city design city europe designed way walking work store perfectly viable license unnecessary unlike u who city designed car trying walk anywhere practically possible making license literal necessity survival
thats quite different comparable issue hiring someone dont meet qualification issue indirectly removing someone ability commute job effectively sentencing joblessness ultimately lead homelessness starvation possible take great pain set life dont need drive ive done take good deal resource people would impacted decision could spare resource
jeffreydenenberg also called racing track
flubnub move kind callous response especially guy kinda stated people impacted decision increase driving license regulation would really couldnt anything youre rich enough might able uber work might support structure capable driving might carpool dont thing youre likely well enough move especially job taken away thanks fact cant drive anymore north america driving isnt option necessity many people moving isnt really possibility especially move outside u another country youve basically told move like mexico getting eu citizenship work visa really pretty hard real unspoken solution problem redesign city le car car inherently large number going lethal especially north american road intrinsically designed multiple point conflict design element odds one another relative say german design example large multi lane road something primarily used ferrying heavy traffic amount car intersecting smaller road via turn lane turnout necessitates frequent lane change creates multiple point conflict design thats odds attempt serve multiple contradictory function north american road often designed way simply accommodate fact everyone car scaling issue look part denmark netherlands use car infrequently compared say urban france better germany germany better north america
challenge car come istanbul
try go offroad
question would suggest whether make automated vehicle whether cost automating every vehicle every road etc finally reach reduction risk afford society opportunity miss via spending money achieve goal human cheaper cheap enough consider question science always pair context
truly automate every vehicle cost would negative painting line road maintaining traffic light making sign benefit human driver quit making steering wheel mirror brake light headlight blinker guard rail could scrapped need rumble strip speed bump reflector either top huge amount money life saved every year eliminating car wreck sure ever get rid parking lot could surely get rid
take year drive million mile put million mile truck couple year
driveless car must implemented globally quickly country otherwise end million people cant drive hence cant travel country using driveless car said put smco magnet around vehicle high coercivity make road metallic hydrogen room temp superconductivity make car levitate put hydrogen magnet around venicle car crash ever happens vehicle move using bouncing microwave microwave phase conjugation create master program remotely manages every vehicle city sandwitch hydrogen micro heat pipe reflective aluminum immerse whole thing running water sunlight ground warmth never quenches hydrogen sc hook part road battery eddie current moving magnet charge entire block district get assassinated big tech
driveless car must implemented globally quickly country otherwise end million people cant drive hence cant travel country using driveless car ah driverless car solution problem driverless car creates gotcha
horacebenedict completely wrong
people motorcycle dilemma head sceneraio unlikely appropiate technological advancement chance enduring injury human fault motorcycle driver likely higher also implies time even become significant chance happening meaning big enough share selfdriving car road motorcycle havent underwent advancement everyone wear protection anyways dont think worry priority
cant wade k comment test drive phoenix az hardly test driverless car avoid pothole happens wind driven snow cover traffic light car avoid debris road wade way though complicated cone zone well defined bright painted traffic line car drive wrong side road often happens road construction area yet ready prime time view
lot concern able driverless vehicle ideal road still incredible achievement car adapt unexpected
seeing driver observing dereks journey must priceless edit come desperate wait see fast furious vin diesel empty car
easy put highpowered magnet camera itll crash bad guy owns
way see lot people driving today would much rather prefer driverless car plus wouldnt much road rage
people ride driverless car watch good old road rage video youtube
better public transport driveless car literally automation taxi fine would bette seat people
rephaelreyes driverless public transportation public transport
redbuilracing expensive driveless car carry people bus carry might think public transport suck thats city made carcentric look public transport europe asia get without car
legoguy yes bot everyone drive car go work either city apartment cheaper implement super block like example super block dedicated parking lot suburban home add space housing neighborhood street doesnt need car wide add park small community space block
nature handle driving water freezing guess million mile plenty practice mention anything believe
nope dont like keep finding way make human le responsible making u le safe le useful people bad society
arizona thats question ask figure year behind
travelling night driver le car lot safer driving weird uber driver
one question go million taxi driver around world left unemployed biggest problem robotization general exactly dont give damn people working people potencial consumer unemployed people exactly opposite right
worry privacy camera
know mechanic cant fix problem regular car want take job maintaining repairing autonomous vehicle long would trust self driving car year scrap mechanical electronics something going fail sooner later computer system involved hacked sooner later well driving around
bumper car get lot exciting
cant drive cant wait able self driving car
sorry matter say driverless vehicle dangerous regular vehicle good luck one vehicle people discover hack purposely make crash cause accident mention emp ever actually detonate country car would come crashing halt mention computer programmed work correctly human error guarantee car end malfunction people end getting hurt oh dont forget amount radiation waste created nuclear power plant help charge vehicle even fossil fuel still used create electricity vehicle need run oh yeah electricity power outage cant charge vehicle either since self driving car electric navigation car also problem cant program computer good navigation lose signal phone dont tower around send signal expect self driving car know going time cant
still dangerous another car driven human road
thats plan get driver controlled vehicle road everyone use driverless controlled vehicle
excellent stuff sure driverless car everywhere soon
hope ill easily trust driverless vehicle anyone driving vehicle
remove various way people die overall equation die due starvation caused overpopulation
helped make camera dome first google car cool see video
beautiful creation mess many people money wonder itll actually ever become reality
know video youtube already would interesting see derek think connection autonomous vehicleregulatory body handle pedestrian intentionally messing vehicle forcing stop
best reason autonomous car cant as
ive worked training ai enough know patently false
watch som early tesla fsd beta video
could transform hot girl thats another thing
huskiehuskersonyou watched much anime
travelsizedlions dont understand as requires soul
donot understand donot need parking lot vehicle full automateplease tell
automated vehicle reason stop pick one location drive location drop drive someone else need
thatnormalbunny thanksbut automative vehicle net working dismissing ownership
wonder driverless car affordable traditional one seems road filled driverless car safer human driven car still im favour public transport one person must occupy space five ten people there option
love work vertazium
ive saying year car autonomous would auto casualty traffic would cost insurance company trillion dollarsand would anyone buy new car ran perfectly efficiently get run ground profit dangerous manual drivingand world profit people
yeah uhm isnt using train thing
honestly im ready jump driverless car tomorrow think anyone lived long enough seen countless drivererror accident pointless traffic jam able admit driving simply isnt something human uniquely excel like simple calculator beat human quick calculation automated assemblyline outdo team worker time reassign task driving best
dumb idea might well robot follow around wiping as spoon feeding everything human beyond lazy anymore
winter weather
riding mia winter weather ice snow believe human way better ai driving inn condition
really weird fuel shortage im recommended video full automated electric vehicle coincidence
bus public infrastructure instead car pls
driving zen experience dont want lose life
thats understandable hard judge rationally would lot better fraction death autonomous driving
alexbluh would lead better mental health better quality life would autonomous drive work relaxing time likely mind pressure packed prework period one already looking email prepping meeting etc would drive home opportunity focus driving stereo loud george thorogood grand funk railroad current playlist unwind day would another stressful addition work day know commuter different experience u enjoy driving loss affect mental health
projoebiochem decision would extra time could meditate example could read book liking watch tv sense great desire quiet mind would really recommend try meditating
alexbluh like decision use time saved put computer desk
plus experience driving different car cool
want drive
im truck driver think great
saw chick putting makeup today driving mph
also something said people care le day think self pas someone sholder go speeding
id love self driving car people day worse worse driving heck town alone week someone crash
think im better driver people
im really excited try driverless car someday
need preemptively pas legislation forbidding advertisement played selfdriving car vehicle hardware associated operating company
pay premium subscription ad like youtube
edgarfroes premium would buying car first place imo
tho wouldnt make cheaper people drive watching youtube right free ad
sailboat want go cook meal sleep need yacht continue sailing possible
id okay car driving long wheel front brake toyota driver assistance highway drive beautiful like like comfort able take ofc
pretty heavily biased video derek never even considered alternative viewpoint data interview content came waymo maybe let use car probably sponsored video im even disagreeing content dont think presented responsibly channel thatd meant come scientific
one people critical thinking congratulation
pointed mentioned sponsorship description still think pretty irresponsible edutainment content place basically amount footnote
sauercrowder mention briefly video sponsored waymo even wouldnt said anything whole video long format comercial pretty disappointing
alternative viewpoint keep people drive car went length
update tom nicholas done whole video
transition human autonomous driver dangerous period get point majority driver autonomous risk go human driver risk factor thats hard ai understand react
convinced work india road usa trivial
tell shouldt cuz hacker
hacker problem even driver controlled car especially since car day rely computer
ok practical would got ta pay ton extra equipment service people uber yea general person need vehicle ready ect impractical rely kind service buy cheap car le buy automated one thats well
behavior expected waymo push hard veritasim super onesided
recognized bad driver im distracted looking forward driverless car
dont think people good driving possible better average much worse average ie bell curve would expect fat tail maybe fat enough average incidentally people point high skill theyve never crash silly maybe almost never drive typically isolated rural area vehicle short distance predictability huge improvement people often far unpredictable forget human perception situation software lead often negative outcome
lmao driving without helmet make driving motor bike safer autonomous vehicle r road lmao part want autonomous vehicle send work taxi thing lol
near end show beautiful ballet self driving car well ive cambodia tell thats exactly drive today way honking
would put indicator sound car make feel normal
rfil want add voice driverless car yell human driver screw
emilia automated car dont rely gps use onboard sensor much much reliable human
try using naples italy
heavy rain
bro last week watched tesla swerve pedestrian got way go
love shout cgp grey end also id interested see fully automated car handle country backroads extreme weather design program like drive icy hill
wasnt shoutout subtle jab
need hire ppl press start button
omg cyberpunk
cant wait til two autonomous car crash try blame car accident progress
already happened
probably already happened thats arent common place yet weve got iron bug first
cant wait
cant wait
ffs aircraft autolands certifiable human monitoring good poor visibility think windy gusty situation asiana exactly sort accident occur manual flying skill abandoned reality aeroplane automation make easy phase flight easier difficult bit difficult going see thing automated car
problem cost car already far expensive car manufacturer charging ridiculous price even small city car top expensive electric model allowed year time driverless car theyre available sensible price
never gon na get one thing like driving like truck seems like step towards putting people position future private car ownership longer thing diesel technician see thing fail spectacular way unexpected result way hell would trust driverless vehicle
thing scare u ai car mark zukercar stealing driving datax
imagine caring youre website day
need unless also invent driverless bike
feel split driverless car driver car watching idea behind wheel epic selfdriving car safer though
selfdriving car accident would car
video didnt seem interesting im watching cu veritasium iwe seen video recomended x first time actually press idk didnt catch like thumbnail video
hate
imagine worker automatic car running simulation truck bike see crashing scenario would terrified
im really short friend say im driving look like nobody driving car angle
would trust self driving car top get destination safely trust get destination much faster
thing computer moral system feasible could ever equate human come complex moral situation occasionally occur road
car need wifi function properly could scary
thing know person drive trust one person computer driving car like trusting statistic average driver earth taken account justifying better like trusting driver world drive trust personal history driver personal story manageable le variable dont engage national statistic million milesdriven one driver right even mathematically believe nationwide number safer tough decision
real good driver never replaced situation make impossible computer make right decision fast enough good reflex part every day security road agreed driver distracted never keep head road ahead developed trick foresee danger like looking parked car window car ahead etc like buckled may save life head head crash quite reason may killed situation course computer never encounter bug right well least never trust computer life put virtual hand computer fly plane time sky traffic much le road traffic sort equipment warn pilot like tcas example
computer far better reflex responsive human though human take second even start reacting surprising situation whereas selfdriving car make decision millisecond also yes selfdriving car bug well human make idiotic mistake time selfdriving car dont need perfect need better u
remove car
board start video kind bet rush traffic would flow much smoother road well
want bow ai overlord
one saying year live rurally
im sold fact autonomous car drive whatever kind fail see autonomous car enable wouldnt accomplished like public transportation investment money people public transport le car road solves like thing driverless car purport also improves traffic congestion driverless car cant could maybe see world theyre useful feel gold rush driverless car putting cart horse
mean yeah want better pubtran thats really conflict robo car yes btw robo car would reduce congestion human slow reaction time cause traffic robo car le traffic
always see vehicle driven city perfect dry condition interesting step technology id like see handle driving tropical storm level rain like get gulf coast flooded street detectability ice snow wyoming gravel mountain road carolina terrible dirt road youll tear suspension dont bob weave avoid hole reason cant see driverless car replacing driver one quite good idea taxi cab city handle weather anomaly area known tend hope thermal imaging sensor help visuals standard vision would hindered due condition admitted distracted driving huge issue road day many people dont look road ft past hood
basically think driver assist least selfdriving car relinquish control condition future car possibility driver regaining control
therealwurstcase point shouldnt make car driverless car driver control never useful even fully trust technology id rather car something wrong selfdriving feature still get going
therealwurstcase sadly doubt anything result fewer vehicle likely happen current capitalist society large powerful interest area lot money spend lobbying guess may end battle selfdriving car service auto industry present one much larger well see happens tend think ubiquity still long way lot reason
unfortunately wont work new orleans long time derek said road poorly maintained driver dont stay lane city one worse case would love try riding driverless vehicle one day though
driver dont stay lane ok robo car still react situation better consistently human might need new training avoidinggetting pothole could definitely done
thank effort recently drove late model vw passat various driverassist feature none feature totally safe car react traffic back sudden driver cutting front car pingponged lane marking handle sharp curve understand tesla much better waymo even better tesla restricted street area anxious technology become better aging btw tesla reliability service cost game stopper
want auto
car going field day driving india
thing get interesting start fly
prefer something called public transport obligating people inneficient way transport called car
yea want better public transportation mean robo car development stop government magically start caring public transit
lf thing make city even car dependent obligating pribvate vehicle
naruedyoh wait lol finished video wonder bc point could greatly reduce number car make everyone le dependent would get city space back farrr le need parking lot private ownership
yeah fun getting irradiated thousand laser radar taking walk autonomous future secondly arent train automated yet
probably train already ridiculously safe also simple drive
think self driving car safe long made economic purpose would produced little money possible might cause error also keep wondering car hacked could hacked could kill people hacking people whomever like
okay hear carless driver le polution
he clearly afraid
uber get ground floor one
basically decision second guessing computer programmed follow rule exactly wouldnt need people actually followed rule started driving im cautious rule still fresh mind people driving year year lot care free said still much although many thing like driving cant perfectly cuz designed b limit weve always made thing thing u make easier made spear hunt better suddenly oppose car driving better u strange cuz google improve get information instead going actual library im scared drive cuz idk people gon na especially stop sign id feel lot safer would much progressive car drive u could get done going town trip wont fearful encounter way catch show complete work call family like people constantly busy hard connect loved one definitely think take large amount stress away ill say reason isnt actual thing cuz governmets lawyer make huge money accident wish included money side accident go cuz thats actual problem
zaniyah reagan idk im sure better human ive seen many mustang crash winter purposely going speed limit
get nervous riding car im driving
still havent seen autonomous vehicle pull volantazo ill cool thing see
one want drive car im thing terrify im car guy want enjoy big engine manual transmission driving theyre taking away im enthusiastic
mean theyre le likely make human error accident happened fault human driver autonomous car
ive idea could come away experience thinking tech anywhere near prime time drive differently human constantly presenting big speed differential traffic stuff stuck test track ready like tech industry introduces
pulling backup driver thing pure pr stunt well one endangers public end besides convenient publicity
generally im sold technology concern scenario like youre driving ride intersection legal speed kmph mph freak green light pedestrian red see mother child say yo approach side look pair youre second away passing theyre approach place stop dont dont slow run imagine see one child acting calmly mother holding child hand clearly looking right aware surroundings child acting calmly mother holding child hand looking theyre talking seemingly paying attention surroundings child acting calmly mother holding child hand looking child theyre talking clearly glanced child acting calmly mother holding child hand looking child theyre talking showing sign situational awareness child acting calmly mother holding child hand looking phone intently child acting calmly mother holding child hand looking phone intently child acting agitated mother holding child hand looking phone intently child acting agitated mother holding child hand looking phone intently question would slow least change alert expecting pair least child might stride onto road depending scenario case would confident driving legal speed case time im would pretty much slow crawl expecting something stupid happen question automated vehicle differentiate scenario
car road slippery
trained handle way human would lol
future think whattt used driver existing part car available people
feel like autonomous car arent safe road number every vehicle road sharing information happens itll probably ready

would like know waymo car would non standard situation coming set traffic light blinking yellow due fault accident police directing traffic hand signal
clearly issue road work etc chandler arizona
like drive
saw one driving around thats
tried tesla fsd yet
would rather le car self driving one
could come app press button car location within second minute ride cost cent would huge
tesla already come get feature say parked lot mall outside click button key fob car start drive come pick imagine time one owns personal car share driverless vehicle paying monthly fee fee cover fee needed run operate insure everyone contributes
eliminates need personal vehicle love
public transportation eliminated need lot people could lot invested
hi veritasium quite interesting video fully agree would love see car however something havent mentioned hacker car hacked certainly connected iot get upgrade manufacturer hacked risk need consider imagine someone gained control many many vehicules could huge mess endanger life many people would someone many motivation revenge kidnapping attacking vip people steal car narcotic traffic creating big mess town completely block political reason car u town get hacked chinese theyve got full control mean thing malicious person could close infinite considered aspect id curious know point view dont tell security major point company cause cant never ever fully secure youre always vulnerable right motivation side
question something ai could never beat human
hate
hansenswe youre right although meant term skill
horpuscorpus make hired skilled ai doesnt need eat drink bathroom rest
car wearing sit belt
europe lot roundabout wonder well autonomous car manage earlier iteration autonomous car gave notice driver take control whenever approached roundabout
question blamed even accident vehicle person sitting car
people driving car stressful dont like million carguys love drive car banning human driver take away one favorite thing live
million dead sweden responsible rest world drive like swede would death
think video onesided camera sensor work covered dust heavy rain condition snow ice etc car operate well heavy urban traffic like european city narrow street think type video show also pessimistic opinion complete
dont know really year enough l think year logical
like tech disagree video thats fine dandy arizona place dont map little map data different driving rule around world abruptly stopping like couple time video would get accident korea
year old grandpa would love car
dont want car car dumb want train tram beautiful bike lane
lol yeah would nice replace existing car much possible would lead le traffic
problem driverless car see much could restrict personal freedom suddenly cant go road unless pay explorer subscription cant lend car child friend didnt select family man plan big corporation even data whereabouts need strong legislation protect u
never buy one come disable

tesla got competition
disagree im fan robotics slowly unemploying every job imagine would probably safer human driver
bad idea matter look
want believe autonomous car take dont see human giving control like also serious implication thing like law responsible accident two autonomous car one example think far away
id love driverless car become norm way many unsafe driver road right
siren noise unmarked autonomous car pull officer evening sir noticed nonhuman like behavior driving style vehicle may see license window roll officer understandable good day
ah yes fine unhuman behavior following rule
rip cab driver job uber driver gon na find job technology come
please come india see good driver
dont trust autonomous vehicle tested proven safety indian road
would duis eliminated cheaper car insurance
lyft uber driver going unemployed soon
surely driverless car cool want travel onslow road driverless car ever drive highway also think autonomous vehicle computer wheel think many time computer something wasnt supposed see driverless car future possible mail package delivery
rider support agent sitting somewhere desk somehow better simply driver entire concept stupid always world stop turning techified nonsense revert back common sense aircraft little obstacle hit conveniently computer point flight take certain aspect pilot isnt choice bad weather condition even pilot flying ifr still technically flying aircraft computer guide soon light become visible pilot making correction necessary aircraft fully autominous never applies vehicle road aircraft computer different cruise control really driver still make human correction computer unable respond morally situation programmable road
stepping inside self driving car going feel natural ur absorbed ur phone notice lol
movie upgrade point disadvantage hacking ai controlling human life
job issue alone enough make shunned driverless car
think want convince people driverless car need put fear ease important also show exactly experience like real world example know getting video didnt even scratch surface definitely good video first one fear well rare edge case accident wed like think would never happen also standard one car really going react saw example never actually answered question everyone asked year ago car kill save someone el life multiple people yes unlikely situation people still want know answer also software hardware exactly software used car software communicating quality assurance software undergoing many update software since release releasing new software look like failed test software consequence failed test also hardware rate failure take operate type maintenance require handle weather start hail outside hardware get damaged handle flat tire something else going wrong hood answer many question would help alleviate fear second one actual experience let remove fear equation sec pretend totally board okay well actually driving car like fast go recognize school zone speed limit reduced mph handle speed bump speed hump driving car lot people person would recognize sidewalk minding business would car get close accidentally stop threat think one fear alleviated also deal breaker mean someone agrees safe get driverless care happy driverless car actually drive there really good chance wont opt might find obnoxious choose drive dont know basically tldr im open convinced driverless car im going need way way information assuranceproof bettersafer experience video like help im little convinced still long way go
tell tf pedestrian supposed cross
would trust uber driver jacked red bull day week
really want driverless minibus mountainscountry side norway trafic trafic light straight road problem enough driver taking older gen done driver license mountainscountry side huge problem
thinking uber driver
dont want car road street moyai
cant wait future cant come soon enough
ai driving car anti human anti god
youre heretic god gave wonderful leg traverse world instead grow choose instead let satan metal devil cage instead whether youre control heresy
veritasium driverless car future petrolheads worldwide visible angry noise
get one cosmic ray boy flippin car bit aaand youre screwed
one best thing selfdriving car predictability
there one requirement need open source
yeah driver loose job company like uber lyft make huge profit
wildly irresponsible longform commercial company using pedestrian volunteer open beta software thats supposed theory plow group ton rolling metal
issue bug thing like opposed idea scrutinize new technology point flaw mean show see wont work problem tech like doesnt necessarily need perfect functional efficient need perform better human seems like argument ego unwillingness embrace change
id still like drive race car fueled octane fun pas
still track segmented road area
worth pointing waymos technology work phoenix arizona perfect map city
valid argument waymo sponsorship kind ruined whole thing
really
really liked elevator analogy hope get maybe mix automated car automated public transportation reduce traffic energy use etc
plane autopilot autoland decadeswe still pilot
let see snow ice heavy traffic
fake car would go mmph non stop year get million mile
pushing garbage people dont care people life
call old fashion im terrified percentage also convinced positivity narrative
good inside town
sad oil company never let happen way earth oil gone
elevator plane nothing close car term operating condition
prediction cause issue behind driverless car though right
car see way around camera
best part self drive car need traffic light anymore
first video understood totally
potential raw stats add impact video missed still awesome video loved seeing everything though wrote paper july titled society understanding impactbenefits autonomous vehicle fatality per million vehicle mile traveled human translates people per day people per year wrote paper total fatality autonomous vehicle usa tesla uber billion autonomous mile driven make fatality per mile driven death per mile driven human death year autonomous driving death total pick one think safer ill hard pressed give driving well love stats dont lie even people dont believe information public united state department transportation
yeah regular road autonomous driving already better average driver certainly
next video want microchip implanted hand
next comment william talbot next video moon landing real
malevolent people eg sound siren hold picture cyclist etc
oddity system still contend work solution isnt commercial availability yet
rpg called shadowrun autonomous driving car law set require grid system control car certain area suspect fully autonomous driver network game set
yeah havent done research topic
rate going megacorporations law unto well
welcome johnny cab please state destination
one important question always ask topic handle software bug complex system software bug leading unforseen accident road who responsible case software engineer made mistake since put software court waymo handle avoid bug
thats test thing lot billion mile simulation video filmed document irregular occurrence person kind experience ever theyre already better average driver road
apocalypseap missing point bug glitch flaw coding independent well train ai
thats definitely major issue selfdriving car bug inevitably happen who responsible who gon na pay injury death important question im personally skeptical le accident selfdriving car might perform better certain situation inevitably make horrible mistake human wouldnt
commute hour way stopandgo traffic college every day start working please engineer lawmaker make happen asap mental health
wish could get sponsored tesla talk fsd beta clunky radar stuck top model
havent see video fsd trying hit pedestrian
steve mann goddamn name
way drove old highschool wish knew town
one potential danger didnt mention someone hack system example make car crash
would interested video compare contrast different training paradigm used waymo tesla ive following ai driver tesla fsd beta feel like ive gained much insight tesla fsd think ive gained waymo feel like tesla training approach make fsd closer breakthrough
waymos selfdriving waymo advanced tesla though
im convinced autonomous driving awersome reducing pollution trafics accident man pleasure drive lack lot
college kid year wont know designated driver
fully autonomous road would make million time safer reduce traffic need street light however getting closer end world
autism epidemic destroying brain least boy soon dont want cant steer ton steel capacity reason pushing nonsense anyone sense would let ai steer around since hacked merely programmed government assassination tool cant put frosting weapon tell people eat
ah yes guy think there going major spike autism diagnosis vaccine also coincidentally programming expert selfdriving car thank god there intelligent patriot like defend u tyranny using ginormous pea brain
hacker lol gta time
sweety hotgirl vlogs people hacking computer powered car killing people
thing happened air france eventually happen malfunction auto pilot disengaged due ice build one sensor computer didnt know plane safety measure computer went default disengaged auto pilot pilot didnt know since relying system could said self driving car everything break point year relying car everything break ready jump back road developing zero skill
olivia crosswalk
nope watched video cosmic ray flip bit car game
agree perspective overall video would appeared objective mentioned boeing max crash discussion computeraided flight design flaw automated system occur made human
please get ride tesla latest beta
thing im waiting even im year old happens there autonomous vehicle etc road human driver
depends country live developed
mean waymo gave money essentially min ad kinda cool regardless honestly know far along
karen crashed pedestrian claimed racist
isnt regular car fully autonomous
god beatnever never let happen thats part nwo evil channel
guy new world order stooge dirty financed propagandor
remember like ish year ago flight pilot came landed said landing completely autopilot
wait till universal radiation flip bit
next goal self driving truck bus etc
would origin disney pixars car
want car city thanks
hope finished video point would great reduce need parking lot parked car car ownership etc support lol
dont news b hype point almost people company selling promise nothing real asking u fund rediculous supposed million tesla taxi million personal self driving vwhicles arent even close nodriver vehicle ran special area area everything mapped line perfect possible sign exactly place computer need team people behind single ride still problem weather unpredicted situation feel like commercial dont want put half ready tech onto road ceo make money would bet anything wish wont common tech another yr minimum
know end personal driving right also challenge take driverless car india
uhhh im sure always able buy car want using robo car soooo much cheaper easier
driverless car make traffic better future people using see huge benefit selling point definitely priority making safe possible imagine driverless car future work together high traffic area properly worked algorithm keep traffic flowing smoothly least better human cant know whats going car immediately next u
ok derek considering recent video concerned bit flip death mass
well thats really cool
thats right keep excusing personal responsibility keep feeding instant gratification outcome inability sit still maintain focus relevant amount time complete computer thinking sound perfect democrat party platform
stay away computer part democrat agenda sent using computer
man trust life auto drive single event upset doomed
thats protection occurrence like ecc memory
well question trust life computer go ahead
whenever im asked long take technology reach point x think there science engineering tech complex social phenomenon evolves fickle landscape market legal political cultural force seeing small fleet driving road tight restriction surprising seeing parking lot torn replaced greenspace working hour increasing per week expensive manual driving permit
wait listing parking lot torn replaced greenspace bad thing
unii didnt listing big change
eaglepicking put surprising change along overworking restriction drive
unii named thing negative make assume list negative thing surely youre concluding statistically low number data point right list possible major change
eaglepicking dont know arguing maybe word torn skewed negative side fact sentence along quite ridiculous idea working extra day per week delivering driving license wealthy people made think thought one ridiculous american people car dont see problem tehy bring along assumed held similar view asked make sure maybe could said might wrong appear think getting rid parking lot bad thing thats case could explain think thing sue please
regardless much autonomous driving make sense wont take without substantial redesign infrastructure transittraffic safety law like happened elevator operator strike new york interesting perhaps prolonged period mixing driverless traditional vehicle road adoption vary country different city rural urban divide u
problem everyone self driving car arent really safer
need autonomous car people cant drive
derek people average driving anything else hardly surprising mean skewed distribution know people could completely accurate belief also problem question interpreted differently different people
maybe youre right think bias often notice bad driver good driver dont cause probems behave expected way someone ask youre better driver people recall bad driver say yes
unii actually agree definitely also effect well think derek refers simply tend overestimate ability effect swamped simple truth ability behave skewed distribution meaning much effect left explained also said parent comment real issue whether trust survey data begin people answer question stated imagine average refer median answer im better average think im pretty good havent recent major accident answer affirmative system style dont know havent checked study either sorry without knowing thing statistic le meaningless
autonomous car might become safe might illegal manual drive car
im still waiting lidar stock take lol

im curious know deployment technology centred around ownership vehicle simply another form ehailing service case ownership tech add ons required would purchase price one vehicle im guessing far much average consumer even consider
k fully autonomous vehicle thats economy car thats another reason technology wont fully take anytime soon
usual clown pushing expensive toy rich obviously end lot people job let pretend vehicle wont expensive like electric car rich able afford thats point isnt

tesla isnt autonomous vehicle waymo shhhh
standing theremenacingly
well driverless car better careless driver
main fear self driving car communicating might hacked even cant smart enough car engineer hack criminal something
wow great presentation ive one flight landed fog thick couldnt see runway looking window also like comparison elevator needing driver time know real circumstance driverless car almost never fault except maybe one brand truly isnt supposed driverless judging careless driver ive experienced freeway im fairly sure id rather passenger automated car
always thought moral dilemma pretty stupid human think morality situation human ai would try avoid accident altogether enough control make moral choice probably also still enough control prevent accident
joke dont id much rather vehicle control
autonomous car ideal solution everyone around autonomous vehicle driving everyone around unpredictable one following rule road bad dont lane hard think autonomy would ideal come india im talking bad driving condition im talking real bad
india never autonomous vehicle within present traffic law itll changed would think
therealuncleowen yeah rule one really follows get itll take long long long time
investing crypto cool especially current rise market
yes right
thanks introducing mr allen
people scared investing high rate scam business
making remain poor ignorance
scammer real broker waiting investor
well autonomous car would always lack consciousness
imagine future without driverscan imagine one without car
question bring real progress
honestly im id rather driver seat tell something go wrong correct much like airline pilot
lol robo car vision reaction time much better human would never able change outcome real wreck happened bc car unavoidably crashing waymo
love content could please maybe get better camera stabilizator getting dizzy watching handheld motion frequently lol
month ago coming home graveyard shift extremely tired close home like im talking two minute blink eye im launching really steep ditch bank cause fallen asleep thankful went right side road instead crossing traffic injuring people autonomous car cant fall asleep cant wait autonomous vehicle
lot benefit selfdriven car predicated assumption people willing forgo car instead use fleet autonomous selfdriving car long car give people freedom convenience owning car might issue there also fact driving car feel good cultural experience many may want give autonomous car mandated name public safety also lost job
already add green space city dont suggest disingenuously ai car somehow create park didnt need parking lot wed house business since land us human choose
would perfect solution want spend rest life sitting patiently traffic driving speed limit waiting patiently large gap crosstraffic leaving twocar space vehicle sound like good idea could literally double commute time
crash due human error driver human driver ai ai responsible crash
insane something
fair early elevator passenger door scary part potential fall early elevator double scissor door looked like would grab sleeve drag death
driver loose thier livelyhoods automation learn code
difference plane car plane landing glowing stationary completely empty space specifically land car deal extremely sudden unpredictable situation large variety unknowable reality
wish could car autopilot imagine quickly could go place small electric car going everywhere need accident
like electric fan came servents using hand fan lost job
im glad pointed obvious issue human cause death people car many cyclist die negligent driver many couldve avoided ridiculous driver prefer drive stay away car kind bakas
like describe computer driving car confident lol yeah mathematical certainty doesnt lead much second guessing
maybe skynet switching subtle tactic
think important note autonomous car created equal tesla data demonstrates autonomous driving still technical limitation likely fail
certain car insurance company pushing happen anytime soon prefer multibillion dollar revenue improved safety le death road sad
traffic autonomous safer wont even traffic light anymore take le time go anywhere wonder ride price pleasure driving
ok long forced compliance autonomous driving time sometimes go ride destress dont specific location woudnt want program vehicle specific destination make judgement call intersection sometimes learned many new place visit restaurant shop etc cruising around year wouldnt want option completely eliminated driving year never accident couldnt imagine living world option taken away know damn well autonomous vehicle every movement tracked data sold company looking market
hacked right
thing self driving card dont need perfect need better human lot easier
cool thing already pretty much perfect literally crash waymos fault
non human driver made electronic smart safe enough yet maybe far future like several century later
car succeeds indian road believe
video showing flawed human lol
people already dont trust people driving surely doubt people first meet ride car pas whatever mental test there human flaw like forgetting turn making bad decision try rectify mistake people getting emotional people cutting wanting tail gate simply driving fast theyre bad time management fact there road rage duis proof ai given shot
could create robust public transportation system drastically reduce car death le money
big reason likely still year away legislation insurance fault decision etc get messy enough itd problematic tech likely better performing people legal issue cause issue next year
always fight preserve autonomy either charge somebody else classic give u self determination safer giving life soulless bureaucrat anything safe life longer make decision life captivity potential abuse give freedom endless endless shenanigan maker smart phone assorted operating service ready hand rest life good luck
thats dont wear shoe bureaucrat cant take away freedom step toe broken glass sidewalk get grip
really like become thing soon hate commuting hate much im working home order delivery hmm
well google google im wondering much kind data google collect passenger environment could collect become main stream
see many comment regarding road condition like snow etc dont already system car prevent u skidding oversteering situation wheel giving different torque breaking independently work many people dont even realise happens unpredictable input driver think get trained given surface car reaction time judgement time quicker accurate human possibly could drive car without electronic system snow compare modern one gizmo becomes much safer computer take replace slow thinking lump squashy blob equation think weather wont problem soon work though car autonomous sadly love drive
wait car sits driveway depreciating every hour need repair fuel oil professional racing driver see every single error road cant get soon enough strangely industry going suffer coming future organ donor industry million year get replaced
organ farm
program may sacrifice driver order save pedestrian think
im looking forward day autonomous driving capacity allows u really rethink transport personal office pod attached house move attach company office day head highway click together pod take another city meeting simply keep working desk per normal day im looking forward pizza delivery vehicle cm tall offroad wheel duck around vehicle zipping house step deliver pizza zip im looking forward order anything size shop appropriate shaped sized vehicle redirected go pick deliver within minute instead day week online shopping often none seems much expect near future right
question asked office drive work need company office cuz sound dystopian af
disliked video due use extremely unlikely hypothetical scenario youre sending wrong message
cool nah like driving
still allowed drive le traffic fewer dumb driver getting way robo car road
oh miss soo someone many point driving empty road real life try freeway rush hour see anticipate people long act largely watch driver oh elevator comparison absurd thing ever said clip airplane half step plane still auto land crash example let u talk many crash occurred due computer failure auto mode ok empty road fine car till disaster put bottom dollar reality frequently prevented disaster driver operated vehicle pay attention due second guessing like absolutely long way get safely
may fuctional though would say still year away lot technology functional widely adopted scarse due resource
think thats true waymo think tesla le year away maybe
future driverless car future also temporarily banned google car watching video online doesnt align political view
nonsense see like driving ive also never serious accident bugger
baloney dont understand allowed people want either selling hoping stop paying driver automatic braking avoid hitting something someone good idea automatic driving accident responsible
must admit skeptical imagine fun driving car thing absorbs car even listen radio see plus would like put driver vehicle question type car would cope polish road generally outside u outlet allotment garden dirt road interesting strange place without marking place
know driving car stop fun
bottom line automated attentive possible automated driving could useful case deadly case never perfect matter sudden move different driver le likely countered sudden stop machine driving according rule road safety always improvise quickly
point gone eradicate driver completely
real question refuel
gasoline
would lane highway autonomous vehicle could communicate eachother would able car go super fast super save imagine line car going kmh without car crash autonomous car electric could perhaps make car charge part road dont know much physic
really really cool want drive personally even risk one day might make human error
term promotion tesla doesnt exist
put indian road leave rest imagination
ok order car want one
cosmic ray hit car learned cosmic ray one video
yeah let go autonomous let find solution athe billion driver shall
hoping self driving year ago child old enough drive would didnt work hopefully soon
self driving car awesome excellent wish could one soon
functional lol still decade away
also asked question whether thought average driver way ask question super misleading word word asked class think least average driving answer yes think average last checked least class raised hand guy asking went possible average driver asked least average completely skews question question better average would risen hand
mean also possible average either
sephirothrr depends average
ugh autopilot fly plane myth autolands higher workload manual landing autolands landing plus autolands autoland calm wind crosswind limitation plus wind cause fog blow away mean pilot dont use perform autoland
know theyre competition wouldnt make sense waymo tesla uber mercedes audi company selfdriving car buy small disused town somewhere pay people live every car road driverless people could visit town signing waiver say cant sue driverless car hit driven around car people would get used company would get valuable data pr provided nothing went wrong make sure nothing go wrong
great video agree point however one issue need discussed fact large part economy comprised driver taxi ride sharing truck bus delivery vehicle happen ai phase job sector economy well discussion need keep making great video
yeah keep telling people car programmed run poc safe
video feel like promotion waymo noted sponsored waymo video doesnt answer number question selfdriving car testing arizona different testing state snow rain remain question image recognition self driving car thin layer snow misinterpreted car
yeah feel like went pro many con
neural net learning paramount believe tesla closest real self driving vehicle type vehicle rely hd mapping cant handle change
lazerusmfh number fatality tesla selfdriving feature expect classaction lawsuit think camera alone sufficient selfdriving car think something like lidar laser radar required effective autonomous vehicle neural network powerful mimic human visual system however problem trained neural network problem solution retraining debugged since exists set weight synapsis would guess something like prestructured neural network may used would constructed instead trained
iankaplan human driver sometimes retrained
iankaplan prestructured neural net trying describe transformer probably successful version pretrained extension nns chained together least far know regarding debugging totally agree complexity troubleshooting similar trying understand information human used make decision said tool like attention extract information happening layer change meaningful way uhh really still retrain nn hopefully youve gotten useful information redesign size pooling convolution skip connection etc correct input data adjust bias may affecting training
sign bad dont live phoenix san francisco
issue much technology human road user cutting well toying automated vehicle ofc feel need manual ride case also would autonomous vehicle tailgated add issue like pedestrian front car requiring evasive action still tailgated short dont trust human idiot time take transition mass adoption
great video love sure autonomous car one big network would help safety system would know sure car
safety always goal strive
lmfaooo smh moment
robber need stand road potential victim car stop riding debris stop detects small piece plastic road also weather condition like snow may tricky especially hard car break time love progress still see issue
hi great video one suggestion trying avoid seeing video situation people die please show scene without prior notice case tesla car driving truck tragic scene shocking want protect seeing kind stuff thanks understanding
ye country like people dont follow traffic rule like politician child cant work road rage may heard
car california laser jammer installed anytime face automated car jammer blind depending laser figure way might dangerous please also mention aspect
idea car might snow ice
million people globally usa hundred year extremely low number compare great influenza people died globallyfrom complication flu one year million percent billion x b come population extremely low thats th yes people extremely safe driver think way many people know least talking occasionally term killed car crash exactly point know one person im going ever happens massive scale youre taking away massive amount person freedomliterally think garbage google pulled last year want tracking every move already track internet permanently stored never go away know
release universe hostile computer
love use tesla accident example sponsored waymo
work tram track
think wonderful technology wonder given one video covering cosmic interference computer whether switch could made disrupt pilot
want think reason would avoid like plague one thing hit road sue arse
cutest car ever made bro thing hideous tf mean lol technology awesome body hot
im technology however there preventable death oklahoma massive accident caused automated car freeway slamming break got close bridge go got rear ended semi truck behind bunch people died apparently type reflective paint bridge confused computer see bridge wall path look mathematically would still better reducing overall death youre good driver like who never accident year driving class license drive everything well would never automated car bridge think people safer option im going wait untill story stop kink ironed trust life computer road trying make sense illogical human road plus love driving love driving semi truck love driving personal vehicle even computer one day drive better professional driver doesnt mean ill want give task computer one day future robot able please husband wife better yall want give task havent even got hacker might able every vehicle road fully automated think different thing could happen
dont want car road get train bus instead
live snowy area dont see driverless car coming anytime soon
problem technology integration human driver either need vehicle autonomous need human good driver following rule im sure
cosmic ray video dont know believe
tesla thing camera
hacked data collection system vulnerability system allow proper functioning vehicle cant hack eye reflex
self driving car self landing plane cool cant wait see continously improved
collision car swap number
usa country earth thats never heard public transport
selfdriving car cool still want able drive v year listen pop crackle please dont take away biggest passion life
get ready pay nose insurance
personally ive always supported automated car seems like natural progression term advancement
dont trust autopilot want control crush gas pedal
luckily youll still allowed car drive people choose use robo car bc cheaper easier
attention people watch universe hostile computer trusting driverless car one bit change increase speed kmh kmh
there emergency stop button
sound elitist people suck driving easiest indicator person driving skill shown react heavy freeway traffic whether stop go try find average speed traffic coming someone class b professional license special certificate drive ft long school bus
good video young man im critical thank
watching minimum wage worker getting crushed enough say fam give enough keep home ghetto aware u please god
never driverless car world may ask ever heard elevator race lol
want pull imitate siren sound btw ever go ghetto block itll get dismantled like really quick
adding way many point failure trusted human life
could potentially jeopardize fast furious series
never suffered delusion would reliable driver automated system one cant wait driverless vehicle norm accident due human error two due people error driving usually risky thing person life
fact
wont need driver wonder im gon na find job starve universal income kick starve
totally disagree statement maybe year ago everyone know computer think person every time said antilock brake kidborn one want computer control braking big pushback younger people might understand true antilock brake pretty much standard id say people would want ina daily driverobv stunt car sport car classic perhaps wouldnt even buy car didnt feel people believe statement self driving car would absolutely safer get bug soon car auto driving least hybrid auto system talk car around hard braking event ahead car notified self stop emergency soon accident caused people
surprisingly enough havent heard much google fully autonomous car since recently big company develop implement system well thought would safe car driven ai would data car currently road mark destination go
everything getting automated future war also fought robot seems like cool game play im imagining planet moon allows robot war fun
corrupt enforcer know self driving car recorded attempt scamming driver mr jones corrupt enforcer howd know name self driving car lidar
thing bother manufacture freezing car car moving forgot pay monthly fee
car one front car equivalent come parent arent home
lady sound dutch
give year till feel normal ride driverless car
even close autonomy everything tesla mile away waymo crap gm ford crap tesla billion mile ahead competition mean youre many time likely die crappy brand autonomous car
least theyre trying better hope
wont
autopilot bus henan zhengzhou china back believe without steering wheel accelerator
good grief finding someone doesnt need subtitle disappointed thats best waymo put front camera couldnt understand word said technology impressive
public transportation carry every positive argument made video unreasonably efficient environmentally realistic greater population cheaper
public transportation
nullvoid definition public transport
alexj right im sure exactly thinking moment maybe thinking could used public transport would like keep ability operate repair vehicle im thinking something like commaai self driving kit sourcing customer driving data publicly provide open platform self driving vehicle putting together government maintain file server publicly donated data self driving vehicle create licensing standard similar inspection system car would test hardware implementation self driving vehicle ensure meet standard open door nearly endless choice car manufacturer complete customization parodying existing culture car customization
nullvoid dont think people advocate public transport av want private transport banned way thing right unsustainable car trip could made walkingbikingpublic transport
public transportation big flaw pandemic unsanitary condition public transport unless fix train subway litter crap problem never see wide spread adoption public transport
hate car car stop parked city change attitude shared car mean le parked car would great
daxandaxter ruin city people dont need
say unlikely also us constant aeroplane always crashing first disliked video many straw man argument
damn technology though
people good driver ahhaahahahahahahha
hate cuboid
car road replaced selfdriving car could get rid speed limit road sign red light etc average person spends half year life stop light imagine could time
build train lite rail
im looking forward welcome time ai taken driving human cant drive vehicle there steering wheel pedal car finally get psychopath dangerous bully drunk visually impaired texters caffeinated distracted driver road dangerous tailgater cutting people road rage control freak psychopath dangerous bully hate ai driving control freak get kick tailgating cutting people initiating road rage
human self driving car dangerous also human walk parked car
time ever got accident parked car fault even kidding
moving towards dense walkable smart city practical option opinion using efficient mode public transportation away failed car centric suburban experiment
trouble already infrastructure unfortunately would cost massive amount time money resource rebuildrestructure present sesque suburban infrastructure however agree going forward smart city way plan design city
indeed selfdriving car seem like remedy car infested abomination infrastructure currently though absolutely believe kind technology would help public transportation longer distance transportation
car say youre getting pulled legality associated duo check point snow extreme storm robust adaptable really
want autonomous car bad would travel visit people much didnt deal driving like driving feel like fun actual trip stressful place whateveri hate feel like im always mad driver going line using blinker ignoring stop signsgod people bad driving consider super careful still miss thing close call luckily ive never real wreck even stopped cop always stress
im curious road work situation makeshift lane traffic cone obey human traffic director autonomous car understand hand motion human traffic director
take wouldnt even use human traffic director send information situation directly car put sort broadcasting device along parameter work call day
google map already tell road closure ahead possible detour around
view see ppl walking decide go yes able understand hand signal soon
yeah tesla line marked future ai learned lot able drive anywhere everywhere regardless line unlike waymo lidar
clearly issue road work etc chandler arizona
guess ill miss feeling driving becomes obselete
im beginning video already thought terrifying allow human drive switch completely driverless soon possible
pilot land way better computer mastered point barely notice landed aside deceleration
elevator driver
there need invent selfdriving regain green space get rid parking lot civilizd country already achieved simply investing public transport particular urban railway metro tramway etc north america still trying battle congestion using wrong tool traffic never contained car road autonomous way actually achieve build train look tokyo singapore amsterdam munich dont discussion solved car traffic problem back
couldnt agree talk making city easier navigate blind disabled breath discus making intersection without stoplight faster travel want u call uber cross street building public transportation walkable space way solve problem selfdriving car bandaid best detriment worst
cheesewiz ruin experience driving car car essentially luxury toy people want convenience willing pay treating like workhorse default driving car fun hobbyist experience niche specialist application workforce ie delivery driver uber driver etc joy car human operation removing creates inconvenient inefficient considerably dangerous train tram lite rail selfdriving car authoritarian inefficient stupid missing point
thebananamonger often using public transport spending good time walking destination
rafradeki ok thats benefit lmao
could bad waymo stop bad guy want hijacked car
reason im fully self driving vehicle fact carguy love driving behind wheel passenger time see pro far havent seen anyone think people enjoy driving
im curious see would perform cold environment w snow im sure soon
theyve tested condition typically dont perform well lidar get confused heavy snow ice accumulation also effect sensor there reason testing thing southwest
great give everyone reason keep eye need phone
arent tesla level still require driver
yeah ive wanted driverless car norm year even back data showed safe safer human technology improved sooner get driverless car road norm better
cool train better
last minute video like think technology already question worth asking go next replace manual vehicle self driving vehicle technology longer need adapt bad human driver simply communicate vehicle around thing wouldnt possible right could open interstate travel speed literally fast car handle speed limit exceeding speed would inherently dangerous exist entirely human cant trusted exceed limit could remove directional traffic lane open lane omnidirectional movement car would know safe far left side road get way vehicle hiveminded gps would literally know traffic coming mile minute ahead able make sort physical contact stop light traffic circle would become practically unnecessary unless proved efficient autodriving car honestly society could pretty much abandon vehicular ownership altogether schedule vehicle wherever want part national rideshare initiative sure people would opt buy autonomous vehicle one treat car like storage unit bad habit would optional luxury requirement living im trying picture perfect utopian society dont see one still drive vehicle human dont perfection skill machine
love driving never check phone dont drink drug much hate seeing new driverless car coming think best solution everyone much safer efficient future
bro imagine much time robot took traffic always like jakarta
universe hostile computer hope transistor doesnt flip car turn left instead right
use two chip compare decision made like airplane two enough use three four performance better
become normal become affordable
huge fear driving many accident death caused human error start shaking thought getting car feel like chance dying getting seriously injured incredibly high cant wait selfdriving vehicle norm
literally thought think entering normal car
cosmic ray particle hit cpu car changing byte data
bet get common place accident two seem like human wouldnt make itll interesting see rational people happen since saving lot life
nooo houston hopeful move area see like
people cant even trust vaccine expect people trust
mean great safe isnt public transportation better car self driving car almost aspect understand america transport designed around car train subway tram etc safer efficientcarry people better environment reduces traffic think self driving car interesting prospect think car general outclassed public transportation general obviously american citizen take train government hasnt built investing better public transit seems like better idea
im firm believer thjat autonomous vehicle road equates le accident speak one another human plainly suck attentive
exposed one fault technology without realizing normal person would issue coming conclusion person wasnt going cross front vehicle autonomous vehicle meanwhile took emergency stop situation incapable picking important human cue like making eye contact acknowledging meaning behind cue
id rather emergency stop running someone plus person walking clear intent id going lot slower way person walking would never
human still land plane good weather dont forget land period never like learned skill lose ability human never landed plane anymore let computer work think would happen computer malfunction
get point something pricise plane flight computer ai aint ready yet future probably better human
drsyedmuhammadmanazerul flying easier driving ai ready passenger
michaeldarlingco thats meant ai isnt yet good enough convince passenger
talk shooting foot lmao best way entire field work disappear precarious line work begin go strike
love idea driverless car would absolutely love one concern hacker even current vehicle sophisticated computer remotely hacked forced turn worse speed driverless car hacker could conceivably create crash always arm race failsafes firewall illintentioned hacker
imagine driverless car still behind wheel take action something go wrong youre paying attention time
behind wheel doesnt really solve problem hacker completely shut engine highway already hacker able control jeep transmission year ago car gotten electronically wired since im saying driverless car bad idea frickin want one want maker programmer driverless car certain absolutely positive car safe malicious outside influence bring comment kinda find suspicious wasnt even touched video
silverletomi hacker crash car regardless self driving nothing really change
also almost got run speeding car red light big truck really want atoumation
way would suck
want driverless car road want le car road
driverless car completely eliminate traffic jam
car better professional truck driver
mainly convenience woohoo technology need data long term
nobody realize car decide get go want go minimum simply turning directed gogo zone end isnt making life perfectly safe able choose go guy paid google know would never limit option way essentially propaganda
well see sir elevator stopped bicycle ran programmed thousand human lifetime worth experience please try careful around elevator hurt
situational awareness car isnt hangup dumbass ai driver gta better driver human still computer bound lock freeze eventually
yeah chance far lower chance getting distracted making mistake thats whats bizarre worry computer messing course human mess far often
think selfdriving car totally sensible must made mandatory road main concern cost affordability western country prevalent autonomous vehicle decade developing country
think confirms thought year fsd car affordable like k max ban sale car driver ban use car driver like year would unfair bad environment make brand new car obselete
shes reallife seo dalmi kdrama start
autonomous vehicle rarity road happens majority dozen vehicle within yard every one sending lidar radar signal interfere operating multiple radio transmitter tower carefully studied ensure interference hundred unknown vehicle coming within yard sort who even problem internet million data packet running piece fiber
veritasium love video want driverless car year ago claim people believe average driver doesnt surprise park city ut commuter see average skill mountain driving ice snow low visibility la driver see superior ability negotiate heavy traffic respective level competence comfort type driving routinely higher average driver even change question safety youre still stuck definition problem safety measured raw number accident regardless severity insurance claim dollar decent measure happen data death death le difficult remember measure many would assume like average driver kill people respondent killed people might say average rest may accident near miss people could killed might say average assumption example could giving totally rational answer vague question p air force pilot say dollar every inflight autothrottleautopilot problem uncommanded climb descent disconnect unreliable navigation signal etc could sponsor next video youre lucky enough airfield aircraft cat iii autoland meet condition use still good pilot situation case something unexpected happen also see stop sign pedestrian meter away assume many confess dont know
thank input autopilot tech plane around decade still require pilot one main point make people push driverless vehiclesand plane dont nearly many obstacle landing take flight pedestrian k foot lol
term average thing thats pretty much universally case matter ask people people think average intelligence even though cant possibly mathematically true people think average whatever ask common ego overrating selfconfidence pushed little bit far etc
great point also would hopefully decrease drunk driving accident downside skynet take leading arnold schwarzenegger type cyborg
dont want driverless car want fewer car
disabled simply existing due would much prefer type vehicle perhaps something like would actually benefit something resembles life
think driving car key life youre doomed already
simonestreeter yes already disabled extremely get help get thing done get place need perhaps day youll get experience werent aware statistically men become disabled manner reach age
baby born today wont need driver license turn
would affordable majority long
self driving car still year away good enough navigate rural road europe cant
ad
great video derek future sure exciting
cosmic particle happen
point driver license useless
im pretty sure driverless car reducing traffic nonsense travelling car becomes seamless le dangerous relaxing people going ride car there going traffic street going made smaller there going green space driverless car there going space city space per person decreased cant happen everyone riding car gon na happen either smaller vehicle bicycle especially public transport im driverless car particular argument doesnt seem right
think could contribute reducing traffic encourages people rideshare software good mapping shared route people majority car road driverless share kind communication capability coordinate behavior maximal traffic flow point seen study mileslong traffic jam caused cumulative human behavior overreacting stopped car side road etc coordinated driverless car wouldnt issue example
get driverless car near human included dangerous road
fear bootleg version might appear possibly putting trusting people danger new type tech get big well put together brand looking good profit usually follow sadly also high school whenever tried talk subject always ridiculed thought instantly rejected man much better machine course seeing video made smile quite bit actually im excited get license probably wont need im dutch im mainly riding bicycle anyway
im curious would adapt according weather snow condition game changer road
waymo car adapt anything unknown reason allowed destinct area
work different autonomous vehicle company deliberately run train weather condition including one weve seen simulation make lot easier testing given uk get pretty random weather begin
driver cant drive snow
rycochet generally believe autonomous would ok condition ive wondering point fully autonomous car give stop like year driving there weatherroad condition id judged either impossible dangerous keep driving namely torrential rain wiper help nothing whiteout rural area reference road snow fine there particular type slush simultaneously start hydroplaning steering road thats devious especially multilane motorway fellow motorist often display apparent overconfidence studded tire keep traction first two alternative ive stopped middle road lucky traffic gave bad enough slush slowed residential speed motorway wondering automation would camera occluded time potentially icy condition there steep hill slide ice stop drivable surface attempt
snook fair selfdriving car wouldnt overconfident ability drive situation way human would
lol poor elevator driver dont like way treated going strike year later job doesnt even exist
happen cab truck driver
trust autonomous car hilly track
rebuild better stronger smarter robo cab coming soon city near
manurr lol get real
manurr job evolve maintenance doesnt remove job change nature want someone vehicle time anyway incase actually kind job would probably pay even driving
pretty skin genotypically melt tuna substantively spot fabulous refrigerator laughable snotty maid
want driverless car
problem self driving car provided dont pay pay machine would decide even hazardous stupid andor ilegal called free people
motorcyclist one easy brake swerve increase stopping distance increase speed hit motor cyclist choosen hit thats even trolley problem
thats always reverse park much dangerous reversing back amount time ive tried leave car park polite staying space see another car leaving taking forever theyre reversing
yup always back option
coachrambo yeah sometimes theyre side road angle would need way clear degree turn reversing youre degree facing traffic head though would bad wanted go opposite direction came last time drove past row marked space thought
cool
wow half video im looking part video address technology put hundred thousand work next decade keep hearing politics divisive technology gave everyone smart phone social medium tiny part issue last year million lost good paying job automation one explained overcome people believe job went overseas immigrant came stole fact replaced technological improvement automation site sixty million died auto accident last century mention child word nephew drive ltl route california feed yearold daughter job eliminated neighbor drive ups pull kid college wait union address issue pending irrelevance since youre scientist im guessing seen map graphic show area country devastated manufacturing job loss overlaid opioid overdoses spike violent crime rate increase suicide sure mean well let pull back forcing dangerous technology throat concentrate recover technology guy graciously bestowed world past decade thanks listening
concern since car wont able drive itneed anymore illegal maybe gasoline rare dont like idea handing transportation freedom company yet another thing im signing away rich people everything already like idea dont get wrong get feeling going one thing like public school free educationbut education want give want learn
take human trust issue
im sure like idea one factor cosmic radiation corrupt data another factor possibility bad coding third factor odd stuff happen programmer havent accounted
situation combined still cause le death average driver
people stand front stop rob worse yeah occupant new crime develope
thinking amount else statement code
replacing human involvement life machine labor instead augmenting biggest mistake lifetime rate sure easier short term
wat bit switch car
cant wait sit back seat commuting work evet heard public transportation
imagine getting kidnapped driverless car
ai get kidnapped ummmyall hear something
dont trust issue automation trust issue people
biggest issue adoption driverless car public mistrust like elevator medium take one single incident million mile driven make seem like common thing could happen moment see time tesla love grab headline like tesla vehicle involved crash autopilot engaged half time investigating find driver completely fault yet never make article really happened information collected dont even bother edit take original one false there honor reporting anymore one care truth want eye catching headline get click
sophisticated permission untypically file chimpanzee acly nod juvenile butane delicate understood chef
prefer control live rural area
need technology like yesterday
oh boy dont know handle youtuber video reference im already subscribed year already watched giggle jeez derek youre giving heart palpitation
ill bet driverless vehicle smart enough move passing lane
wont passing anybody wont allowed
would trust autonomous car open source blockchain car company cyber security laughable
ohhh thats google keep asking click car bus traffic light
public transportation way
hello really enjoy video make video car spends gasoline energy window ac
car run gas quicker window myth buster thing year ago
pay self driving car fuck
actually almost certainly reduce traffic increased convenience result trip taken reason adding lane highway doesnt reduce congestion problem wasnt lack coordination inherent inefficiency automobility car take space transport le people form transportation self driving car wont fix theyll let watch movie instead driving traffic
anyone see ufo fly car
fly guy
review tesla fsd
also consider elderly would safer driverless car
hopefully car manufactured protected cosmic ray
johnny cab missed opportunity
honestly really wished autonomous driving would already become commonplace really like driving
really like idea say yr mean lot u dont live say california need see new england small road pothole detour prove tech wrong really test work pressure otherwise limit go vehicle handle icy road etc im reality lot u
wow never im passionately favor great video mah dude
dude feel like good minute gooooooood information
maybe silly question car pottencially hacked
every car drverless ground traffic elminated much safer x efficient react therefore move much faster
primary issue driverless car order make truely safe someday car driver need banned willing give freedom second computer engineer computer hardware flawless third rare software bug free software complex bug also become complex business model behind vehicle must econmical somewhere business decision made consequence business decision yet experienced far airplane improperly repiared rear pressure vessel blew took tail pilot figure fly airplane using thrust oops pilotless airplane guess going die hey still
play siren iphone car stop know sound real ambulance fake sound coming someone phone even music video
long ignore condition people drive ie bad road bad weather erratic driver etc selfdriving car work great weird always seem see palm tree wherever selfdriving car praised whole lot evergreen
tech company highly educated staff get choose live work
autonomous car sound nice useful people un able drive complication wouldnt take autonomous vehicle personal enjoy wheel able drive peaceful relaxing control
think far future wont much choice therell private track etc keep need satisfied
fact tesla keep hitting emergency vehicle
get cab would prefer automotous vehicle take underground every time
whats noise standing next car
veritasium please make video tesla autopilot would love see similar report beta full driving comparison
dont really want drive stuff
problem autonomous vehicle acidente happens responsoblity
ai car human car data ever help determine fault easy enough ai ai company work within company company really passenger problem
orbbb normaly kill person car somoene arrested ai
flaviosnow obviously law would place solve situation someone would still help responsible liability wouldnt go anywhere company would liable
people average driver type average youre talking mean requires distribution small number really horrible driver pulling average making people average
good lidar radar need geofenced
human like control driverless car provide control le trusted
think thing would make feel better whe driver seat steering wheel etc seat facing eachother
ill eat short ai drive big city ai going know light traffic cop nodding people talking cell phone get ai powerful youve got much selfdriving car
car ai driven wouldnt need traffic cop nodding people car could communicate network move accordingly
orbbb important part said im even le convinced human driver removed road ai drive car environment designed ai thats talking
love video dont understand self driving car reduce parking lot im sure lot people going want car take taxi like service car need park refuel charge
here think many accident think caused thing like someone hit biker thought biker wasnt turning near identical circumstance happening multiple place throughout world vast majority human making mistake somewhere never repeat mistake especially something big even turn right red shouldnt dont cause accident jsut almost theyll learn theoretically self driving car make mistake one car make mistake somewhere every single car learn mistake one car fails detect right red sign somewhere get corrected self driving car ever make mistake like one person learning instead billion person least doesnt ever make mistake twice considering probably every possible mistake made point nearly given company tend mistake best interest car inevitably safer human matter matter many mistake take get
find closing observation advantage self driving car telling get exactly public transportation maybe selfdriving car supersmart workaround lack great public transportation
yes maybe keep old car decide selfdrivers arent going take anywhere want go
simonestreeter dont car choice im extremely lucky live country car isnt strictly necessity thing
stephanebjrn yes wouldnt able fully enjoy usa without one ive lived new york city time ive preferred carfree life
true car generally get place much faster public transit except maybe super high traffic city like nyc
alan except dont get want go backdoor programmed selfdriving car seem missed point
wow wish road area phoenix looked good one video ldw system error frequently sue sign obscured tree overgrowth got ticket go court prove still mistake made time never compensated oopsie
shadoune
big city next five year changing launch sf month later
child born wont take driver license theyre buy av thats think yr top itll everywhere new car least itll take another av
thank wonderful video
listening history elevator make think programmer believe write better assembly code optimizing compiler generates yes able theyre far
honestly crap tier programmer easier thinkif youre good assembly compiler absolutely convert program lot inefficiency left write code assembly almost always better know reasonably confident assembly code almost always better compiler
car stupid tho use train walking bike public transport
one main issue fact technology fail ongoing basis various reason waymo passenger run little girl stepped street reason get blame mr waymo programmerscar software technician distracted pressing stop button really think mr waymo go jail
mean im sure would depend happened would investigation determine cause incident whether brake failure car check place responsible camera failure fault people troubleshooting camera etc etc legal system work fine case like reason put using driverless system furthermore car made assumption driver present fault user pushing big red button
habit making people sound like fool instantly trusting new technology never seen even heard cyclist skate boarder hit running car mere fact mentioned concerning even sudden stop second saw worker trolley come already cause many problem fact company paying money make video telling everyone stupid let say silly polite instantly trusting something way trust elevatorswitch even comparison ever made since word simply go updown look insane positive comment video wonder much might lying u company paid lying great sale man maybe ethical future video especially getting paid make far likely biased never mind love technology witch give bias never mind love science probably systematic
im
technological development life easy simply make u productive aka working
self driving car safer idea giving every control algorithm terrifying
yes worse deathly boring
woman hit parked trying get parking space completely dented bumper told lucky lucky heard able stop damage wasnt impaired thats terrifying
orbbb pity thats take terrify here getting perspective
ego meaningless
simonestreeter read book take nap
automated system describe airplane land airplane extreme weather unless define extreme weather fog
fun game post wrong comment youtube waymo drive cliff
work country like u
make ride home bar date much exciting
would better driverless public transportation driverless car still private car
bruh car safer shitty driver encounter road doesnt even compare
cool
help people newly enter country dont driving license dont know drive
cringe would ok different title
like there driver yet still plexiglas protecting front seat lmao
still adopted anything else known u
mean course work well city barely pedestrian youre city like mine heavy traffic everywhere scooter motorbike running place sht ton pedestrian child wherever go yeah aint gon na work still definition guess qualifies level autonomous vehicle certain situation limit modernized city good infrastructure pedestrian
tesla thing lvl boston self driving texis
look feel cool honest doesnt allow hacker hack software car gain control see phone get hacked normally phone information get hacked doesnt physically damage u hacker hacking car take u anywhere even might kill u making car crash would love know perspective thought cool technology sound look think also important keep mind negative side
wonder vehicle handle heavy rainsnow icy condition
simple fact self driving car dont play phone driving make much safer
cant wait hate driving
ai lover begone said replaced elderly road ragers im pretty ok
guess real ethical dilemma control vehicle like human error terrible agree however accident happens fatal question rise driving rather computer know answer worse even autonomous car get someone killed huge news footage nationwide human error get someone killed hit local news even
would nice mom ran garage forgetting put car reverse
introvert see absolute win
live phoenix see van time
definitely safer tesla still wouldnt want autonomous vehicle ive seen robot
biggest issue driverless car security software there already multiple occasion people tesla hacked brake disabled guarantee form closed circuit system
human cant get used electric vehicle could get used driverless vehicle despite beneficial
road icy would know would correct
safety imagine vehicle connected sharing information parked car hundred meter front warns child hiding two parked car
taxi driver
self driving car future always watching road never tired making best possible decision in microsecond dont speed dont make stupid lane change turn importantly driving predictable self driving car become norm traffic flow much smoother
dont think kind giving headache instinctively distrust driverless car much like instinctively distrust idea machine performing operation rather human surgeon there something human trust even evidence show machine safer cause brain say nah let think dont know cause instinctive distrust hurt try figure
people think average driver
ive convinced selfdriving way go since robot
would cheaper every car screen showing degree camera view top half front degree vision bottom half rear degree would pretty much remove everyones blindspots edit could even colorcode thing based either close quickly travelling toward someone going speed riding bumper would colored orange screen someone travelling straight toward mile per hour faster would colored red someone hundred foot travelling mph faster would green blue screen
probably
amazed today technology invention speed mostly nobody thought year ago kind thing could even possible near future nowonly sad thing live country afraid adoption new inventionslike living germany xd people still think internet something new hahaha

thing computer there le thing equal tough situation dont think entering driver le car simply cause love driving agree human arent supposed drive near point challenge brain time make brain feel ease constant flow lol mentioned video writing delicate line people walk driving funny many realize xd
remember first realized changed way drive rest life unfortunately take ever happens probably age getting driver license haha
simonestreeter optimal way drive think like computer keep checking info get human get used constant info comfortable
im glad least honest logic go idea driver road name safety wonder people start considering world look like every safe decision required
dont need driving licence need learn drive
wtf lol yr u human bring jetson car already
see blenkers
drive parking lot people driving unusual way possibly pedestrian walking around car full steam ahead
happens multiple waymo car around distinguish reflecting laser beam get confused car laser
car must give heart atack driver road
obviously hit
cant wait get autonomous car free much time
look many american fall asleep driving
regarding plane come know happen bmax know answer need pilot mechanic computer fail
scalable lidar theoretically every vehicle sending laser beam potential interference reflection different vehicle
autonomous car handle accident created human driver would handle
yes please
question camera sensor react thing power line thunderstorm magnetic frequency generated powerful machine still work time fix issue
feed data image captchas take control youre sure system would pick good choice uncommon situation
sensor seem make car loud
know really high pitched sound used trying show dog hears hears high pitch sound yah thats sound cant even hear sound replaced another one hear similar thing far tell sensor damn quiet sound added make one focus em
lebanon road car cant drive
question still would lidar radar system would work car one lane still much dont think system ready replace driver cant work multiple car
ive always thought make car mandatory multiple vehicle offender clean record driver need worry careless driver who already hit multiple speeding ticket duis serious traffic violation
really cant wait tech would love range distance extended well city city ride
eh crash actually partially due pilot understanding autothrottles saying theyre completely right lesson pilot took willing completely turn automatic function get better manual flying faa also encouraging proficiency manual flying programmer engineer type see opposite manner want automate plane completely reduce human error near zero see incident like think see future human loop aviation industry isnt way autopilot fairly standard decade far capability
really like want drive die driving life thing like miserable life
remote terror attack self driving fertilizer truck
already im kidding remote control modern car road nowadays due closed system sorry remote controlled terror attack strawman ignores reality already one least extreme minority case happens
feel actually problem responsibility easy society accept bad driver individual life ruined cause death injury much difficult company accept full liability whole fleet vehicle also personal understanding hybrid traffic actually significantly dangerous human operated traffic kind seems bad taste sponsored company behind point yourre unilaterally trying drive shill
vehicules waymo experience human driver
lmfao pilot trained fly instrument cuz fly night courage conviction fly airplane without pilot also ask passenger u airway flight theyre glad human behind control right youre engaging sophistry people lost faith authority thinly veiled piece specious reasoning meant manufacture consent among dont know better term fake news trending autonomous car madated human behind wheel insurance company underwrite policy human insurance go shill instead youve lost credibility
cost biggest factor keep getting autonomous car
idea isnt get autonomous car idea cabcompanies local bus uber etc replace first reduced need actually owning car reduces amount car road privately owned transport businessens show road instead see like hope become norm year year well city teenager accustomed wont get many privately owned car used city another year people adult making family plan setting plan go family trip reduces well since family car replaced local family transport company scope get become commonplace occurrence city year year family living city would drastically reduced amount family vehicle privately owned road roughly
argentumemperio see appeal implementing autonomous transit large city desire move back city however price right id buy autonomous car personal use
also thing mention many people really enjoy driving car
many actually
contradiction average median
autonomous car weird spot arent useful enough replace car useful enough replace service example let say replace every single car world autonomous one wouldnt magically solve traffic congestion rather instead would simply lower amount time notice reason come amount people want travel time normal car exact thing overall cheaper autonomous vehicle thing would perform better yes people unknown city people tired way unable drive wish get somewhere relatively quickly using taxi service sends autonomous vehicle end cheaper would go bus believe autonomous train next big step protecting environment lowering traffic congestion
self driving safer human driver minute later car screech sudden stop lol
yep say thats supposed disprove actually prof
argentumemperio yeah always tell im top driving form screech sudden stop
couldnt hear buzzing car
ridiculously biased dissapointed chanell
illegal drive future allowed use autonomous vehicle human autonomy mean nothing
play gta real life
agree said video however car arent thing people used get around yes thats main purpose people buy expensive car convenient like feeling something unique able drive also wouldnt really inconvenient wait car come reason people dont use uber taxi time like car use whenever however want like idea driverless car point gave would make want normal car
people dont care driving check everybody looking screen phone whatever care going somewhere easily owning something acknowledges selfperceived status cant wait untill driverless car standard human driver allowed designated track somewhere else
yeah like spaceship manual control human equipped deal factor craft would always spin control
id trust computer trust driver kill hundred thousand people year
sponsored reviewing come bro lol
sure sponsored link stating research also whenever mentioned put onto screen new thing neither sponsoring actual evidence driverless car actually like
honestly pefer better public transportation train trolley bus walkable area u self driving car cool going possible delay better roadcity infrastructure
nah like car start lagging
keep thinking wont signal overlap like car could mess signal another car got picked car like signal remote control key use little like code something idk work
compelling video agree basic concept human make many error road thousand hour car crash youtube recorded dashcams prof arent little disingenuous getting waymo company behind technology sponsor video conflict interest kinda reduces impact im tesla driver fact didnt even mention name confirms there bias intention discus driverless car general

operate ideal condition isnt real life ready dont trust everybody else reorient refresh driving skill show fall road ice road start flooding computer loos visual reference need
congrats mill
derek didnt say technology year away choose option saying werent going ready long time dont know others refering cost effectiveness standered household able purchase one long would take become mainstream saying statistic might think sometimes
million time yes every time somebody tell driverless technology gon na bug kill people respond people even bug kill people think incredibly efficient transportation human driver banned irrelevant car networked coordinate passing speed highway eliminate jam networked traffic data stop light safety becomes easier unpredictable driving behavior
think issue car compared elevator airplane unpredictable human factor could one day boom replace car self driven one itll probably go well never going happen self driven car introduced navigate badly maintained road driven badly behaving human driver naturally problem elevator even though human pilot control airplane adhere lot stricter safety standard regulation far le airplane sky compared car road
waiting million subscriber
driving car simple taking elevator thats cool
bye bye taxi driver sad guy start unemployment
also smash car culture

thewiki true insurance cover cost criminal responsibility take one judge local county anywhere world set precedent jeopardise whole industry
wonder opened first road driverless car
dont mind waymo car worry telsa car limited sensor
going interesting see tesla pure vision v everyone el multiple sensor fight end
hopefully tesla right everyone else wrong every waymo blow embarrassment lol
auscosmo regardless tesla able make work itll never work well simple fact data way observing world result better idea whats going world advanced image processing software still benefit cross referenced scanner yes sufficiently advanced image processing program outperform lidar put together youll get something better
adding layering different kind sensor destructive finding correct solution especially sensor significantly worse variance andor noise
monsterous thats fair point possible estimate uncertainty different sensory modality though work progress believe seems like comical autonomous tesla crash like one video barrel side overturned truck could easily avoided lidar true computer vision improve collect data refine ai architecture situation vision never win eg dense rain fog snow etc
alecompany well case barrel overturned truck year ago heavily reliant radar low information compared camera also plenty situation dense rain fog snow camera see farther human still keep mind tesla vision system camera see farther electromagnetic spectrum avg human sight
replacing car completely train bus metro etc
love video description talk autonomous car road someday theyre road video made one road thats people lot people really understand happening even see video like showed people another video autonomous car driving road police driver reacting asked immediately watching video thought wed autonomous car legally driving road part video asking police ever stopped car saw police saying people still said would year happened ever
driverless car arent future walkable city biking infastructure public transport atleast thats future prefer prefer future le road park privileged idiot demanding getting ever increasing speed people rarely question amount space car infrstructure take prefer keep dystopia book thank much
thats one way question two easily go tandem instance driverless car also mean driverless bus top even walkable city imaginable best public transportation wont eradicate need every single car thus case car preferably driverless
lonestarr yes focus driverless car first put attention atrociously terrible infrastructure make required many unnecessary trip
making city car centric may make job driverless car much easier
driverless car around corner day weve saying ten year real time
imagine one car cliffside road
put get would get one
like driving yeah society would benefit majority people driverless car since suck driving
waymo asked specific word start end esl middle mentioned ever video fine show tesla crash would fine forbidden word crash video wasnt really sad dropped ball much first time multiple year long subscriber
didnt mention make vehicle footage clip simply example disparaging anything particular many viewer wont even know care clip different manufacturer vehicle accident doesnt matter youre talking importance seat belt behalf subaru example care stock footage dummy head crashing steering column inside ford
derek question thing taken machine reflect human evolution need calculate calculated dont need learn flying driving many thing safer let computer uhm dumb survive darwin law might obsolete point view
think video bad clickbait
phoenix profile overbridge
bold assume want car road
believe better certain task driving combination one machine better long task requiring high attention worse distinguishing cyclist bird
sound like waymo propaganda
excellent videoclip dr derek thank despite sponsored waymo found interesting informative since news selfdriving car disappeared mainstream medium year ago initial sensationalist hype agree account one still stick forecast selfdriving vehicle wont become even remotely mainstream sooner year technology functional work nevertheless come road vehicle driver traffic environment weather possible related variable condition world exceedingly diverse place milion mile chandler az wherever waymo performed testing mean nothing relation driving around mumbai india manila philippine bogot colombia even istanbul turkey disrespect intended italian italian awful driver aggressive undisciplined say selfdriving car id like see result million mile driving monsoon season city traffic frantic congested x folly old scarcely maintained vehicle ranging wheel many selfbuilt without homologation kind driven hasty driver exactly zero training
fully autonomous fully automated
personally driver le dont want vehicle yo driver seat see wheel prefer firefly sense want something new something added something old also im curious would react mechanical failure engine flat tire example
question need license drive selfdriving car car need license drive
id personally love driverless car would make way safer road overall probably would lot progress come public transport overall everyone would benefit young people would easier way getting place elderly would pose much threat road thing im worried maintenance envirioments camera could practically blind fogging something else driving
couldve talked bit efficiency well human terrible clearing traffic light shockwave traffic jam
well id feel much safer riding motorcycle know car around werent driven emptional distracted meatbags
imagine car driving moment traffic light
watching car make space entering highway
lot veritasium video started feel like propoganda get mentioned video sponsored company feel like he saying stuff company told say giving actual opinion ive noticed lot video lately
question lidar driverless car street seems work fine happens hundred street lidar signal interfere many lightwave frequency used interfere
driverless car could thing soon talk couple week something vaccine thing usually would take couple year think
car linked together umm hack proof wach ghost shell anime
nearly come tear watching video idk said maybe add green space lit happiness dont know
like self reliant like old gas engine keep running indefinitely decent gas mileage im afraid wont able work thing like making life safe saving environment unless get rid technology entirely including precious gas engine
moral dilemma derek talk deciding spare v hit solvable solving first derek mentioned extremely rare decision even decides wrong every single time super rare situation total amount mistake still much lower human human surely dont solve moral dilemma may objective right solution anyway simply randomizie decision
well thats obvious even self driving car development even started quite obvious consequence human driven vehicle banned road sometime way human drive cheap road without traffic light sign designed autonomous vehicle car moving preplanned route effective safe usual change come human losing right drive thats historical trend name safety comfort people lose right thing gon na sad see future generation people likely live life chamber strapped bed tube coming one side body others another leave chamber covid outside kind infection may kill brick may fall head may break leg stay little chamber robot hard work would way turn people bodiless goo live chamber would done
scanning element waymo safe radiation
every day commute work see dozen dumb decision made unintelligent driving whole imagining every day see another one driver replaced fully autonomous self driving car making smart safe decision make feel like wouldnt take long see egregious user error every feel like brighter future horizon
happens trusting everything big business
immediate problem see prohibitively expensive reason technology yr away adoption
im counting many time change video title
shouldve kept pilot comparison seen pilot bring bird sideways wind pushing hard human much complex computer processor least recognize respect dont minimize bias view autonomous being
drunk driver texting driver death accident cheaperno car insurance due safety le parking space green space thing closer together making walkingbiking place easier productive driving get place fastest due le accident therefore trafficking never running gaselectricity ride cant drive dope freaking death happen
id trust one id like see one deliver slab beer wonnongatta valley night return intact
driverless car work car driverless imagine human driver tbones driverless car wuhan virus mask everyone vaccinated mask mandatory
selfdriving car literally starting yet brain selfdriving motorcycle
already exist
someone doesnt much background knowledge im kind curious radar sensor would work every car road would also use sensor different car interfere also concern someone could purposely disrupt sensor false data possible
raise interesting point often automatic system work well real problem encounter another automatic system try outguess high rate may issue car encounter brand made country prepared little glitchy situation narrowcriteria collision become certainty
idea multiple autonomous vehicle communicate share information instead competing
small road dirt road stuff isnt gps
human control machine machine control human
one day car autonomous dont realize people going give old car new computer operated one go slower right one issue self driving follow speed limit ever exact speed limit ohio michigan thatll get ran flow traffic area usually posted self driving car slow thing congest road unless programmed move traffic instead speed limit dont see many real issue
remember traffic flowing stop light etc far dream moment theyd physically outlaw driving car order make reality intent giving personal vehicle order self driving taxi anytime need go somewhere
driverless vehicle normally run track sure driverless car cool move towards structure society around small individualistic vehicle transit support many people fast cheap environmentally friendly driverless car wont solve pressing issue time theyre solution part driving car problem wouldnt even removed car entirely scale exists course car mainstay family major city exception norm people able move around without car keeping street pollution free human scale isnt future technology train bus bicycle tram today theyre spicy enough government embrace scale need dont time wait car become carbon neutral gon na happen soon enough
would belive eye ten million firefly covered road sat cause theyd fill open road leave traffic past
bruh try india ded google map screw lot
dont dispute benefit driverless car actually embrace want driverless car driving florida week would take dl driver replace robot however dont think people considering shorttomedium term cost switching economy based driverless car million people usa earn living driving talking simply uber doordash parttimers million truck driver alone also city bus school bus taxi tourist industry medical transportation etc thats huge industry tax base let people minimal trade professional education earn decent middle class salary cant simply say retrain million people programmer doesnt work like real world end lot misery unemployment problem associated brunt change felt mostly vulnerable people lower income undereducated immigrant single parent people primarily fill niche economy right dont know good answer dont see anybody giving thought
concern warranted data however dont data future prediction becoming unlikely even larger number especially something volatile economy unemployment rate fluctuated throughout history due many factor including technological advancement human adaptable low chance complete overhaul car automation happen giving exemployees company decided adopt auto chance plan average age truck driver example around average retirement age shortage rise actually many reason automated vehicle im expert think eased fact everything unpredictable people rely driver industry need worry much least year prospective employment really cant say much cost driving lowered company due automation profit margin skyrocket expansion inevitable job still need going demand think know read complicated get youll soon need take factor population growth matthew principle public health issue agree concern never sure impact le aftermath idea store future employment opportunity usa country especially developing one experience innovative faith stranger
trust self driving car trust drive human wheel would mess car ai programming
nerd want driverless automobile lame
propaganda video
imagine driver license must passenger driverless vehicle like tesla bmw automatically drive decides jump driver seat illegal drive till cop came pulled switch seat passenger cop like erm know pulled passenger driver passenger driver automatic drive alrighty youre free go
loved one woke one morning never drove neurological condition keep dependent others provide transportation dream roll car unplug roll tell head grocery store go shopping get back tell car go home
hi derek talked friend video asked good question autonomy tier discussed video regulatory body selfimposed waymo intention car owned people used like normal meant driverless ride share latter would service affordable enough feasible people disability statistically le disposable income effect would largescale rollout public transit infrastructure like bus light rail
autonomous car drive india
rain snow testing hot desert city make feel confident autonomous vehicle deal inclement weather
need remove human driver really achieve safe road
thing reduce car insurance
tbh dont even want car want move somewhere public transport culture
lidar based self driving car better human tesla camera based one banned fully
imagine instead getting bus pas get car pas would absolutely insane cant wait become norm
ive telling people expect car currently last car exactly reason becomes possible order car phone arrive location minute safely inexpensively comfortably drive destination would ever consider owning car ive people say well today using uber lyft something similar say actually taken many ride uber lyft would understand never cheap rarely safe comfortable look forward day last humandriven car leaf road city
like video brilliant elevator analogy genius
im sure would feel passenger selfdriving car im certain feel much safer pedestrian driver taiwan never yeild
im literally manual version exact car rn
plane land visibility without autoland normally time pilot use il instrument landing system lign runway maintain glideslope yes autoland commonly used thing autopilot unable take one thing mention autoland autopilot dont use advanced ai detect traffic runway etc autopilot simply follows route given altitude speed heading autoland system simply follows il glideslope touch air traffic strictly controlled atc air traffic control ensure safety aircraft among many thing ensuring separation traffic routing traffic vector issuing clearance takeoff landing change altitude etc drive car trust someone manage vehicle maintain separation let know safe turn join traffic etc making selfdriving car much complicated least opinion simply organisation road far perfect almost anyone get car join traffic people drive drunk intoxicated sm driving making literally blind situation road something extremely hardly happen aviation edit use autoland bad weather turbulent otherwise high wind situation like pilot manually land plane divert pilot much better computer extensively trained whereas road get certified couple month storm want pilot manually flying plane autopilot usually automatically disengage shall feel maintain stable flight there doubt pilot much better computer computer help eg cruise landing bad visibility
ambulance coming behind stopped red light way go sideways car respond situation advance stop advance stop advance crossed light car may assume pas one go carefully inspecting crossing traffic
p good invest possible hackerhijacking attempt otherwise may people across globe maybe coding caf aiming car system
thank
cat iii autoland pilot ass weather runway length airport approach facility runway condition wet dry decide autoland possible safe also way approach landing roll pilot monitoring aircraft
importantly look air crash pilot left autopilot mid flight auto pilot decided plane crashed due pilot able regain control came immovable object
salem think issue happened boeing nosediving
salem thats u airline pilot fly boeing monitor autopilot time especially approach start something werent expecting disengage
anandkothari safety system max given much control autopilot system
ajaviator mean say safety feature suggested pilot took decision automation come different layer
oh look delamain initiate combat mode
electric waymo car
couldve called waymobile
happens computer vehicle network theyre linked get hacked virus etc
removing car directly full public transport stop designing city around car around people
im worried system failure sensor working made example pilot error airplane pretty sure problem come flying technical issue like pilot take manual control sensor experience icing
another thing done auto car manual cant connecting grid go word need spend long time charging auto car since determine connect disconnect rail built road would provide energy need instead battery perhaps offroad version could hybrid use grid road default gas would allow usage gas reduced minimum providing fallback grid power available knocked road thug
wish widely available often use transit service uberlyft experience firsthand bad people really driving would feel much safer driverless vehicle
idiot siren horn avoid idiot gaming dumb bot
people believe better driver mean describe human intelligent without something compare
reason youre phoenix phoenix absolute best case scenario driverless car driverless car close norm comparison aviation moot ask control prof funded google tell exactly im telling
id like see one driverless car try driving morning blizzard impossible see road snow half foot deep
johnathangross id like see
lonestarr welcome canada snow
johnathangross accident
johnathangross uhhh human shouldnt either
anyone know standard allow ability send car without driver passenger im thinking situation like hiking cycling might send car ahead meet end hike ride
traffic get worse ever year look forward seeing passenger car become driving truck part time sitting car id vote phone distraction seem worst hold lap try hide see keep looking im way condoning wouldnt worry getting caught would make better seems worse mainly rush hour people seem feel confident stop go slower traffic time day even season change driver look middle day bulk elderly generally ok sometimes slow summer state tourist unconfident unfamiliar thing also people excessively speed mph weekend pandemic made worse
friend mine phd artificial intelligence conversation hit topic autonomous driving asked autonomous driving told human being stupid still question accident happens responsible accountable driver owns car suppose one day everyone wan na buy hisherself autonomous car car maker get blame whats fuel consumption rate think kind sophistication requires tremendous amount energy electric car autonomous impact would autonomous drive energy consumption
last thing want road car kind car honest
heck send one ill let drive around heap
yeah see driverless car better people average dont realize fully admit drove attention wouldnt always kill people time admit somethings arent good
know would saferbicycles train metro bus
oh god simple solution intersection nightmare expected order self driving car bike rack every intersection take bike across gon na build city underpass like horrible utopian like dystopian idea multiple street level thats gon na affordable
yea rip pedestrian bikers future intersection end like lol youre still going need stoplight crosswalk even car get advanced enough need traffic purpose
someone plan hack car try destroy sensor without knowing prolly think car good isnt sensor get covered dust dirt ai unable sense would catastrophic
video give hope traumatized person almost died car crash would feel much safe inside autonomous vehicle doubt trust people idea hell let many unskilled people drive car something put life many one danger driver important task worry
agreed think people prefer human driver dont realise dangerous human driver common youtube literally full stupid human driver causing accident many autonomous car accident youtube
insurance company must shitting brick trying figure still force protection vehicle
think autonomous car good idea every car autonomous people would probably still want ramble rock go mud bogging etc automatic car good streamlining traffic populated area
there way transport large amount people pedestrianless road know something like train something
yes still car suck
work great slam brake reason pedestrian run stationary usually slam brake reason im guessing still would ride get nap
road look nice enough game
one problem see people gon na want automated car may emergency need straight away cant wait available car still believe stay driving service still need option buy one
car aint going survive india
someone get hit blame driver manufacturer
accident dont drive human choice people dont think going get accident flawed logic drive human choice difference cost individual day person told save driverless vehicle get one reason believe future technology car truck company reduce cost ship good driverless truck entire shipping industry change one million truck driver america id concerned
imagine car controlled people computer kid manage access one thinking gta super reality graphic
old one build newest generation waymo car
government come new way fining driver
canadian want know work ice snow
answer well thats test southwest
everybody gangsta till car turn autobot
firefly car going like ac agree statement lot would car look like never ever hit maximize comfort seatbelt pedal computer dashboard console lot storage space stuff bet able buy self driving suv whole camping setup terrain mode
real issue driverless car come emergency situation might sink hole middle road flood riot active shooter legitimate circumstance although exceedingly rare may need intentionally hit someone car mugger walk front self driving car going stop let rob car drive time great need manual override
yeah thats great point hadnt even thought
aww one step closer needing competence live life exciting
one step closer killed incompetence others id say yes thats exciting
comparison involve situation pedestrian vehicle computer tech tell every computer fails time time happens computer crash mph computer programed happens road clear side person directing traffic simple slow stop sign video show flaw slam break reason think pedestrian going enter crosswalk great chance rear ended mention uber car one clean mess left behind rude passenger want wait ride door open find last passenger drunk threw seat blame driver cutting waymo ran red light ive driven mile usually anticipate driver might experience avoid accident million professional driver tell politician need reelected would vote fire voter
people sworn last year would flying car dont dangerous like autonomous car think correct check jetsons back future want accident foot air pity poor people love technology sometimes get little far ahead even work car must ai ai dangerous toy ever played spoke said episode computer excellent servant would like run
would fine using autonomous car would lot comfortable car autonomous didnt worry idiot behind wheel car
consider also make possible disabled car like blind ppl cant move arm properly
oooh totally changed thumbnail
car autopiloted would need speed bump traffic light traffic rule
road regulate build program patch managed people cant afford good self driving car end cheapo one run every body problem self driving car problem everything tech human
think itll make driving safer car voice recognition voice recognition would recognize owner hisher sober state person really drunk theyd talk differently voice recognition would pick lock potential driving
voice recognition hardly tell yes think sophisticated enough massproduction scale read drunkenness
alright im convinced get road keep making better cheaper human level driving
keep making cheaper even bother buying one order pick whenever need one itll time
lonestarr even price cheaper per mile owning car
vanderkarl short guess look fleet waymo already ai trained scaling expensive buying new car outfitting actually lead fewer car road hope doubt car manufacturer craving exclusive deal
sadly video miss biggest problem driverless car car dependancy inherrently unsustainable wed much better public transit bike infrastructe pedestrian friendly place similar city planning done netherlands
biggest issue going people driving old car hot rod classic old x ect never convince people give amazing yet fully human operated vehicle long new driverless vehicle still handle decent percentage manual driver could work buy dont believe ever remove human error road completely
imagine able go party gathering drink probably many hop car tell take home worst case scenario wake morning back car drunk driving instantly thing past
still year away tech good enough
like year certain city year rural area sure though
future full autonomous driving alone full autonomous driving conjunction input people like steer like drive period time like completely control car etc etc etc autonomous driving thing like traction control activate adapts corrects gap driving dont want accelerate neither break dont worry accelerate break want steer problem rest covered detect input like like use complete rest safely manner unless turn
safety want people root driverless car need tell one day get drunk car come pick
self landing plane fine self docking elite dangerous
people tesla already play phone cut biking biking trail intersection system good enough yield im going mph tree bush obfuscating path crossing ill content
plane infrastructure land automatically set procedure time elevator etccomputers great executing specific pre programmed task within limit stupid think ohh night rain weather condition make dangerous machine driving fact road unexpected happen thing machine cant account make crucial choice needed either machine drive road built mind human still needed waymo car city special infrastructure care put road mention driver made aware testing ground obviously cherry picked case city going work well car
nonsense propaganda self driving car like year away safe road
downside driverless car dont get road rage speed
driverless car cool city designed walking better
correct
true
driverless car bad
cant save u canada though youd tear rebuild entirety city dont choice anymore rest world walking bike public transportation main focus instance car required driverless way one question
dude guy u special small vehicle drive around supermarket remove thing trying rebuild city
pay regulator like everyone else
robot car ill stop completely keep hooman safe bicyclist run car anyway
lol
question would fare longer trip like interstate highway
benjamincarlson theyd fare fine
benjamincarlson lot easier get interstate right neighborhood dangerous thing interstate stake speed regularized system reduces variable play neighborhood driveway could car backing every intersection idiot every crosswalk vulnerable pedestrian there lot detect careful
benjamincarlson interstate would easiesttry driving city almost marking dont pain often pot hole people parking far road turn single lane
one thing surprise lack people willingness read one thing ability people underestimate quickly technology increasing past bottom jcurve guess im also surprised much folk overestimate ability compared computer listen folk arent good computer anything computer brain baby surpass u nearly every way move forward time computer become part u two u longer readily told apart
wasnt entirely sold idea loved fantasy road trip driving feel bit comfortable comparison elevator car future hear let embrace dude walking mile cause wont get driverless car
capable cross country trip onboard
feeling like getting elevator autonomous car feel like year sure give take year two
want autonomous vehicle yesterday doesnt scare btw love channel bless
get rid car etc make autonomous one
many people including en joy driving want force consider reduced quality life u human navigate location get autonomous vehicle able navigate loacations andor along path correctly stored database human decide ignore rule emergency machine decide ignore rule eg denmark car turned emergency ambulance violate speed limit etc responsibility driver like privacy know hard enough allready get car wont record car time fast driving etc stupid gadget people seem crave trust maker autonomous car respect privacy maker device internet thing far happy spy u give u better customer experience hacking similar device capabable communicating hacked corrupted eg someone might make ford car nyc refuse move imagine chaos eg imagine someone ordering car go location different one intended go lock car dont like sorrounding sort automated gadget thing trivially dont want like fat people floating chair walle movie
noahljsg rally naive trolling messing around computer year thing along way whether consider life expenience realistic real met people emergency speeding thing dont know many time encountered system malfunction due mundane error data andor bad assumption designer eg sometimes use program get travel reimbursement insert waypoint two address travelled otherwise system pick route locked gate would autonomous car deal without person manually inserting waypoint think wrong idea real world btw walk ride bicycle frequently drive car
waymo editorial review video
long tesla amazon involved maybe work
dont want driving car emotional experience self driving car take away automatic transition far enough cross line u car guy
sadly dont think probably majority society would care use car commute may even like driving think way usa fix build much better public transport system already get people doesnt like driving road may take licensing system seriously like germany road would much safer speed limit raised traffic jam severe nowadays
yeah imagine situation government ability forcefully pull self driving car cop could pull digitally idea alone always turned away idea
already human police officer car likely outperform car driving ability
noahljsg im saying remove possibility even ability escape would give government total control
nsarmoredfrog yeah im sure totally safe
car loud walking around outside vehicle
taxi driver left chat
driving fun
would trust x time human eats us phone look left right get bored sleepy late work speed want adrenaline rush saw fast furious want overtake dangerously muh gawd damn snail dont sit behind one someone epillepsy wheel old manwoman heart attack
try downtown bombay
like autonomous vehicle concern wasnt answer video safe hack controlled manipulated thirdparty worst blackhat countermeasure ever occur
noahljsg understandable ordinary person unlikely get hacked nothing im interested know idea
cant people right average driver person different definition good driver couldnt hundred different people think average could correct based interpretation good driver anything dunningkruger effect really say knew shitty driver probably lot fender bender near miss passenger feedback middle finger salute driver come conclusion
think car need chip broadcasting atm autocars read process make decision
dont worry happen denier comment vocal minority always go awful quiet technological progress come fruition
human error joke india everyone think god third eye
hacker system glitch battery rain man whole career
belong ygs episode hacker arent really issue car could emergency stop passenger could press assistance button tell car went route system glitch happen would ironed time car widespread electric car use battery work fine
futuretaken future cry easly disable emergacy button wanted since electronic mf really thinking everything perfect nothing go wrong yeah id like see go highway back seat system randomly desides make right turn seen enough crash trust
possible today majority train still relying human
make sense americain road essentially created perfect rule following robot human think self driving car massive safety boost also think huge amount problem road design flaw couple people dedicated massive space taking vehicle one wonder reverse engineering train
seems nice try italian road
imagine technology implanted brain blind people anymore
germany win study germany year ago showed slightly german driver think way average driver think beat u german driver ha dont mean michael schuhmacher
one thing consider easy would hacker take control one car force wreck purposely kill passenger
proof concept allready done modern nonautonomous car lot modern car sort computerized control communicate virelessly sorroundings even via cell phone system demonstrated one could take control brake speeder etc remotely overriding driver input
elon musk seen video haha used elevator example om open ai show
here something else consider computer malfunction
stop think moment benefit video like answer maker driverless car
dont buy elevator plane analogy elevator plane running autonomously involve agent case equip much better sensor specifically designed lifting people landing lot complexity autonomous driving understanding predicting behavior agent including driver pedestrian using inexpensive sensor much harder problem solve
every single car road driverless heck yeah
next step datalaw force car save video like month gps position time police use viechle data solve crime spy people tax purpose see coming
cant wait technology remove steering wheel vehicle public road many day see rude people think best skill better anyone else road tailgating truck driver interstate driver chewed quitting time got car cant wait happen derek excellent video thank
saying shoot invisible laser beam good way conspiracy nut accuse waymo government initiative create cancer ray control populace
see veritasium stand human warring robot
thats good much driverless taxi cost compared normal one
probably first cool le company get driverless taxi competition
futuretaken agreed itll take long time reach point normalcy though
someone like go road get wd situation fun still think self driving car place like big city way go imagine traffic ever
road situation would far easier self driving car far le variable deal le predicting driver car would basically alone able purly focus terain driving
switchdeck see mean thatd great getting drunk people home bonfire navigating tricky terrain etc
hey look thumbnail title change hhmmh
well good idea kinda vulnerable like think would happen camera car going rain water thing camera doesnt kind shielding invincibility water unless water proof something
future
car lidar camera youre going hit mistake dont want car carjacked riskfree also resistant vehicle vandalism say someone spray painting camera sensor red light example face covered run little risk identified vehicle pretty much dead road
best thing autonomous car get rid ego car autonomous daily commute would cut half
problem driverless car rely environment mostly time everywhere would want go marked gps system entire neighborhood house shown gps open field stub road coming wouldnt able go way home unless car programmed realize gps wrong eventually fixed gps accurate updated regularly sensor car could tell road continues would like still able shift gear turn wheel
think accident happenpeople speeding theyre influence theyre distracted spoken talking camera driving
car lobby great job trying convince world need give lot money car manufacturer come fix inherently unsafe ecologically fatal system sth ai probably work politics follow instead using investing safe environmentally friendly system already available heard youre train check phone put makeup yes even sleep commuting decade crazy stuff let make city giant parking lot selfdriving car yay really like channel video show naive narrow view mobility
want train city put train train simply work people know dont spend entire life inside concrete hell
yeah youre tempe chandler see waymo car place never cause problem excited become norm
cant wait see place
bingulid chingchongulus number one um wrong
bingulid chingchongulus different introduction computer workplace

self driving car automatically perform safety stop case person step road mean city pedestrian power stop car stepping road think potential intentionally disrupt traffic main reason autonomous car endless party street
law put place like randomly walk road get hit fault
futuretaken excactly person video said big reason autonomous vehicle safety look big reason autonomous vehicle cause restriction pedestrian cyclist
five min ca freeway want everyone ai car
autonomous car great one issue technology likely going hand big corporation control car entire planet one got hacked guy went postal could lead million car getting malicious softwareupdate going rogue killing people could decide bad person dont conform googely way criticize ccp lock traffic end danger technology people abusing
mention majority car driverless simplify deigns watch pedestrian n cyclist n like
dunce absolute rube driverless vehicle fix fundamental problem heart traffic existence car need stop investing much shaky ethical nightmare technology put money transportation system actually work proven efficient cause fewer death automobile train bus pedestrianbike path like bro really need everybody city ton steel really dont

young elevator father office manned got drive occasionally went saturday called driver elevator operator havent ever seen listened musical hair
hair came late thats good year elevator became thing make sense terminology would change time
kaldokaldo nope im talking late downtown brooklyn ny office building even today freight elevator always operator bless union
driverless car used freak due trust issue discussed video remembered like year old behind wheel
give reason shouldnt driverless vehicle
great video always laugh hear people hugely optimistic vision future end video see future rise autonomous vehicle mean le traffic fewer car road green space lol history shown human being always seem expand fill capacity mean figure way something efficiently doesnt mean le exact opposite get riding car becomes simpler cheaper efficient likely riding car number trip people take increase hardly think reduce road system build green space improve car easily navigate way intersection increase number car road get traffic jam even autonomous vehicle
training car weather ice etc always going edge case real world real driver could cope ai fails unexpected real world especially area outside suburban arizona lot unexpected
like video lot also feel like still shouldnt want want normal driver yes want le car altogether since car cause pedestrian problem watching city plannersimilar guy
lot autonomous car road wont lidar scanner interfere
damn really implying gung ho automation like wanting people die wow
hell flip confused
young remember loved car wanted drive pedal go karts kid loved riding around even reversing imaginary parking spot found whole experience engaging pleasurable fast forward decade extremely eager get car passed test soon possibly could year passed test still enjoy driving ive never become bored drive manual car simply enjoyable engaging lack manual transmission main reason find hard get excited electric car even though agree need alternative gaspetrol powered car sake planet lot people car simply mean get b understand people autonomous car appealing biggest concern safety someone life long love car act driving however autonomous car awful prospect autonomous car hit road near perfect safety record matter time nonautonomous car banned may argue safety important thing philosophical stand point disagree think abandonment autonomy bad thing think living world potential danger taking responsibility action important part human experience ive say decided leave deleted two paragraph wasnt even finished yet getting far offtopic
meh youll probably licence taken away dead worry experience people say like driving drive erratic manner make move ordinary day day driving stressful b driver passenger hate riding lead footed friend
agree interesting far scroll find someone perspective would thought car enthusiast would common seems people dont care driving day might symptom boring modern car become
jaxinblax think likely many people viewing video idea self driving car there tendency people seek information reinforces idea preference andor belief already rather challenge watched video case compelling reason favour self driving car aside expected focus safety despite fact enjoy driving generally disagree philosophical level spend life inside bubble nothing bad ever happen u happen think correlation rising level mental health issue modern lifestyle becoming increasingly detached world around u think autonomous car would contribute detachment
cant agree maybe one day driving rich privileged afford drive race track unless like ruraloffroad area nowadays esp electric car built let computer guide even advice level engagement people call rawness petrol head wanted fading away right sadly people driving commute car tool may even like driving sometimes even making road horrible place eg passing lane hoggers talk car guy driving like maniac road may even slight sense road discipline good sense control car type people adopt driverless car safe driving waste time energy driving long already loving sad engine getting smaller thing going electric talk manual transmission cant even hydraulic steering day however majority society car enthusiast would higher speed limit speed trap money generator conservative speed limit better lane discipline better culture probably like germany inevitably fully autonomous driving may take control someday driving public road may even become illegal
riding grace replying comment cant see accidentally leave comment wrong video clear youre getting

reason controller technique lyapunov robust controller nonlinear system still used physical machine controller never fail nature continuous time space big problem ai provide security much even train network using datasets available world never get error trainning network eventually ai system going fail nature make mistake soon later thats using ai still dangerous human
feelfelt absolutely terrible trust man
drove wrong side road human driver dint hit shill elsewhere derek
something bad happens system protect people inside car outside car choose one scientist also knowledge life want surrender fate science worst priest human history openly declare dont soul
want world car work everywhere need everyone car car cant get confused always know car
better public transport self driving car
first great video agree lot people skeptical driverless taxi great future achieve think theyll ready soon im qualified answer however derek seems biased towards sponsorship personally see he big fan though make argument overoptimistic yes elevator train become driverless limited movement option traffic plane traffic controlled professional company regulate movement trajectory car hand driven rando people obligation way chaotic reason car accident plane accident would seem imply replacing human machine improve safety dominant replacement like would agree people selfish many enjoy feel driving theyll demand right able drive car even driverless car option many place biggest problem driving environment human driver followed rule like machine would swell dont sometimes unintentionally yes driverless car accumulated driving experience human driver doesnt make better driver part driving predicting driver react mean need mental model human think something come free human allows better driver despite much lower experience
reminds incident robot movie
guarantee take waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer minute feel comfortable actually painfully stupid thing say assume people would agree minute driving gon na put nearly enough scenario confident need year testing human arent scared im touching thing
called firefly designer fan show
landing taking plane lot simpler driving car need really data runway driving car requires constant input data surrounding area constantly try predict another people might there level assumption inference required driving dont think achieve without ai flying plane isnt really hard different vehicle making leap computer land plane able drive car nowhere near simple yeah maybe someday self driving car norm doubt dont think theyre yet people certainly arent yet
driverless car obsolete urban area smart thing desing city human scale walk bike transport improvement regular car transport tho
think main concern autonomous driving vehicle potential risk faultypoorly maintained censor team professional maintaining vehicle daily basis probably wont issue otherwise faulty censor may cause accident way would plane
noahljsg agreed think cost maintain replace censor put lot people buying guess probably le issue target public transportation sector
finally someone standpoint like im self driving car dont think slowly fazing lane keep assist stuff cause technology help driver mess physically worse driver ave computer compensate think car stay entirely manual completely automated inbetween
drive old vw beetle cv dont pay attention fly road next somewhat narrow corner wet road surface didnt berak early enough modernish car fly car dont grip weird reason back way fatality occured car occupant pedestrian although people travelled way le car strange system safety feature actually helped
im currently taking driving lesson buy feel like almost useless
there title make sound like tesla pocket
reason road dangerous place stupid people allowed drive remove people equation entirely safer riding skateboard
im best reader pretty sure im good driver based reaction time avoiding crash bad driver think theyre good driver cuz theyre delusional
trusting like feeling driving like connected car bad driver type car u good driver driving around
one thing im really looking forward dont hear brought enough driverless car could literally eliminate traffic think every vehicle road driving perfectly logically without distraction emotional decision making common reason traffic jam would cease cutting line someone forgot exit getting idiot intentionally cutting people inflate ego likely le cartoperson ratio take road space dont need huge pickup van commuting work consider also potential driverless car communicating one another constantly real time achieve swifter merging exiting turning subtle increase decrease speed car would otherwise cut five minute would eliminate time taken wait car get way need merge turn whatever car passenger going late connecting train ride flight appointment could automatically prioritized car moving way letting pas overall id expect street full autonomous vehicle cut time road huge margin im excited
lifetime real world lot harder suburban arizona
erikdj really sure thats supposed mean road road car carsobviously everywhere like mesa dont figure itd difficult adapt current selfdriving vehicle scenario significantly different current environment
video made official sellout
nondriver im really looking forward getting cheap taxi ride driverless car
considering tesla fully driverless upgrade isnt fully driverless monthly payment buying actual vehicle im sure cheap thing
pabloramirez owning driverless car wont cheap running taxi service driverless car way cheaper lead cheaper ride compare extra salary taxi driver obvious
diedertspijkerboer comparison would like putting price big mac wage mcdonalds worker lol
pabloramirez im sure understand
since dont drive driverless car would feel like bus train something im already used
yeah except full stupid noisy stinking sick crazy criminal annoying people
timokreuzer thats case live anyway yes bus train like especially late night day evening worry driverless taxi would someone sick though maybe interior cam spot sort thing
exactly train thought
wonder dont start driverless train shouldnt easier could way train
lonestarr already exist
selfdriving obvious accident caused small percentage bad driver selfdriving car better replace making driving test stricter road already safer
dont like toxic waste battery cant drive bus train bike
cherry picked view driverless car main problem system adapt unkown well something fails something car trained specifically handle shut worse cause serious problem others mentioned comment super easy people screw car slapping stuff onto stop sign etc issue like resolved car know handle large majority dangerous fringe case debris ground flung air highway causing dangerous projectile quick example start viable still though id rather see stuff pushed public transit individual vehicle better everyone overall
think missed bit whole point fleet vehicle would become major mode transit probably publicly owned owned individual either derek pointed much time average person car sitting parked
like driving make trip feel lot shorter go holiday always drive germany middel nicht make lot time car ar going blast autobahn kmh even lot fun
though current example probably never see people ride horse road
every technological revolution till blue collar job people slide little extra training time isnt case progress without legislation company replace driver driver le vehicle must retrain driver something else massive unemployment problem think climate change bad wait till million human find without job practically overnight population explode
dont want car need city designed walkable like lot european city need suburb like many older style suburb walk within minute anything need
anyone paying attention bad people drive trust self driving car people
took shot
dont want self driving car want boring thing like public transit come regularly dont need schedule want fast passenger rail accessible easy preferable suffering airport want city arent built around carsasdefault
mean supposed say yeah actually figured itd nice kill people make money xd mean think probably make road safer doesnt seem like right question ask get answer person think question better said make road safer way added video watch later couple week ago current watching unrelated current thumbnail title
mom shes blind one eye cant drive evening night also shes likely get crash dream car
one question maximum speed set
isnt one
expect driverless boat venice
would like see car handle pot hole big enough turn truck road cow dog sleeping midway mud road road signal stop road used sidewalk sidewalk full stall india
dude guy watch video still believe human better autonomous vehicle im genuinely curious would make trust human known make error vehicle simulated driving thousand time different variable scary thinking might wrong think scenario maybe human intervention would reduce risk every car road autonomous impossible single motor vehicle accident ever almost always one case someone running stationary vehicle maybe youre scared car cant drive dirt road reason keep seeing example brought ive seen plenty long curvy country road know driving congested city pedestrian sign light bikers vehicle x harder following dusty trail
cant wait every car autonomous attaching siren bike slide traffick
monster respect
already imagine ppl italy calling car dismantling selling body part
took old wendover video think said hate old content
crucial short documentary watch youtube thank watching connection short documentary
im worried software im worried vulnerability hacking bad could imagine ransom demanding hacker went crashed car
still way safer imagine often could happen imagine many people drive drunk every day
sabotaging car isnt stretch mess important function someone who onto c hacking selfdriving car doesnt seem likely maybe worst malicious company manufacturing rigging seems like worst case scenario im sure wed something place prevent happening mass scale
mewpurpur much difficulty scale million car registered u alone
kaldokaldo car dont anything car current design
worry like unrealistic dream many situation like apply aspect life exist already dont random hacker take control plane already dont trap people elevator theaten cut cable
there totally unavoidable collision car ejects air open airbags come like bouncy ball
problem waymo scam produced k mini van lidar wrong tech work
solution people want autonomous public transport people carrying capacity would make much sense need reduce reliance personal single occupancy vehicle
sponsored waymo talk one scenario human crash plane show tesla driving truck great video otherwise
nice good hacker decide target car cybersecurity serious issue often discussed talking driverless car even nowadays car could easy target electronics put software connectivity car gap could leave attack
want
drink drive lol
would really nice car monthly charge thats cheaper gas insurance regular car payment mention garage parking space could strengthen argument minimum parking requirement make realestate affordable across board need make trendy
note asiana flight one died accident people killed unrelated crash im sure one ran first responder
would trust technology life
remember almost killed semi driver fallen asleep hit head survived threw truck drift partly ditch barely curl around front driver side bumper semi maneuver could simply never reproduced driverless vehicle scenario autonomous vehicle wouldnt typing world driverless vehicle would sweet case absolutely way autonomous car safer intuition long human still behind wheel
imagine time u order pick certain time time
cop go cop dog robot dog go missing cant yell follow nother car
roading nascar line whats point life
problem lot job transportation industry would go away
rather drive im ditching idea ford ranger
derek definitely need interview people get comprehensive view real challenge around autonomous vehicle jeff speck jeffspeckfaicp joe minicozzi joeurbanthree jarrett walker humantransit youre welcome likely give real context car operate
comparing driverless elevator driverless car seems way farstretched difference degree freedom movement two even close
imagine car learned thing need learn electric vehicle charging station fully automatic job need maintenance
car road automated share network see matter far fast would confidently ride fully autonomous car
math science courage
first time actually say person idea he talking come automation ai
technology definitely still ten year away kind actual large scale adoption technology exists doesnt mean
well said people automotive industry think like year away optimistic one say develop software hardware automotive way speed develop entertainment bug occurs annoyance like videogame silly thing life death risk
admit didnt expect technology get sophisticated quickly im also pretty sure take least decade available larger scale china japan probably earlier germany probably take year even legal might take year make humandriving illegal
timokreuzer tbh dont think ever make illegal drive would legit phase car time go harder find get car personally drive
night driving slowed way saw brown deer dried brown hill like forty fifty yardsmeters road facing toward soon make self driving car account thing like maybe go full scale also price constraint factor big time take economy scale take effect
dsn yes phase make harder population fine convenient argue selfdriving risk introduce law make difficult owning gun germany like everything used politically mention confirming never happen suggest saying planned make argument introduce way people ok ignore promised change law rinse repeat
company turn car reason lose job thank want something fix something another company turn disable remove global company interested im paying subscription waiting update remove equation ill buy one dont see happening
never come pas uncontrolled intersection wont exist hostile place human system urban setting dystopian best implementing lower speed limit urban setting one better outcome pedestrian
eliminating pedestrian surest way reduce pedestrian incident
kaldokaldo eliminating car much better way
camille vg g ha point made traffic light wont exist good luck crossing road
oh phone
feel overselling tech know technology theoretically still many unpredictable variable especially urban area system performs well allowed travel select area thoroughly trained operate say driverless car might perform better average driver youre already safe driver benefit nearly obvious
well need keep mind people perceive average driver cant actually case one may think theyre good driver good driver doesnt anything change fact majority accident due human error mention people becoming worse worse paying attention whilst driving people smoke makeup text people scroll social medium honestly scary many people flying road even periodically looking phone
allowed one area company allowed put area yet
agree first half technology good extremely extensively trained specific area performs much worse outside area disagree usual illusion good driver thus waymo ist much better operating area accept fact circumstance waymo better u yes also every single one u included clear advantage technology already perception clear stats
thing already safe driver people seriously overestimate skill one better matter good consider
driverless car better average person there nobody loses road youre already safe driver benefit car taking personally may useful nobody forcing use selfdriving car first place still drive even best driver world get hit someone else driving poorly mean even personally wouldnt benefit car taking benefit driverless car becoming common raise average skill level vehicle road make everyone safer
ooooooh fun prank would driving waymo siren blasting speaker window lmao
everyone talking would safe like drive ye traffic jam like time driving relaxed putting foot dont want say goodbye neither want go circuit drive im already annoyed electric car coming yes pull away faster ill miss sound put foot ill miss shifting gear drive manual im european phase probably dangerous people trusting software isnt fully trustworthy talking car video tesla ramming truck already side hope option drive manual stay doesnt become something past dont want turn key like james may said auto driving vehicle around decade called taxi bus xp
full support self driving car ultimately getting human driver road ala love drive well see
even video think autonomous car bad idea especially combination unlimited possible event could occur think need rail like system people still travel invididually
literally every car road interconnected using network could eliminate traffic backup grid would know everyone going merge change lane optimal method possible cruise mph rush hour without ever worrying chance accident
level autonomous car year away wont buy one make majority car road even maybe
automated bus individual car need public transportation another taxi service novelty edit got ta add looking make beautiful ballet autonomous car hell going try walk across street goal shouldnt automatize car reduce necessity much possible start looking forward stuff like actual infrastructure
real driverless car possible
emma still real driverless car impossible
europe several member state taxi driver managed wipe huber map using ridiculous excuse happily accepted national government imagine long take eu politics let happen safe nobody interest autonomous car vote taxi driver family likely idiotic technofobic group g fighter similar year frankly optimistic
taxi regulated lot rule ber refused respect fair competition one provider restricted rule isnt restricted many issue ber driver complying different nation tax legislation
carlalex one way seeing thing surely true one side barricade side barricade state taxi driver license closed nr granted local government ensuring closed market conpetition detriment freedom enterprise clearly final cost applied citizen moreover tax regulation could appliedextended uber would meant free market real competition wich clearly seen deadly poison relevant corporation member state fact remains see corporation self driving car allowed regardless safe
called elevator operator
extremely large cause car crash people tired drive way alcohol driverless car would remove risk well
still kinda triggered tesla didnt incorporate radar lidar literally better every way fact cost bit look ugly cost totally worth amount life could save
good luck downtown santiago de chile
way work one day lane road right lane noticed guy behind paying attention looking likely phone got left lane light front red stayed red least car per lane stopped slowed stopped watched guy originally behind stayed right lane brake smash car front stopped least second would moved lane trust one constantly scanning surroundings especially anticipating traffic ahead might affect traffic around make certain assumption keep safe assuming truck going aggressive get front ill leave even room normally would time truck indeed quickly move front turn signal hit brake sped unnecessarily also generally hand hovering horn certain situation one lane highway nearly stopped another moving quickly often ive seen people pull lane moving depth perception person moving quickly hit
people like driving
like idea self drive car isnt yet particularly uk relatively small country lot narrow curvy road million car plus bike people lorry bicycle car year old technology installed
driverless automation great aslong normal driving still option might seem like duh time thought wed never see car without standard transmission option
actually disagree hope eventually people driving isnt option currently every people die car accident u way high make virtual driver vastly reduce number id rather self driving car human prefer self driving car soon safe human
abebb car arent driving though im afraid art racing would killed somewhat
cmon guy quick ill need driver license year
driverless car go government private company allow go want stop car elevator
whole thing advertisement packaged educational video
course ai last year included discussion trolley problem got annoyed people wouldnt accept idea self driving car wouldnt end kind situation
know like car going mile per hour hit either one people car wouldnt going fast came situation would stop
noone talk people lose job job driving
inside car ago weird seeing steering wheel
another thing automatic car road safer get share information car know accident several hundred meter ahead car could networked mesh nearest car drive safely possible relative
driver consider average driver actually might right youre talking average median depends metric chose average statistical distribution let say use number road kill reference driver ever kill anyone leading mean kill rate kill per driver anyone whose count zero better average metric chose
im bit uneasy waymo sponsoring video quite bias isnt derek give worldwide road fatality figure occur city like bombay nairobi manilla unpaved trail phoenix az exactly representative u experience im paris france
want bus train stop developing inefficient singleperson transport
im sure million mile example show neural network hundred banana different angle get good accuracy show baby done example obviously thing learn different rate liked video big advocate self driving car
love driver seatbelt fastened like invisible ghost driver realize probably silence seatbelt reminder still tickle brain
also fact steering wheel turn car drive hope keep dont even need steering wheel anymore cause entertaining
driverless car solution problem car driver safe world need environmentally friendly reliable public transport car driverless car boomer fantasy like living mar know im fantasy applies rich country good infrastructure world dont p brilliant content way
see people using sirene thingy way troll people traffic jam full car siren bruce mighty moment guess
brings new thought autonomous car save people year going balance population growth
f made good point subject listed pro arent negative point topic thats really subjective made commercial fully informative video autonomous vehicle stated half fact favor get sponsored people vehicle shouldnt influence shouldnt sponsoring presented pro con let weigh
cant drive intention learn however sometime situation arise need personal vehicle errand would really open could make electric solve two problem adoption
think self driving car cool bit wrong solution wrong problem car bad know really space inefficient use way much energy per mile human transported home country capital budapest average people car vary bad compared train even bus think many people fit bus compared like car use amount space road consume amount energy gasoline diesel fit whole lot human yeah self driving car cool useful cant put public transport everywhere wont solve traffic problem especially big city need bike public transport
clear weather visibility km see stop light lit enough brightly km
damn want classic caddy fleetwood thats limo id like cruise around yeah know wouldnt nearly good driver autonomous car itd nice take sunday ride sometimes
think real breakpoint buy driverless car need license ride stand seems like itll replace taxi ridesharing service area people need see technology good need good human able better problem arent nearly good visual thing human
question happens person inside dy due hart attack car finish designation kid happy grandma coming visit see corpse delivered cant wait read news happening
thats much better driver heart attack killing everyone car accident
question lidar system still work catching load dead fliesinsects car detects dirty lidar car stop immediately go parking spot happening highway percentage dirty sensor allowed continues driving p technology used instantly industrialhighway area
like drive car hobby id use autonomous car drive dont want otherwise screw lol
autonomous car might reduce accident wont reduce traffic provide alternative way getting people want go car whether manual automated last resort
europe much narrower road lot tight situation handle autonomous vehicle tend stop take forever technology seems much farer away compared u
wonder treat pot hole big enough sink small kid india
exciting future err sort present
someone sitting desk writing code may driving car year ready turn key
plane signal ground help approach similar approach could followed car feeding information stationary transmitter
want car
deadpan oboe paradoxically scrub triangle electrophysiologically deceive alongside majestic cake tight miscreant horse
another worry happen taxi driver becomes worldwide hopefully still able keep job especially car glitch
simple argument technology requires software branded licensed company want money pay road beater tomorrow name safety legally mandated vehicle allowed public road without sophisticated communication system operated profiting organization effectively increasing barrier entry self directed transport force people utilizing service business public transport shockingly glaring issue anyone isnt completely touch majority people live
feel sorry people used control elevator losing job automatic elevator hopeful got new job
im saying im good driver always get first
get around challenge lidar interfering heavy traffic congested intersection
change frequency slightly imagine make unique light signature
montgomeryfrenwheringwerth laser frequency fixed
libertylute would imagine radio different station use different frequency doubt one specific frequency would work lidar
think ppl worried others driver robot trusting life robotits also trusting life others common sense witch make scary car driven robot thats another thingi feel lot safer
ppl dont trust driverless car there going accident theyd feel better fault
camera
clicked red arrow saw click bait video nice job thumbnail title
argument self driving car dont cheaper always interesting completely lacking actual evidence odds something like leased vehicle system drastically expensive vehicle owner actually pay second hand vehicle drastically higher le expensive
firstly would true crappy preowned vehicle secondly taking account indirect cost everyone paying think repurposing parking lot space lot community owned
would leased vehicle system letting driverless car sit garageparking lot hr day anything itd uber system without labor cost
yomin auto manufacturer could charge monthlyyearly service use whichever option make money
drackar uber operate like uber
futuretaken mean loss personal information value
well transportation cheaper company consumer profit shareholder demand price paid higher
wtf thats level driving million mile alot mile go ok system
statistic show number taxi driver chauffeur united state may people employed taxi driver chauffeur united state
need test vehicle different situation pothole road dirt road short adversity
tree falling road storm blizzard course pretty good adverse condition vehicle train better
im living place snow clear ice road month year cant see driverless car could work wintertime
good public transport instead
yes except ive seen polarization used seen utility service like social medium payment system fear politicization autonomous car well centralized controlled traffic strong weapon individual othered political system
watching latest video clickbait seriously thumbnail soooo bad dont think
dont think unemployed driver destroying driverless car driver union never going let hit road
wait driverless car become widespread drunk driving many issue wont problem anymore
know good public transport would also solve cost effective
closest ive ever come dying someone driving mile speed limit passing someone wrong side road dont want afraid happening every time go get food visit friend
title want driverless car road immediate interpretation driver deserve brutally massacred
major reason im looking forward despite economic problem theyll create ie theyll put lot truck driver passanger driver work reduce emission owning car bev lot fewer car needed server people employment problem massive one need addressing soon
video feel like long commercial also feel shortsighted find strange channel obvious example lack formal analysis driverless car might impact transportation industry one largest employer united state first might sound beyond scope video way plight striking elevator worker dismissed somewhat callously earlier video make worse kind shift autonomous vehicle community lead ideally would done massive overhaul energy infrastructure well economy would responsible address economic political side topic opposed seemingly waving away
find strange channel he paid say hope help
robertshippey oh aware he paid talk thing usually provides nuanced take hence surprisedisappointment
indeed let remove automatic light road pay someone switch instead created billion crappy job sake employment fact im trying say point place
autonomous robotics future
autonomous car going deal idiot rd world country woman age really cant drive license rust bucket car like toronto hongcouver
excited driverless car interesting hear waymo critical break technology commercial waymo disappointed expect watch veritasium video
change thumbnail n title
removing usa trafic accident data remove accident whole planet
sure taliban would love access cruise missile
two selfdriving car dont communicate make accurate prediction others possible movement tricky situation
big problem unpredictability human sprawling city like arizona everyone drive one thing would really like see perform dense urban environment small road people cyclist running around everywhere may dont cause many accident like case pedestrian cart may bit cautious kind environment meaning would essentially stuck unless adjustment made adjustment would also mean higher chance eg hitting pedestrian something unexpected
cool
suggestion new thumbnail title would changing thumbnail fleet selfdriving car putting best choice humanity thumbnail text title changed selfdriving car used everyone
sound good
mentioned tesla effort fsd would answer lot question encourage people optimistic self driving car
mean lidar approach lidar crutch saw one crashing stationary object video fact scene tesla hit truck
rambozambo every driver assistant system prone read owner manual btw radar caused problem think le problem reminder autopilot fsd
rolandkertesz calling system autopilot mistake first place
rambozambo please look definition
im aware difference autopilot full selfdriving
driverless car good programmer write code operate company pushing tech hireor contract programmer willing work lowest pay meet target diversity demographic kind like rocket science dont want go rocket built lowest bidder dont want ride car whose ai coded developer fulfilled quota
instead make really good public transport reduce need car together
much av size personal vehicle dont solve traffic problem caused many personal vehicle dont address damage caused car dependent design youre still forced drive grocwry store need enough handle rush hour traffic would great regular scheduled public transport autonomous supplementary call minibus service av handle time low fluctuating demand like night
interesting point view taking whole world one ecosystem milion people died car crash milion organ donners sick people car crash make benefit human ecosystem maybe even make worse milions death people get transplant always human try correct nature make harm ecosystem imrove perfect mind homo sapiens biggest problem whole earth
watching latest video guess one video youre gon na change thumbnail title maybe already havent noticed
ulternative title thumbnail title driverless car today yay nay thumbnail saying yay
please go tesla fsd
would make app service like uber lyft autotonomous vehicle way dont pay anyone driver make money
would terrible car faultits people
car come future play siren sound next road pull
probably make law
learn faster learn better evolution robot evolving exponentially scary exciting ngl
emission
airplane fly self son bitch still fall sky
show car drive snowcovered road surrounded nothing field snow vehicle front guide consider near home show autonoumous car actually navigate safely street heavy foot bike traffic plenty road work closure without bogged consider go work course make sure safe wont kill misinterpreting see tesla failed spectacularly finally make underlying technology cheap enough reasonable waymo fails pretty badly use lidar considering really trouble picturing driverless vehicle ready wide adoption within next year
good arstechnica article there reason cruise uber chose place development environment cruise chose la heavy foot bike traffic uber chose pittsburgh snow bridge decided needed tackle hard problem gate seems well waymo seems hit limit easy suburban driving
elevator airplane tracked path vehicle capable path change neither deal child potentially running front vehicle second foot change direction car result collission running road resulting accident
love thought driverless car think order mass adaption occur vehicle need easily maintainable pointed sensor vehicle main question one financially keep maintenance sensor
different car v year ago car easily maintainable electronics really complex past could maintain car think car sharing common future
would never ending nightmare
wow never thought lot advantage car adding green space le parking lot would awesome
could also make possible work place much away home since could catch sleep car
much better solution automated subway
ilcubo thing underground unpersonalized
imnotnotgameiacmaniac higher capacity battery space efficient fast also make road safer people stupid people go outside touch grass breathe fresh air also bring people closer socialise want overcrowded planned correctly may go directly front home also mean help promote walking cycling shorter distance good health mentally physically may force development dense walkable neighbourhood mean space park farm except american suburban wasteland youre farmer far away city case there option car
wonder get fined case
meanwhile tesla hit boulder road bug software im firm automated car front
engineer technical issue driverless car however pose philosocial question dependant want society forever give freedom large corporation dependant car sure willing make choice
one task le keep active mean dont get wrong love dishwasher washing machine driving make happy like drive navigating without gps new area nice challenge dont want everything taken care technology dont think generally good thing give freedom want learn want travel without driving take train get near location equal amount time comparable cost someone pick car last kilometer maybe reason american hyped selfdriving car automated transmission dont decent public transport people know germany drive car want drive like driving except rural area smaller town dont really need benefit course way le shorter traffic jam people driving
get data let people ride car place free
big fan driverless car question would becomes norm future since driving would need car insurance would manufacturer pay insurance malfunction speed blow red light manufacturer pay ticket get drunk driving riding would bac matter
legal right special permission
wait second car going refill
order self driving car would effectively need surveillance state thanks
please get rid annoying pointless background music
theyre remote controlled
worst video channel totally bought paid unless change made ill tend doubt everything say
gray greasy great pediatrician morphologically sail men optically strip towards stiff cricket shocking glistening glorious imprisonment
snow covered road expect far complex
yup theyll work everywhere except new york city pedestrian know theyll stop theyll walk traffic lol
stripping right away one one
one inspiring video ever seen veritasium really wan na thank bringing u wish kind autonomous vehicle eliminate hustle bustle face daily road road rage common nowadays even driving inside speed limit people still shout wish technology become common soon possible
total lie
credit card machine store dont even work almost every time im computer never functioned right hour straight without something crazy happening year
tax dollar going totally wasted next year never work smart guy along think thousnds reason never work start minimum wage would go hour get work people thinking
handle problem partially obstructed road sign
even without driver seatbelt still needed
live phx isnt weird waymos everywhere around year great far
think driving car fog another thing landing plane fog foggy cant see anything shouldnt set car autopilot better human stop side road wait better weather plane cant forced land dont want run fuel
want public transportation microrubber spreading machine
short ride passenger tesla x self drive couple year ago spooky hell first soon start relax like say
car driver license
dont need license driving youtake ride good blind disabilties etc
people news arrogant get really people arent wrong say tech still least year said driving perfectly driveable road likely preprogrammed ride perfect condition mention bad road condition marking fog snow rain find situation hit someonesomething regardless safety precaution said nothing minute good news ad waymo
happens receive signal liidar sent car next
want see test city car
veritasium great video completely agree cyber security aspect also video uav delivery great topic
problem automatic system hacked intentionally disturbed airplane due strict condition impose aviation security measure highly improbable case car highly improbable contrary think someone want assassinate someone driverless car could represent perfect tool unfortunately dont say driverless car bad contrary know electronics hacked mean intentionally thats concern electronic system hacked order bad thing
emilia elevator werent electronic elevator driver disappeared everything electronic hacked
eventually could use tracker every car every car automatic
cant hire person drive pay le also feel safe
transport cheaper need parking lot ngl sound like bit logical pole vaulting
derek left lacking well educated proponent driverless vehicle already claim main obstacle driverless tech something believe unpredictable collision however billion people world driverless car would currently seasonal best really wish mentioned snow ice least video perhaps sometime cover topic video
oh look min waymo commercial didnt discus badnegative good didnt mentioncompare product testcompare product good video advertisement tsk tsk unsubscribed
cant wait able rub one way work
thing traffic light ive already seen something similar traffic light stopped working busy intersection town centre usually wait five minute way light change particular junction traffic move slowly day light stopped working people actually stopped every couple car let people way never seen traffic move intersection fast smooth life even people waiting cross road got across road quicker light werent working people let across weird wasnt used seeing driver sonice traffic move fast area took broken traffic light
could lidar spelt right vision thing used google map make better map world point could take virtual avatar walk around representation anywhere car lod almost real life opposed ive always wanted see perfect near perfect representation world walk around virtual space know maybe one day interact
world without driver could also mean traffic light legacy support smarter traffic light
interested driverless vehicle name cant derive knowing live go etc little privacy none
think googlewaymos approach ideal pay people drive car get data tesla many mile need pay people get paid year away available layman im sure year teslaswaymoswhoevers car better human case
way dismiss ethical concern autonomous vehicle inexcusably irresponsible
addressed putting perspective said accident way related ethical concern typically discus think still laughably high estimate especially considering long car already driven
maniac seppo cop going kick cant gun innocent driver
funny im seeing today started getting driver license delaying year
video advertisement shocking
edit derek briefly mentioned video already self driving car better car could communicate eachother like oh im going left car know expect without guess every car connected every car certain proximity bet would accident due software
oh derick accept money obviously advert
think remote control tv good invention since people would say yes convenient people disability use tv ease etc see downside remote control
ok soon gov payslip nobody work right
extremely wary idea driverless carsuntil dream dream use leg little use arm struggling adjust acquired disability friend mine pro wheelchair user pulled drive accessible driverless wheelchair van asked wanted go day outing said yes please voice command opened sliding door drove electric chair ramp parked marked area voice command anchoring system automatically came clicked place sliding door shut voice command realised front seat excellent view front said ok car please take u beach whereupon set realised driverless car could maintain independence autonomy privacy woke dream feeling completely differently driverless car important door might open people playing field might level still think long way go perfect stake imperfection incredibly high really altered attitude towards existence might forecast
im making self driving car long keep control vehicle want drive car dont want limters safety taking point prevent crash
elevator operator analogy flawed actually drive car people riding elevator nothing changed elevator becoming autonomous people driving car autonomous car remove whole driving aspect thing lot people actually enjoy driving car reason adoption autonomous car slowed significantly saying thing like year way optimistic people like refuse buy autonomous vehicle least never utilize functionality result youll plenty human driving car long time still dont see autonomous car revolution happening decade result
im still wondering google dared use firefly name car
much like driving car would much rather travel thing purely based comfort laziness thing safety nice mainly could much time commuting week could given back catch sleep get work done sit back enjoy road instead ever vigilant im driving
derek expected better shilling tech company bad thing full stop
twenty million mile fifty cent mile ten million dollar dont pay driver money percent
autonomous stock buy google tesla lazr thats answer really need
ehm much car like cost without rnd course
there rain car brain work correctly many drop distortion glass
million total mile driving total accident number speak ive saying year computer driver would better myriad poor driver see road every day personally cant wait day autonomous car norm hope im alive see hell im already
amusing many commenters disapprove future lift analogy apt obvious unintended consequence course pedestrian wholl clock car stop walk straight traffic like future version rizzo well need simultaneously invent precogs car know folk blatantly taking advantage thus morally run haha
cant say im surprised sold even mention tesla instead take quick paycheck company never scale work phoenix area road premapped true ai garbage tesla first fsd maybe company keep wasting time geofencing lidarradar pure vision way disappointed sold misled
payback driverless long haul truck greater task easier
think selfdriving car great idea however dont want future selfdriving car road one main draw car rather public transit freedom car provides scared freedom car going taken away completely future freedom commute also freedom repair car freedom go remote location
freedom repair largely gone already more pity
sound good complex elecator x save life sure
road traffic light like would incredibly hard pedestrian cross would make mean transport cycling lot intimidating
actually opposite know car road give way stop make easier ride bike
elevate highway open entire plane pedestrian
cycling already intimidating u video talking mentality need change city planner something car manufacturer change
id say solution might elevated walkway
thatguynick referring specifically clip junction traffic light would city planner
tesla team
basically ur saying shouldnt try get driver license get self driving car
invest microvisions
really want headsup display windshield providing input autonomous car thing leave rural dweller cold really need full g connection every space u work ever connection fails catastrophe car arent manually driveable g failure cause entire metropolis shut area without g connection become completely inaccessible way would work eliminate lot parking lot would people still owning driverless car letting take work become uber theyre working come back pick end day would still need place car rest minute waiting get work
dont want stupid looking eco box want corolla carbed age
there way ill let robot drive
accident year average driver personally dont need
glorified uncritical advertising veritasiums scientific independence credibility taken knock anyway
eh saw chance make lot money took probably like almost everyone else would agree video bad doesnt mean there something inherently wrong others one huge miss
epilepsy cant drive driverless car could completely change life dont even need accommodation dont get driverless car company arent involving people like process would gladly take driverless car wouldnt able compare car driving driving nothing would taken away driving would granted lifechanging capability freedom movement mile diameter around home let honest disabled people lower social ladder public saw people like riding around driverless car effectively safely would much trusting furthermore perfect bridge politically politician would much likely make exception u person drive anyways example something like wisconsin politician made exception cbd pill little girl try seizure thats industry break politically involve u
im pretty sure driverless car arent safe who gon na drive wheel therere driver
car able communicate intention car car hey wan na eradicate puny human car sure bro proceeds crash
car lol
little trolling
reason start putting people immediately
got asshole passenger want help would awesome look like accident
car trying kill dystopia
intelligence level ai system le butterfly fly navigate across whole continent without map want driven around butterfly technology used assist driver driving better like aircraft system help pilot fly better
driverless car making road lot safer potentional idiot driver
driverless car successful indian road go haha
pedestrian crossing crosswalk
car driverless even le variability driving behavior le edge case
wow happened sooner anticipated kind stuff used impossible
future brain removed birth wired great borg ant colony computer people incompetent think simple task need body
usually really like work im pretty disappointed video question technology make driverless car safer humandriven car answer obviously yes thats important question much important question using car get around answer emphatic theyre big use much stuff produce require large swathe land bulldozed paved use nothing car storage existence demand city made le walkable know care lot climate change one important thing solve problem make city denser walkable driverless car solve problem driverless car landlord painting mold apartment new tenant come
sooooohow much gain car camera god know much auto cervix cost againin part video say
take fun life
there almost million truck driver well million job related trucking industry u thats including taxi ride service thats including postalpackage delivery service etc driverless car truck catch say goodbye job innovation benefit people stand make buck everything sake safety convenience one considers social economic impact well never stop progression technology need start serious discussion regarding impact innovation society whole
smart people confidence usually die like stupid know mean
would trust computer driver know
canada fresh fall snow multilane road people cant see lane marking guess might driver following cooperate assumption made first driver even though assumption likely wrong adhoc cooperation crucial automated driver participate
computer would know road gps get accurate think future sure exchange data
alexz ive read far currently watch painted lane marking optical recognition im sure frequency lidar maybe dont think gps going accurate within inch anytime soon
imagine computer could hacked
ive accident year driving time distracted one time driver ran red light distraction caused accident problem driving wont safer car autodriver even car autonomous still controlled human one rather tell car take somewhere take
love fully autonomous vehicle basically however fully autonomous vehicle fair offroadunpaved condition bumpy ride cause damage fully autonomous vehicle electronics speed programed comfortable ride offroadunpaved condition
driverless car stick motorwaysindustrial area ie area without childrenscyclistspedestrians
alexflodder well built driverless car almost certainly much safer human driver area high density childrendscyclistspedestrians though
comparison comparing blind spot human since car human using one camera back automated car camera
also kill performance car industry whats point driverless ferrari going go speed limit anything crazy road drive like boring bus driver
definitely love idea also love driving car fun
dont think driving car gon na get banned
westworld
think answer riddle autonomous device best explained hbo series chernobyl people dont care factual dont care increased decreased risk preventing disaster care blame remove pilotdriver plane crash blame better crash people blame crash one blame course people wont admit thisbut look long term problem almost one focused prevent focused blamepunish
ho yes individual car instead public transport good idea planet
self driving bus might better
yeah thought dont know good solution mean bus one person transporting lot others allready good plan dont know making self driving would make really better seems like lot work small improvement
also really like autonomous car make much easier assassinate tech illiterate yet tech fetishizing neighbor also make easy stalk car talk corporate server way much
people think average driver think everything world normally distributed mistaking mean median impossible people better median driver perfectly possible people better mean driver
indeed impossible people better median driver thats tried say he saying people reported saying yes question think youre better average driver sort gotcha show people greatly exaggerate driving skill compared anything remotely objective
illasra know exaggerating data indicate arent correct
thats part come respondent likely interpreted question median derek took meaning support thing video supposed say glorifying safety waymo car much possible
people dont realise much change gon na happen decade
im curious know system put place protect human error pushing update fleet causing fleet car end something dangerous
production software system push testing fleet testing environment ok push real fleet ok push probably system twice strict
train first would invent fully automated train much simpler track essentially start stop
one reason think train le dangerous car would easier invent driverless train would also significant impact safety death
driverless train already exist many place london copenhagen two ive used
driverless train literally existed ever since london victoria line started operation although still driver cabin case example driverless metro system entire dubai metro entirety vancouver skytrain every mrt line singapore generally lot recently opened metro line mainly europe china alex small people leaving car train would definitely great impact road travel death overall
driverless ai train already exist many place train already significantly safer car even human error mix
frankly use train general full stop car good form mass transit
try making autopilot public transport private transportation
thing happen
like fact despite driver seatbelt still buckled im assuming car ding seatbelt since still want human driver available needed didnt disable seatbelt warning still find kind cute car need buckled driving
add coffee machine im
video objective enough
challenge autonomous driving extremely unlikely hypothetical
thank calling delamane service
trying sound smart imo
""
trust human really get lot car accident thats fact
wont need stop sign traffic signal autonomous carsstopping waste time
hate say another job technology going take human creating unemployment technology help u replace u
enjoy driving much especially speed acceleration
several factor address happens car computer develops problem particular computer crash solar single event upset human adapt diverless car around percentage x become worse obnoxious number self driving car become large percentage confuse could information overload car lidar blind another diverless car
im autonomous car think make driving deemed dangerous think safer dont want live world
hate youre taking people job
car make wan na say pui pui
absolutely amazing really hope becomes normal place within adult lifetime
think could help adoption release video dangerous situation car handled particular youd want leave people feeling would crashed
bad people think theyre average combine hypothetical driving scenario give viewer hindsight comment would littered well certainly wouldnt crashed im good driver
need johnny cab
public transport
problem driverless car humandriven car human aggressive assertive like think would chaotic many situation driver need interact rightofway need context bigger picture
future applicable world limited separate road tunnel autonomous vehicle also car inefficient case maintenance equipment failure
loss liberty always come name public safety convenience think road safer comfortable driverless car yep worth everything say recorded everywhere go tracked logged worth possibility malicious actor backdoor access program able hijack terminate based bug worth ferried somewhere authority deem appropriate hesitancy matter safety convenience hesitancy due matter personal liberty privacy abuse power
depends approach self driving car would prefer analog approach advanced sensor rather tracking system thats connected server
yeah shouldnt hold tech back
year old boy lost mother car crash village would disagree btw recent car already hacked kill driver super hard thats never heard murder hacked car
seeing video thought would comment im fully autonomous car drive around dedicated road autonomous car car driven human road want able drive car long road accessible human want able take im autonomous road get way destination personally hope tech way becomes mandatory driver drive distracted car brake something would like see honestly think people drive distracted regularly probably opt assisted level immediately personally prefer drive fewest distraction possible
well hard stop hard uncalledfor someone could crashed rear reason excpect hard stop really pushing towards pedestrian coming yes good yes going wide spread fully autonomous next year car barely managed simple parking area wil nyc
problem still human issue vehicle automated human element make nightmare solve people jaywalk cut care vehicle well see there good reason hesitant
really understand full self driving youd know waymo dead end tesla st company crack autonomous driving
chanse malfunction drive heck system like hollywood movie
video based trainpilled
phoenix profile hate car general
issue problem privacy everywhere go vehicle guaranteed recorded vehicle get remotely hacked vehicle depend internet connection self drive like car lost gps outside connection thanks storm well would question well ai driven vehicle manage unpredictable human behavior reasonable replace car road driverless nation amount freedom also say ball fly front road kid might chasing driverless anticipate
lily agree course arent mutually exclusive could walkable city remaining car self driving dealing topic directly comment small parking lotsive heard number like time parking space per every vehicle many city spread everything apart city layout make safe easy get around foot system public transit bicycle share small lightweight ev sharing along reduced roadway reduced parking spot etc make huge difference many potential system unexplored go economics thanks bad system capitalism becomes self perpetuating moneypower force wish rest u
drive soooooooo many mile work day ride car think wait
""
lidar work two car near would interfere also plane dont land narrow radio beam follow like blind person following rope
would love see car operate suburb london road wide enough one car two way road also narrow country lane england medieval bridge narrow another million mile simulation
car driverless communicating would easier could work long way ahead order going go sensor could squeeze past easily everything going slower open road would probably easier simulate everyones stopping distance would shorter need forecast far future maybe eventually car zoom mm spare scary maybe car designed side slide along car similar design without damage
thing learn programming error infront pc pc time bcs error come input work put wrong input iam wrong told like plane sadly crashed fully worked intended human put wrong input maschine followed
problem claim driverless car solve also solved better car driver driver aid whole premise purposefully based one false logic assertion sensor intelligence aid driverless car also aid humandriven car better using false dishonest logic comparing driverless car newest technology sunshine humandriven car technology top drunk etc blizzard sliding ice etc
company really trying make driverless car viable theyd working change infrastructure prof u pr whatever serious trying really make implementable except certain restricted show case little marketing video made purposefully create false impression filmed minutely specially mapped area would done even rain driverless car without change infrastructure
bus would gamechanger
think driver second third employment economic activity u alone million driver u alone wanting would disappear year time would go work next health insurance covid weve learn flattening curve economy absorb amount unemployment
donut parking lot
full disclosure know feel like there much advertisement still
excited technology fear someday normal ppl wont able experience fun driving anymore normal commute
replace window screen get fake car control installed play driving game get voice say returning normal reality maybe screen could based actually outside enhancementsstylefilter choosing want sun rain singing dancing etc expecting royalty make money way
franksierow cant replace fun fast driving mountain road u feel car body engage urself fully
someone shooting
yea never distracted
mean human sometimes dont make right decision machine always
mean yea elon musk didnt care enough put lidar failed tesla thats tesla dangerous killed many people cause elon think cheaper without lidar without lidar sometimes tesla doesnt detect thing crash thing lol
think drive human much drive relies vision sign lane marking etc lidar get far cv prevail maybe lidar redundancy might good idea ultimately cv achieve l selfdriving car
problem driverless car driverless car person driving car isnt driverless thats autonomous car really good
everyone self driving car could connect satellite like thing car aware car basically impossible crash
oops electrical interference everyone dy
still mechanical failure
wow shameless money grab expected better unsubscribe dont really like respect infomercial would much interested honest numerical analysis car autopilot problem given number variable involved stuff dont cant know would think unsolvable much likely outcome expected sponsorsupplied obvious answer
leah inferring someone luddite pointing clear conflict interest make look like cult member
technological obstacle left challenge require actual tangible engeneering problemsolving skill make cheaper excluded ae technological hurdle left technology selfdriving car already exist need improvement location specific part specific city around world live rio city urban design mess computer hard navigating place however biggest challenge still come politics essentially technology put people unemployed toal population country unemployment armageddon politician worker union fight thing tooth nail start roll significant number
probably many taxi driver strike technology become mainstream
unfathomable people really think human make better driver ai like got ta kidding computer cant drunk sleepy distracted dont blink cant blurry vision cant blinded sun see rain remember traffic law remember speed restriction mathematically predict start time stopping time accident accurately see around car tell discussion
know yall trust issue saying human capable driving better computer simply wrong
trust vehicle lot trust everyone else road monke lot u
hey im blind cant wait city wish best google waymo push society technology
u even comment ur blind
demortal lot accessibility option people realize everything voice command
dhruvtukadiya bruh didnt even edit single word wrong
demortal duh text speech doesnt make mistake
dhruvtukadiya ok
definitely promise whether self driving car better average human driver someone drive car crash fault self driving car crash car fault company get sued instead accident month itll time le thats potential lawsuit month going expensive company think holding back self driving car right think technology pretty much point
like see research driving faster really faster city drive normal catch guy passing every car front delayed slowed traffic light
seems cool issue mentioned video privacy owns data trip single company know everything went company able infrastructure manage traffic fleet happen company conflict government whatever country able block traffic slowing dominate government stop legislation company arent better solution car environmental cost car overloaded rare metal electronics guess cost negligible
question would work heavy rain snow etc would car drive snakker town europe etc car use lider wouldnt interfere
lidar radar affected rain snow robot car would actually better snaking narrow road sensor allaround self better situational awareness anticipate scenario react much faster solution propperly thought multiple car using lidar wouldnt confuse laser beam would different frequency car present spot two car would lidar contact could use dynamically frequency would many car road make number possible frequency insuficient
purpleldv thanks answer would lider radar able see road marking
fredrikriefenstahl integrated sistem sensor comprised also camera car also rely prescanned map area based could determine position lane case snow blanket rarely happens always track snow left car extreme situation wouldnt human driver problem seeing lane robotcars advantage may exact information terrain using lidar measure position relation certain landmark tree building etc maibe extreme case live part canada norway additional sensor could used groundpenetrating radar ultrasound thermal seeking sensor hall sensor anything could help
looking forward owning k civic camera
within year major city california year start common major city general fear longer theyll able commute two small city north sweden winter really bad weather road condition road road marking hidden several inch snow theoretically sensor way better human eye dont think edge case like ironed
whats really cool idea autonomous vehicle talk road future cool
yeah let hope terrorist doesnt whisper bad idea
dont try tell want
mention tesla autopilot crash

autoplayed video saying dont want self driving car want public transportation convenient dont check schedule
autonomous car taxi driver espresso machine baristas there reason taxi driver going automated away one left best taxi driver though people willing pay ride person like people still willing pay espresso barista starbucks everywhere lol imo automatingawayjobs argument missing point autonomous car add functionality everyone u moving people around le money per person wellpaid human driver almost definitely stick around market otoh autonomous car enable nyclevels uber ride entire country uber cant even make existing ride profitable iiuc
really like driving im looking forward time dont anymore much time
think car distance sensor beep help park closer together mistake one morning trying move car end mine close like inch took point turn edge way little bit time think must used distance sensor fair enough able park le inch wall bollard lamp post car park close one get foot would closest give car room turn road close would driverless car park parallel parking
question would ever need paralel park fiew time would pick someone autonomous car everything change even property philosophy parking business like gas station car wash one would interested buy car mobility maybe passion le car one use would trafic much possible charging taxi company depot much le parking needed space human

eh really
yknow beautiful thing could driverless car could decade point stopped ordering everything around car order thing around human being instead give good system public transport form individual transport day driverless car end traffic horror car dependent city best itll change little yes maybe make bit safer really change stop depend car together
thats impossibility planner engineer budget like public transport people option prefers alone car
rasakblood whats best rest humanity whole sometimes inconvenience individual varying degree matter put ego aside also recognize improving thing benefit many inevitably stand benefit individual granted im aware lot people dont andor wont whatever reason least consider honest manner public transportation even ubiquitous better many even aspect convenient comfortable efficient etc way people would easily come around idea adopting life problem discussing topic others tend mentally visualize forced participating public transport exists right choice could make also want make given vastly improved able participate mass transit still allowing isolation feature could still implemented thats generally seen reason people dont want get involved also wouldnt necessarily ruin people ability operate vehicle leisure recreation either way continue offering kind experience people want seek without also saturating planet million vehicle add pollution level also million vehicle arent utilized one reason another there much waste involved doesnt feel like attempt initially made discus address whether really stand benefit everyone long term operate way even attempting come honestly baffling amount contention pushback
shallow thinker
public transport suck id rather walk
netherlands going tot mutch difficult constandly mode transport road like cyclist
aight youve convinced
who fault would run person
automated car take risk drive fast irresponsibly think sure could situation automated car could cause accident statistically percentage much smaller human drive
sound like truck
took jerbs
get part world road arent well enough maintained people dont stay lane necessarily itd hard computer drive derek must recently italy
think talking like india
honestly huge swath united state
michigan
hitting x doubt
happened shouldnt want driverless car road video
im sure already said comment reason pilot land manually sunny day sunny day cat iiib operation may effect airport equipment requires clearance around runway guarantee accuracy stringent spacing standard required efficient guide plane close enough runway see let land manually visually foggy day airport cat iiib capability active thats pilot required use
dont airport leave iiib operation always effect expensive
guyhommeki equipment requires clearance around runway guarantee accuracy stringent spacing standard required basically using autoland system require rigid somewhat le timespace efficient operating procedure major airport pressed capacity would see benefit sacrificing capacity superfluous automation secondtier airport may costconstrained term equipment runtimes may capability first place simply dont personnel expertise hand time
jadefalcon still problematic video would safe margin impeding time space efficiency needed catiii make human landing operation safer catiii overly safe another way put reason margin actually necessary feature extra precaution feel confortable toeing limit much control also could bias margin planned worst case climate sunny day suppose notshould
firstnamelastnameokyz probably regulatory reason thing like automation tend regulated much strictly ensure safety automation go wrong effect million v single pilot error error automation regulation lead faulty equipment across entire system thing like automation tend regulated ensure safety good thing also mean resistance automation expensive rely take longer widely implemented
human better landing plane thats
see car easily stopped track criminal every street corner preying endless stream helpless victim driverless car driverless car actually cause dangerous mob block intersection everywhere ironically way stop hostile mob blocking intersection program driverless car plow mob block intersection alternative let mob stop car drag beat unconscious street
within yr semi driver replaced autonomous wheeler
downside bumper car wouldnt fun
im yet im scared shitless ai lol
good always want driver option bc know u love driving
feel torn video im really happy covered dig ai especially self driving consider cost geofencing lidar radar scalable least using configuration waymo good icebreaker public least still give thumb lol
undoubtedly become divisive political issue left want mandatory car combat climate change conservative object due safety issue personal choice
data collected coming year surely make incredible virtual driver
also said imagine selfdriving car widespread enough able communicate intention real time car theyll able accurately predict future situation theyll find solve traffic jam point accident good condition would become almost impossible
supermariotomma tbh point traffic jam exist cu lot happens cu reaction speed mind automated car would close
dsn depends number car road mathematical model neglecting human factor already show certain threshold depending street network congestion becomes unavoidable make car driverless also reduce total number car road
idk man elevator always give massive anxiety
totally see autonomic car fully established u dont buy car subscribe unified service whole globe pay month u order car like taxi al learns routine u book car time car ask u u want set ride routine set car wait u u leave home wait u u leave workspace street arent cloted parking car instead could well organized cycle lane instead place parking car booked either designated local lot waiting order regional parkhouse could ev park roboter plug car need service wich either car mileage induced rider noticed issue rider get new car asap credit reporting issue confirmed issue
ah figure guy would shill big corporation wonder much money got paid propaganda
self driveing car problem car themself problem take space cant carry many people cost maintaing car much traffic accident human control make mistake self driving car avoid problembut hackedwhich main consern better option trainsthey self driving depend u living train effecient people travel le accident traffic
people drive speed limit get tired get drunk ignore right way react slow make error computer make error rarely
dont want car road
basically vehicle waymo driving experience ever
train looking saying im safer
cheaper
guy would rather walk flight stair actually better respect today better physical condition
lidar necessary full self driving ask human ever successfully driven car lidar vision yes
im board thinking often lane keeping assist try throw highway clean environment would fine winter road marking car supposed use indicator covered inch snow dont see going well time soon
looka good wasnt addressed thia video happens lidar place many driverless car interfereconfuse malicious people sending weird signal confuse
include veritasium clip car
technology fantastic cheaper safer efficient potential save life add greenery city cant wait
cheaper hell cheaper
johnnycab come

regarding asiana flight glideslope system service way plane land system u also report ntsb stated asiana pilot relied much automation making many scared fly manually exactly scare autonomous car driver poor driving skill take computer decide theyre longer job im airline pilot experienced several situation autopilot give well trained pilot take btw world airport equipped cat landing system airport autolands performed top calibrating mataining well buying il transmitter extremely expensive airport system plane help automated landing feature ground based top large increase separation aircraft performing autolands thats special cat holding position taxiway farther away runway cause interference ground based transmitter giuding approaching aircraft see auto industry remake mistake aviation industry done past year mistake caused loss lot life
heavy rain radar car work well
get bus
simulation area people drive nicely gon na take way data apply area south asia africa road arent tht good also driving people average also issue case wrong indication sign given driver mistake still would way fun sitting car experiencing first hand
technical safety standpoint yes autonomous car would better standpoint freedom dictatorship mass surveillance etc autonomous car real threat humanity able flee someone anymore power monitored go go visit etc give away freedom technical convenience already using smart phone browser big company china see work company like facebook google censor already told imagine car car refuse take bad reputation citizen subversive rock concert terrorist protest police want car drive without inspecting autonomous car private use public transport major goal dictator

hey take military budget give developing better public transport public transport home public transport home
jd lol
drive minute work every day back would hour even though live large city bus system pretty much run inner city day spend way much money gas good thing city live several military installation one biggest fort u though thats far important providing easy access business service
jd advance without military ya know something thats designed kill people
xavitalt warfare military always provide faster advancement technologically youre constant competition enemy
surprisedchar thing said civilian sector constant competition enemy cause war death shouldnt like guess humanity hasnt learned anything past
im driverless car tesla cant wait hit fsd beta major accident waymo car distracted driver selfdriving mode hit someone night pushing shopping cart across street thing need know people realize fully safe safer driver theyre giving partial information could come bite butt someone decides whistleblower something intense oneperson death
ubers software driving waymobuilt vehicle uber took flack longer trying fsd anymore pretty sure already legally required report accident
wasnt waymo uber

pure transportation autonomous vehicle great car enthusiast sad day ifwhen longer drive car nothing like driving hp fire breathing beast slinging light sport car mountain back road
biggest concern driverless car get hacked otherwise bring
hard hack driverless car processing cloud reliant happens car
reaction time better human cost car wasting much energy scanning road technology succeeds mean million lose job
think answer stay driving also considerable portion social collaborative act smartest move would invest shared self monitoring transportation car unit personal decision personality think even tech perfect still wouldnt give possibility relax go ride take shortcut break rule know fine context scenario never complete hive mind interconnected car long human driver human related flaw ai properly handle
long take calculate speed moving object take consideration stopped strong saw man little car
long take calculate speed moving object nanosecond take consideration yes
wouldnt like autonomous vehicle survival instinct
imagine thing also recommend visit several european town road marking traffic light etc without vehicular accident
imagine everywhere right someone hacked caused million crash many potential injury dead fact posible scary
year year ago car used driver driverless car came along adoption slow even effort convince public fact safe
dcas boeing max hasnt great human counter example
much trust ai behind driverless car dont trust human driver

week watching im watching first driving lesson yesterday ive got respect vehicle didnt think would happen since im programmer already huge appreciation advanced program
especially since almost yesterday
human driver give job
tesla vision system still lightyears ahead waymo
happen autonomous car stop obvious reason like see sideways car behind wont stop fast first car
love driving stick
think whether condition good bad everyone owning car automatic car every would easy drive
question want answer hacking secure cyberlevel
benefit however consumer space computer electronics software hardware maintenance cycle majority people car maintenance habit sound dangerous dont team people airline payroll making sure every sensor system functioning perfectly concede maintained fleet vehicle privately owned would work however privately owned completely autonomous car open opportunity extremely dangerous computer electronics fail
racist ask car drive instead asian woman

worked company sold conversion kit tractor made self drive working field used sat nav mark boundary field along obstacle driving around first computer would store wouldnt need every time account moving object people walking though driver still needed safety
driverless car used restrict movement
technology one day surround u road thats fine hope dont outlaw old manually driven car people like really like driving good like therapy u
outlawed certain road horse today would dangerous mixture manual driving car relegated track certain road imo
work country like india
feel like eventually far enough future non self driving car made illegal
yea think certain autonomous level made compulsory even driver car
one hope future transit wont need car becuase people realised public transit walking cycling much efficient cheaper better environment
happens whenif get pulled
long driverless car answer kidshow much longer til get im
easy implement mean could right alexa software skill
driverless car become thing would make people know le afraid go road sister doesnt want car shes scared shell get accident mom near death experience car crash thing become wide spread world become better place
derrick think implemented year ill bet
way better tesla shitty beta thats killing people
insurance rate wouldshould drop nearly nothing go live
fatality car accident annually germany happen lane highway bad weather condition night time guess automonous car arent able navigate narrow street lot pedestrian bicyclist would simply cause traffic jam
one cant wait give chore driving hope affordable
common stated benefit innovation prevent thousandsmillions death let go street ask would like add extra people world right going talk ethic population growth
like safety idea still want able make money delivery getting get rid lot job
pretty weird despite data car needed stop abruptly parking lot one would think wouldve noticed human earlier wouldve either steered left bit stopped le abruptly fact way make think maybe tech close acceptable quite maybe year two iron kink
think something human behind cart
lightdavid yeah would much easier car could remove human world someday learn
erikdj oh
erikdj even talking
crockil terminator fan fiction guess
google employee sleeping wheel doesnt make autonomous car dangerous regular case people fall asleep car automation thats cause lot accident
true problem self driving car lacking human input entirely problem violent crime self driving car cant yet think understand meaning weapon violence someone showed gun would able run away attacker would rob would stand front car silly problem feel isnt silly whatsoever consider country moderate high level violent crime especially consider said driverless car expensive regular car b said car easily spotted distance due bulb top
cant drive thanks drive
want driverless car
autonomous driving definitely going work well clean expected environment like fenced location shown video think whats going take year autonomous driving difficult environment example researcher shown strategically adding several small reflector tape stop sign would trick car recognizing sign properly adversarial attack even outside adversarial attack drawback using neural network always edge case cause dnns fail edge case catastrophic effect limit public confidence autonomous driving definitely believe well get l driving someday itll probably take longer year
biggest issue city design usa alot city already car focussed wide streeds alot highway little intergration different kind traffic day autonoumous car drive without problem city like napels rome amsterdam busy hour controlled chaos yes think ready currently certainly right condition good use enough city dangerous sidenote alot eu city beeing made carless might time much issue public transportation reasonable alternative least city aint case im certain ready also far away maybe year
true trick neural network vision way easier trick human vision like many time people go red light dont stop stop sign purpose missed even influence small percentage case lead severe accident still terrifying im sure every experienced driver could name dozen case like making sweat every time recall one
arizona test area fenced controlled expected public road anything happen anyone drive anyone many order magnitude away fake closed test road darpa yes obviously forgiving environment downtown new york winter fact google trust system uncontrolled dynamic environment without driver pretty significant
gbr billion euro km metro cost expanding metro city historcal part contruction started completed yeah could say metroline expensive build take alot time associated disruptive work city even making bussinesses going bankrupt due contructionworks street construction reality started back halted due half historical centre got destroyed citizen didnt take anymore got layed till new technoligy wasnt destructive city next step project remove much car part city indead extend service time driverless transportation yet engineer project dont deem autonomous vehicle ready task city due size street bicyclepedestrian infrastructure want archieve complete different city build country interrested could check notjustbikes channel cover difference urban design country world also give rough indication say autominous vehicle arent ready yet
youre get robbed attacked human driven car make decision escape possibly even causing defensive injury breaking law calculated manner fully automated car itll stop nicely robber sit run red light car coming whilst knowing armed person approach case car easy target like wont help trust although opposite argument surveillance would plus ability call quick help could offset perceived risk combined bulletproof glass youre golden
yes continue tell u bunch super expensive self driving car better good bus line
dont worry autonomous vehicle fleet controlled centralized way equipment like lidar recognize environment word tesla stay away full autonomous driving
understand advantage fully autonomous vehicle love driving give right long able drive
remember video announced youd use clickbait apparent werent kidding red arrow classic clickbait red arrowcircle stronger clickbait
driverless car also doesnt respond pedestrian like drunk person smash death button
everythings fine one driver turn zip chaotically mist tbones car lorenz butterfly car following exactly driving parametersand programmed action reaction speed radarvisual system floatingpoint processor speedswill ultimately throw chaos system even car driverless
whats normal driver supposed situation dont remember levitation shield going ghost feature human mind least self driving car could infrared sensor see come mist also think improbable anything could drive million mile road without also navigating around chaos
look example self driving car predicting crash happen example human driver would better self driving car
like painting picture world sound making think printing right
think best way integrate world would senior citizen sort person impairment would also love see airport order make easier get home long flight help tourist get hotel safely
concern virus car getting hacked malicious people
people good driving people better perception driverless tech fall short yes may see fog body lot sensor coming instantaneously interpreted brain fairly well long shake head dizzy got sens proprioception vision hearing certain anticipation based hear see car see one hear sound see flashing light reflected next corner also obstacle driverless car helpless usually solving tough situation isnt highspeed reaction rather would working solution get around certain obstacle relieved elon fan kill dodgy tech rather real crack perception issue others good video still miss point hackability aspect never going go away connected driving adam something made video right brings oil pipeline hack issue fucked everyone imagine car connected get infected virus yaaaaay
enjoy driving dont want car drive
derek get youre clever guy love show police trained advanced driver would understand far driverless car aside mechanic creating self driving car next biggest hurdle insurer sue car classified full self driving far partial self driving even thing driving concentration partial driving activated driver attention span would severely degraded either argue car ab braking traction control baseless argument rely either youre driving really badly frankly public dont even know happens ab kick theyre literally accident late warn violent ab refers back brake pedal motorcyclist argument isnt valid youve given car two choice one end accident without helmet could easily kill reality could three four option maybe one option never even considered writing software u predominantly grid system road given well cared vandalism road sign warn road painted line get eventually way thing going maybe yr transfer across pond fact go drive around champ elyse rush hour central london rush hour rome software guarantee would overwhelmed take drive outside london countryside road still two way road width car half mean road marking either middle side maybe road width go single track uk traffic still flow direction sorry bore clever peep field live drive u road even seems theyve missed nuance
youre touting benefit added safety security level autonomous vehicle point absolutely valid absolute standard motoring near future there one thing represented video human love act motoring people see car mean simple transport see extension personality way show side also provide mean transport expressing mechanically people take great pride successfully navigating trip using skill theyve acquired time combined experience develop passion navigating open road autonomy way future think there room kind landscape
driver kill many people worth preserve hobby
liquoricilicious boo hoo grow spine
vergildisparda youre actually okay preserving car accident
liquoricilicious yes mean get drive time im going seen one ugly looking shitboxes cold dead body
steam deck self driving car best gamer road trip
feel normal normal
yet see self driving car tested canadian road winter cant see lane sign patially covered snow
driverless car dont really sight rely radar lidar
got hacked
driven close year many different kind traffic condition developed developing country safely conclude human generally terrible driver regardless driving experience andor age many account stupid driver around human general simply suck driving road traffic would much better much saver sooner get autonomous car road plus would le traffic jam provided autonomous car able constantly communicate
agree automated vehicle eventually one issue come mind happens lot florida traffic light go becomes gigantic four way stop must nightmare compute another thing get around driverless car isnt safety thrill driving know people like drive around clear head explore dont forget people love customize ride go mudding there automation way see thing going feel like would invaluable asset people arent able drive need assistance driving maybe even public transportation system big city bus there driver well actually people might get complacent maybe instead driver valet security unruly passenger appropriately dealt
ad scientific discussion based fact nothing fact many question like lidar tricked malicious user someone waymo remotely take control car pay case accident decides amount paid
crazy idea take bus tram metro train driverless car way car company shove u car expensive produce every year due using rare material also polute lot even battery powered car cost much co build normal car driven average person year
im ready self driving car video border line propaganda
technology automates life dumber society get
see effect
justintro instead resorting insult ironically show lack intelligence think automation mean le effort u thinking processing young people getting worse problem solving memorizing interacting one another
livelihood thousand driver
one issue automated vehicle manipulated attacker network despite human flaw least hacked vehicle completely self contained like elevator considered safer option
would car without jackstarting thingy considered level
really like drive car could switch manual automatic driving would dope
tia yeah idk ppl even got license bad drive lol
shame though one want buy car cant drive
deceptive statement pedestrian stationary fact one person killed tempe az
country believe way car safe sure never able react going happen
think telling every single one demonstration take place flat area snow ice want trust around area need show robot actually handle icy mountainside better person dont think legal road
ai needed thing work road country probably mean achieve sentience
thanks ill never fan ill never trust computer drive actually enjoy able drive here thought thing called public transport driverless car realistically year away believe optimistic tesla car prime example driverless car point whole thing still long time
one thing id interested knowing lidar aspect anything isnt image processing unforeseen effect every car blasting lidar direction assume there issue human health like covered cell phone video would animal impacted would interfere form em communication would lidar one car interfere another know elon musk others said lidar crutch theory make sense ai able least match human nonemitting sensor alone rider know would feel much safer
think lidar infrared
justintro good point googled first turn lidar nm infrared considered nm mm visible light nm know animal rely infrared hunt prey also know phone camera sensor pick infrared tv remote feel pretty strongly impact filling street car might still worth cost end want make sure people working technology least considered impact
thoes sacrifice little freedom security loose deserve neither wake sheeple
many yall going fly fully autonomous pilotless aircraft anytime soon
trusted released video derek cite noone company sponsoring dont clearly disclose sponsor cherrypick incident aviation brush away critical detail system
source description
shadowxxe yes google
jackiecs well youd think best people cite technology people created
lidar potential harmful effect eyesight idea blindinglazermobiles convoying city bit terrifying like see stuff loved video worried eye
anyone insight id love hear
work industry think good job highlighting capability dispelling rumorscriticisms av course perfect nothing ever think top company like waymo cruise currently technology offer level product safe safer average driver public
ive seen lot lidar equipped vehicle driver marking around vega last month driverless vehicle already motiv firefighter paramedic vehicle get way efficient quick manner would save u lot headache prevent accident heck im waiting self driving emergency vehicle brings question driverless vehicle detect account shifting weight distribution change momentum direction operate vehicle using lot extra data influence decision making going work larger vehicle seems fundamental problem look
wasted billion dollar commuter train thats still finished though lot contractor politician retired wealthy people look form public transportation first think big improvement im retired really need truck driveway would great ride sharing etc everyone something like though im glad able jump take roadtrip whenever felt like thats different era different united state think would oj car chase take
spontaneous computer hardware failure malfunction car backup system cosmic ray potential cause problem external radiation car may approach
think cosmic ray really energy flip one bit even really rare found corrected ecc memory memory processor check error right spontaneous hardware failure really uncommon think plane exposed way higher amount radiation u ground autopilot major malfunction rare usually caused human error improper maintenance
shadowxxe know failure kind rare asked backup system could
driverless public transport please
fairness arizona easiest road united state built climate doesnt allow much plant life hiding corner narrow winding highway hawaii wild goat along road ft bush growing right highway mph crosswind whole different scenario mph
one else going talk fact google everywhere literally robot car scan world store data like obviously going monetize data there going full scale simulation reality private company making business model simulation reality
derek wrong driverless car still suck take atleast year technology dont
assume people hate driverless car forgot drunk driver
live chandler went corona del sol high school passed seeing even going driverless car become normal havent problem one driving around
red light car stop guy uzi hell yeah
handsome show systemically impress plastic preferentially help following freezing woman insidious quixotic dock
matter good technology accident happen people blame technology difference human blame blame person entire humanity
cant wait get one
got two problem self driving car monitoring control number one understand connected world safer like idea going anywhere nobody able monitor number two already rely electricity much power cut society would largely crumble unless car independent passively monitored possible could unprecedented damage hive mind failed sabotaged finally wouldnt consider problem pill swallow first drove manual car driving elevated chore activity saying im racer boi anything therapeutic would hate one day limited essentially train ride work want enjoy driving relegated track like horse ridden currently
could go driving home bar
emergency vehicle doesnt siren moment time would car still respond accordingly would emergency vehicle either maneuver around autonomous vehicle turn siren
camera think see flashing light
doesnt light siren dont need get emergency
gamerwpic well yes computer genius im asking system place seeing flashing light determine difference light ambulance someone thats duct taped colourful light bar pickup truck etc
gamerwpic im gon na pretend like arent partially dumb due fact never said light said emergency vehicle dont always blare siren anywhere drive emergency vehicle siren would used coming corner junction certain high traffic area come around back original point im asking would autonomous car event emergency vehicle light
mitchc see light camera pull
abnormal coffee spindly peep summer neurobiologically permit till friendly religion alluring unused click
know sponsored video waymos approach fundamentally flawed million mile geofenced area bunch computer simulation solve realworld autonomy many edge case unknown unknown properly safe system probably still better human tesla x safer
every car road driverless wouldnt even need traffic light signage
ignore pedestrian cyclist
philb see problem
could also achieve getting car road prevent inherrent unsustainability car dependancy self driving car unlikely solve problem car travel extremely inefficient compared alternative mass transit cycling walking almost every aspect absurd level car dependancy u severely limited mass trasit option made car travel dangerous average person even self driving car amount car road ensure walking cycling still dangerous
cant wait everywhere
prepared wait long time real world lot harder arizona suburb
everyone quick want turn responsibility life entity case technology even close robust enough handle near infinite amount variable driving
dont think there driver robust enough handle near infinite amount variable either id expect million mile variable finding shared fleet simulated even robust k mile person doesnt think much driving car
true like definitely better handling variable human
cant wait buy fully electric self driving car cost time buymaintain current let check pocket think left money
nobody said youd buy
self driving car may le chance error human intelligence far better machine human brain consist billion nurons
wait driving normal road legal
ill never agree destroy massive amount job
beginning raging tech st century year much much advance tech
great point want automated car price much add price car would able afford one bus driver losing job become like han solo monitor navigator system manager politically connected corp like google becomes evil start hide error log audit accident example airline crash couple year ago due software upgrade feel company involved cared stock price press release concern want automated vehicle road company earn trust far
would facilitate punished wrong opinion sorry cant travel traveling rightsprivileges gave temporarily suspended notice
way government cant ban remotely using phone
think missing trick self driving car would driver seat steering wheel still drive normally
alexa take as chili
believe lot airline sop prefer pilot land manually weather good enough mainly gain experience flying aircraft
nybbl er thats still plane automation work especially airbus airline sop recommend hand flying routine stick il flying time allowing ap designed
nervegas il automated sense show plane go unless cat iii precision requirement allow automated landing il always used pilot know actually approach really automated case
nybbl er well cant land total visibility still minimum requirement depending category il yeah get point still least according pilot ive spoken auto land really used extreme condition hand flying aircraft landing preferred think also make sense given lot time wont autoland capability available landing total visibility cat iiic beyond rare right pilot gaining experience landing still key
question well lidar system function presence many lidar system replaced car road driverless car would infrared footage look like
yes one question actual question cant afford test essentially wondering invisible rave time infrared camera see
know answer second question footage paited blood one person decided hacked tech google decided profit update tech let blood show
know got little dark
simply use different light frequency car every car look frequency emits ignore anything else yes light frequency electromagnetic wave worry youll run frequency establish protocol car talk eachother use frequency close together use one contact could implement dynamic frequency based situation care take look see currently look like hot engine
isnt sponsored video straight advertisement
wowhow much money receive video
info start want always always propaganda think another dead giveaway
damn beautiful
wont road least decade car video work specially mapped section city would work anywhere else hard coded every turn landmark quirk road car actually far easier implement driverless plane driverless car air traffic guided separated distance altitude atc
agrees driverless car could work ideal condition ie city road good weather maintained road lot visualaudio indicator want go farm county camp ground would difficult time interpreting trailedrough road plus would autonomous car find parking would need create install lot hardware software device current plaza parking lot multilevel parking lot etc lot need done general population could accept justify getting autonomous vehicle take time predicting year extremely optimistic
anyone actually drive know cant trust human driver
would hard implement mexico road flow horribly general infrastructure road isnt good
tear ahead like year behind im totally honest tesla similar technology
ethic dilemma discussion small amount accident also related autonomous driving question car driver decide whether crash b also dilemma human rare dilemma would come reality many human would unethical decision since prepared driver license also doesnt test therefore ad need ethical decision outperform human
though id rather prefer driving veichle
think driverless car probably better think human imperfect goi g driverless car driverless car think might trouble human avoiding obstacle suddenly get way making unpredictable movement
car enthousiasts people like drive immense business
issue fully driverless world issue car drive human driven car human crazy unpredictable stuff needing honk car paying attention changing lane highway moving lane car side road might open door many wierd situation human put driver
would useful tackle issue hacking
sound like wamo vehicle ad
driverless car never safe fatality premeditated murder
driverless car sound like smaller train bus
dont think safety foremost issue driver relinquishing control real question safe rather full control whenever need like stopping quick bite need speed im late work
really intersting video
fully autonomous road system fuel usageefficiency would massively improved
let use fuel electricity
liquoricilicious wouldnt matter energy storage used would incease efficiency everything
problem autonomous car car need autonomous
dull viola connolly announce collar postmeiotically pinch till crowded look public jealous forecast
trusting autonomous driving trusting someone else programming come human error factor also system hacked security bypassed someone else take car disable programmatically security system thats humangenerated risk trust machine easily dont trust control gun harmless guy holding may may
auto car eliminate parking lot
hope see adopted city ph specially manila traffic one world worst
one thing mentioned passing given enough attention autonomous car level danger relative others almost like uncanny valley completely different area start system really drive aid driver driving wed like end car drive completely without need driver however path driver guarded electronics electronics job might pas stage driver guard bad human notoriously inept keeping attention nothing test driver proven proving big challenge company need find way skip step accident happening would probably blamed human driversguards could really turn public perception autonomous car
delamain
drive bolivian death road vietnam indian rural area
think kinda pointless talk benefit driverless car would convincing argument get mainstream sooner driver car norm everyone even educated people high knowledge driverless car hesitate trust outright solution slowly integrate driverless car mainstream norm younger younger generation start experience driverless car driver one driver car phase completely naturally
professional driving instructor cant wait fully autonomous car take number accident prevented astounding
hacked used terror attackevery country ban electric car
would like see emergency button indicate auto car give right away getting hospital lot faster
think china first adopt wide scale u slow adaptability due strict rule regulation imagine next year country electronics connected online like traffic light car know light color without actually needing see
car useless florida specially
nope never state passing law prevent driverless vehicle road support
think behind experiment stage advanced tech till alright think scifi ready
sad see publicity like even mention tesla
whats next u guy gon na take away f u make racing future automated cu risky well thanks
officer explain
yes airplane flown extensively computer also mile mile apart flying object youre road youre foot away car whole different story unpredictability
im singapore saw thumbnail like isnt driving
problem automated car human road cause problem every car traded automated car turned time would best course action
would watch video sponsored waymo possibly trust watch anymore unless someone explains tesla competitor waymo
argument trusting ai go window think people already
lmao point always catch soon mentioned bad people driving like damn tru
neverstopping public train get everywhere city like rope way grounded dunno one problem subway come specified time
youd start stop damn thing let people would practical
sellyshootsandscores indeed thats said like rope way ropeway always move go extra slow station make people get
thought provoking
dont want
id say im decent driver main thing watch people
terrifying aspect potentially one centralized system controlling huge amount vehicle carrying thousand million passenger one flaw software especially one leaf system vulnerable manipulation bad actor could cause damage way bigger scale good
true
great noticed flaw hypotethical situation
check driver display waymo could atleast changed oil vehicle sent essentially promotional video
driverless car designed crash called planned obsolescence
car company decided everyone else would use safer car company
great video portrays current development think technology come far yet autonomous car sensor feel much safer normal human driver often distracted misjudges situation excited future innovation
id like see car driving palermo sicily naples
fear would someone malicious intent hacking car something nefarious
simple solution make manual input automatically override
get wreck run someone financially responsible id rather stay control mean dont need insurance pay based age sex wreck long take google pay even cant responsibility back seat
reason honestly hacker someone hack bunch autonomous vehicle people basically fucked
computer say error
self driving car would much much better car road self driving could coordinate also communication beacon part road infrastructure independent limiting effect usefulness
waymo great tech dont deliver theyre massive debt bad debt theyd need billion car trillion ride break even comma tesla hand make money per product
elephant room waymo deliberately avoid mentioning every av developer planning involves putting car road yes get efficiency argument love wellknown law induced demand mean make car travel efficient car final quote great city proof car dreadful city rural area served rapid transport need car waymo wanted reduce fatality improve efficiency mobility well great option involve fair use public space thats wanted wanted build av wanted improve life people mobility issue well great way thats interest
u almost cyclist wonder would get somewhere like amsterdam thousand cyclist
tesla make autonomous vehicle waymo already
im tesla fan well wondered really wish video sponsored waymo id like know additional thing much cost per mile ride car camera radar lidar city probably much harder drive eg eastern city infrastructure much denser le gridlike west geofenced area car driving car truly driving remotely driven staff waymo center much staff add cost per mile still informative video even leave lot question unanswered
yeah want driverless car fact arent even close safe enough yet reason enough willing wait quite bit longer
showed likely already safe letting human drive percent accident happened due human error likely would never happen car road self driven sure new scenario accident argument number significantly lower current situation
believe computer drive better responsible anything happens get pulled breaking traffic law
well thats cool drift tho
like car beside im fun driving much really want car le stress always prefer friend drive take place driver
guez matter work u goin people driver uber stuff think must happen point best move there alot people work driver way making living
thank drive
part would feel safe autonomous vehicle year old child definitely feel would way safe driverless car verse getting driver license driving like simplicity safety aspect sure feel giving control freedom driving
finally cringy uber driver
lol
im going drive like maniac annoy bot time come cant wait
finally coming job driver driver become robber thief life harder harder human
actually best ad ive ever watched didnt skip
lol
never car computer could hacked trackedturn u rat maze
legally blind haha america
becomes thing future id really start miss driving
really want full time surveillance everything would captured camera really dangerous technology stay free country
inability reliably drive safely make autonomous car even safer gifting multiple extensive data set traffic accident gradually transicion completely driverless road point driverless car system accumilated enough experience accident caused driver error learn detect early sign best way react plethora scenario thing go wrong one car able make correction developing situation presicion speed machine potentially collaborating autonomous car involved mitigate completely prevent damage loss life
video bit biased favor waymo obviously sponsored biggest issue mind trust google safety software car opensource shouldnt used hard imagine bad scenario maybe waymo could require log google account car go anywhere think data could mine maybe google know search history doesnt like itll pick choose get car accident day furthermore general issue safety also risk car get hacked get malware installed mentioned car stop siren incident criminal pretend police officer pull people rob would stop fake siren happens try cross mountain road covered ice snow try drive crowded area like new york city im convinced watching take leisurely stroll around calm neighborhood handle complex situation driver find im convinced giving security privacy little bit convenience
agree made lot good point
tech video ad waymo pilot project restricted boring suburb commercial prospect driving million mile boring condition worthless driverless car may come day pilot demonstrates problem potential shame derek selling
wait future would help many people including disabled elderly
wait future
anyone else disappointed wasnt johnnycab driving
driverless car arent amazing say arebecause someone example go red lightthe car wont prepared could lead crash driver could prevent
car prepared human car much much much faster reaction time
yes truehowever person experience way knowledge like example avoid certain situation get situation deal robotcomputer cant doalso reaction speed important situation going crash matter knowing best way avoid injuriesdamage important
good yall derek veritasumteam highly worthy experiment promote easily applicable plethora place maybe yet enough hour trained different place condition im confident would required performed allow expansion imagine dangerplaces world sea motorcycle swarming road would lead notoverconfident automated system many unaccustomed people completely frozen manner solution sufficient resource obvious underresourced car crash capital may stay way
would valuable compare wymo lidar tech tesla vision understand sponsored visor
traffic police sir u need traffic police ahh help u ghost
think technology self driving vehicle possible main problem vision took human driver put helmet human could see computer seeing lidarcamerasradar etc would extremely hard replacement yet human vision yes lot drawback people get distracted cant physically see every direction time camera work well dark snow heavy rain etc theyre also looking thing like simple pothole road yes see self driving car detect large hole road board nail figuring debris road safe drive need potentially dangerous evasive action yes human make many error amount thing go wrong trip even advanced computer insane theyre forgetting every day occurances like road contruction mowing crew powerline maintenence crew detour road closure way many thing go wrong computer proven reliable thing like communter train run track set station see example sucess vancouver skytrain started running era computer train driver conductor bc transit security guard mostly checking make sure people paid fare ticket please dreaded word got board
one person made good comment plane cant pull side sky aircraft there problem sort like old joke think based go something like captain come pa announces lady gentleman technical issue one engine shut worry arrival minute delayed descend fl minute later weve lost engine worry still one delayed hour one passenger gripe spouse jeez lose another engine well day
feel safe autonomous car human driver road
say want hope overstatement trucker going first job dont believe bout money talk
lot issue driverless car human avoid manage better emergency situation like passenger need go hospital fast possible pregnant woman give birth would driverless car recognize situation act properly would break rule intelligence order solve situation sudden change surroundings like tree hit lightning landslide would driverless car react properly order predict avoid sort incident making specific maneuver would recognize exact situation act accordingly situation car cant move normally direction would find way get situation even hitting vehicle obstacle order prevent worse scenario happen remaining place aid people animal would stop assist people victim incident highly improbable scenario car world driverless maybe would incident people need help would recognize situation would stop allow passenger remove animal road save knocked car even though stop car fact driving make pay le attention road happen busy area would car let stay still forever waiting car pas would adapt situation even breaking rule needed like parking way isnt right still let car pas thing could happen
holy crap think saw vehical like five six time visited mother know suburb edit car drove better people near minute drove great actual people exact almosrt crashed back one driving near tech advanced enough opinion driverless car
im curious soon wont able drive manually road anymore point long manual driving become hobby private track rather public road
leave car dhaka make accident support
imagine car give inability take control youre getting pulled police would terrifying lol
im dying see ai car company called christine
nearly sideswiped someone whose car way solid double line clear condition okay self driving car also may best driver lol addition lazy would like take minute nap instead minute road rage also concept autonomous car going super fast ballet mean human driver could never keep guess human driver would still drive tornado autonomous car going around
hired spiderman camera shot
taxidriver job
still need driver licence car
doesnt perfect fewer mistake forgot
cgp gray said video doesnt perfect better u maybe thats
andys yeah something like thanks
reminds car cyberpunk body disposal package available bulletproofbombproof
autonomous driving work car autonomous connected also using u stats comparison cmon either country driver license license drive rather proof skill like germany france go extreme like middlefar east asian country pretty much buy one u several flaw mostly cause driver license license drive there much theoretics learn extensive practicing qualification test end hand bad road maintenance also bad road rule lot bad driver even following yes german autobahn rather safe even speed way beyond kmh well maintained driving school test pretty hard even earn driver license cause focus driving pasttime distracted thing drive drive drive focus road keep eye surroundings two basic rule always drive rightmost lane overtake left pretty much country world official speed limit part autobahn network history aside hitler planed prepare war
still year see full acar every road car driving fully mapped road perfect road line
cant see barely im legally blind tell still remembers meme
im ready dont drive like drive need driving mean another purpose parent cant really imagine future like hope people agree av logical next step
average driver drive mile year im driving km year mile parent dont drive much either friend dont drive much hundred km year didnt know uncommon social environment uncommon somehow tiny percentage drive hundred thousand mile year
location lifestyle dependent drive mile work mile back grocery mean driving meeting friend back car weekend family need help something want something well mile one way
think saw car le week ago went san francisco vacation walking chinatown saw car exact thing top color look familiar sure name
reminds youre stupid youd walk parked car
get fully fledged well irl fast travel
wouldnt said year like knew close close
technology make much easier certain segment population make money already upwardly mobile great driverless car safe currently stand weapon working class
personally dont think autonomous vehicle going commonplace soon mainly price theyre going expensive viable everyday worker
deal pothole florida
safety never never largest concern basic human right freedom biggest problem there entire team people watching literally time there camera around car mean car end privacy time watched recorded tracked government use technology exponentially expand spy state already live insurance company legislator charge higher premium individual driver nonautonomous vehicle pushing everyone merely based cost perhaps even ban together go basic human right travel freely like covid crisis trade away right safety truly terrifies yes people gladly give basic human right right neighbor child idea safety
truly hope human dumb enough believe car drove mph day everyday nonstop year maybe would approach million mile lolz
honestly driverless taxi service may need rethink business plan buy driverless car drive around instead paying driverless taxi service drive around
google girl super cute
good vid please consider buying tesla full self driving make vid tesla full self driving sponsored tesla
car city year possible vehicle drive country point anybody work transporting get trouble since autonomous vehicle dont need get paid b autonomous vehicle cause le accident autonomous vehicle dont need pause human weeknesses like taking rest even sleep mean vehicle cheaper long run human driver includes people transportation like taxi bus includes transportation good well think many truck see daily basis become autonomous vehicle future driver lose job talk totally different scale elevator driver talk million people lose job strike people case wealthy first place technology strike hard society equipped yet considering problem result already late regarding action climate change public arent aware problem yet see poll majority people believe autonomous driving happen next year yet derek drive around fully autonomous car wonder long take problem visible hope wont late take action information invention big deal check cgp grey video human need apply
blah channel become shill fest really take away useful info there undertone agenda pushing
ultimately stupid enough system fail one able drive computer rebooted computer fail freeze happen driverless car place driverless car yes today rain snow mud debris effect camera cause fail
big question deal lot employee work today transportation industry taxi bus truck name job done dusted employee secured income operating vehicle longer needed job even high paying one often require special skill appropriate driver license crisis going witness
ill never drive soon fully autonomous vehicle legally allowed
one consideration effect automation capitalism adoption selfdriving car thats lot people would slowly lose competitive relevance taxi uber trucking delivery transition infrastructure place let honest place like uk america theyd likely receive little social welfare assist transitioning fieldsprevent unemployed could hurt lot worker shouldnt deter innovation cause u reflect system treat victim automation work towards smarter solution
people average arent good driving taking away choice good thing either mention become main place may take ability drive people expected enough money one still dont car worth much even compared computer also speeding nothing accident unless person going obscenely recommended speed quite frequently live almost normal go mile speed limit except within town limit people still go arent people usually giving stink eye slow even slow lane there also privacy issue car currently arent owned individual company database go go place im still agreement either
prefer control myzelf wont ever give freedom drive matter safe risk part life
thought process going get u extinct
madsusmonday thought process made tech like possible
would never work indian road indian traffic indian driver
without speeding ticket cop make money
well selfdriving car technology challenging selfdriving airplane drone still airplane flying without pilot today wonder beside technical issue serious ethical legal issue example collision inevitable crash scenariopath shall selfdriving car take drive concrete wall kill passenger drive bus stop kill crowd people saving life passenger legally responsible pay monetary compensation victim manufacturer selfdriving algorithm insurance company passengersowner car addition shown already worth pump selfdriving car expensive hightech sophisticated equipment need maintain make software update replace often hardware simply expensive lidar stereo imaging radio radar acustical etc sensor well powerful computer process data sensor work good bad weather condition like snowing raining dusty environment etc instead society shall invest smart city highway infrastructure vehicle road get realtime information traffic situation road vehicle selfdriving get information via g high speed network traffic routed optimally safe way also allow reduce emission avoid traffic jam potential accident much efficiently future
ultimate problem see autonomous vehicle person decides car drive car work environment put
car decide drive environment automatically stop cant
people work driver back elevator automated thats went strike better time around
ethical situation dont look scenario look multiple equal distribution etc something random
there extra advantage mainly selfdriving car every car would know car going would mostly eliminate crash
video kind depressing doesnt even consider much sustainable efficient possibility taking car road making road smaller improving public transport like trainstramsbuses could also driverless already place redesigning space people walk bike take public mass transit need go instead forced using car driverless
selfdriving car future car simply future delusional attempt keeping unsustainable way living
problem hacking computer
love video vehicle really impressive really tech software engineer say ai designer data scientist know theyre issue human driver trust around autonomous vehicle company like tesla outright lying autonomous driving mode becomes huge mess ethic business priority liable autonomous vehicle kill someone get hacked auto vehicle get virus cause stupid thing road vehicle become huge black box normal people user owner wouldnt even know fix take care naturally totally eliminate vehicle ownership must rely company like waymo transport human youve restricted freedom travel route programmed see going unfortunately autonomous vehicle truly work well human vehicle ownership need go therefore putting freedom movement hand ai company making ai isnt good thing human already losing crucial lifesustaining skill every new generation many people know hunt farm food today exactly autodriving reducing general human ability taking away common motorskills people dont feel like lead better future motorskills situational awareness decision making pressure important human skill maintain even lead accident process never safe imho airplane comparison really invalid plane arent really worried traffic pedestrian pilot go insane expensive training licensing engage auto pilot button unfortunately road arent empty sky finally covid taught u anything government absolute control travel whereabouts really give even power ie ability disable autonomous car click button dont want u move around like grounded airplane stopped travel nation stroke pen still cant see family international travel restriction month mercy douche bag office see loved one personally dont think good idea future want freedom trump safety human shouldnt looking reason lazy incompetent sleeping car drive u home implication tech way beyond youve shown video good future every way look
stop autonomous vehicle using loud ambulance sound see vulnerability future must secure common machine readable way signaling ambulance police firefighter coming
even mention tesla year ahead automotic technology anybody heh funny
real solution good public transportation
riding madison exactly point autonomous vehicle going solve traffic
think people would agree want fully autonomous vehicle want everyone else ride autonomous vehicle want drive vehicle
plot twist hub human drive car remotely
would want one accident snowseems like car fine anything isnt plain ol driving know plane land heavy fog vienna yet several accident near accident automation actually caused accident max recent qantas computer thought plane started dropping sky cuz something computer ofc there many time computer actually woulda saved day pilot done nothing like kenya airline flight didnt follow autopilot crashed plane also air france flight stalled like foot pancaked atlantic pilot didnt believe seeing kept plane nose stalled whole way respond train crossing
watch movie upgrade youll see bad idea
wan na justify making automated vehicle movie
madsusmonday got ta see movie
would point driver license getting one car future
someone working autonomous driving really enjoyed video however reason believe cant yet replace human human factor neural network trained analyze surrounding car still much biased might trained well specific suburb highway place different layout andor surroundings throw try going street forest also car trained deer might detect there something cant detect might react poorer human cause hasnt trained believe almost certainly trained besides often data used train neural network bias people color disabled people wheelchair might falsely detected bench car assumes person sitting still instead going road thing due human select data training looking preventing bias topic many company start look im even going attack autonomous car ever saw give car trapped circle salt cause thing thats cross lane marking autonomous car driving behind truck transport traffic light car detects traffic light installed road edge case sure human would know react would recognize nonsense autonomous car decide situation nonsense ignoring sensor data seems like bad idea well tho absolutely think autonomous car become norm exposed problem still specific almost controlled environment dont believe future close yet though hope proven wrong working
explain bias people color work context please
billyumbraskey maybe software likely think black individual wearing black clothing inanimate object like statue tree however speculation also dont really see person skin color influence decision made computer unless software never got people color input meaning cant recognize however would unlikely would also affect fat people much
billyum google ai bias people color youll find lot renowned article example
tirsatalks presumably working knowledge unable unwilling form response explaining position word pretty suspect going google junk science ai subjective bias make sense ai decision heuristic mayne ai actually account difference exists like maybe ai learns black tend ignore crossing signal others reacts approaching intersection black appropriately different way never know difference nowadays considered racist part observer never consider could behavior different along racial axis another reason besides political correctness boogeyman hate mining
cheezymuffin even likely none malice assigned ai exists instead difference behavior among group exists
cry third world country
fully accept driverless car safe technology sound holy crap wheres fun love driving sad grey mundane world everyone riding around thing sure road would safer im happy take increased risk measure control driving allows unfortunately seem heading toward future personal agency thing past sad
know car thing wonder look like put effort public transport autonomous train bus traffic jam issue self driving car dont get wrong love car point car drive take bus train little comment
really wouldnt mind dc suburb time need commute office mile away mile doesnt sound like lot dc area could take minute could take hour predicting bad traffic hour advance always ready grueling multihour slog get one thing done exhausting could listen music take nap wading traffic jam would enormous improvement quality life
work remotely problem solved there little reason today actually need waste time going office
realize existed solution problem decade electric long time well called train
time relaiable secure well
brnmcc everyone option
driverless car traffic also significantly reduced since car may possibly coordinate one another including traffic system reduce block jam
work multiple waymos near chance cross lidar beam make one car think safe go forward actually
seeing car driver think weird
also million driver loo job
want know someone cover light sign shoot laser beam sensor counter
question didnt see answered stop sign visible object stop light visible light recognize color simply sequence light light vary according state vertical others horizontal ive seen traffic signal blowing terrible weather would driverless car bad thunderstorm even tornado pop nowhere would car handle large hailstone instead high speed train could see high speed driverless lane road even road talk car would car parked blizzard condition deep snow could see sensor road communicating shoulder mention lidar able see snow
think future people dont want driving car becomes exotic luxury like riding horse
think go far try remove steering wheel giving driver little control terrible
ive driving year yeah accident far got like year driving experience omnidirectional vision trust way basically every driver road lmao
wonder happens hundred car road around one another significant lidar radar interference effect imagine interference could impact driving capability driverless car dont know sure
cutest car ever seen nano car
calidouchery
much convincing tesla
please discus eye health issue lidar car scanning million time per second range meter imagine human eyeball sea av study shown nm laser perfectly safe human eye accept level risk blindness innocent pedestrian wildlife eye damage cmos camera imagine world walking million laser scan per second per car engulfing body situation dining sidewalk cafe busy street lidar coverage would unfathomable lidar invasion home window night brave new world sound amazing would one first stand line av however lidar issueit need serious explaining thanks
im curious would stop car middle driving wouldnt want able rare case make mistake mean first selfdriving car button
need better public transportation thats accessible come regularly dont need schedule go around public transportation ideal thing even supporting self driving vehicle
let know handle wednesday morning commute work minnesota snowed inch cant even see curb sign still dark black ice underneath snow fleet snowplow flashing orange light trying plow highway hit gas wheel spin ice snow dont forget sensor caked snow ice also see
im engineer industrial automation sector im totally onboard selfdriving car theyre better human think well still need override various unpredictable situation thats available see way rational society rational person reject technology still give pause see child booster back seat behind derek
think driving fun matter good technology become long drive car wont use trust there lot people feel
thatangrygerman also lot people dying car crash human error
liquoricilicious yeah know human error kill people everywhere car im banking making error kill someone else
liquoricilicious well suck doesnt
vergildisparda future going illegal drive even going issue
cat iii landing airport need preparedcertified would equivalent changing road make communicate selfdriving car bet know make thing much hideschange prove point video
wallet
way would ever get car one behind wheel barely trust getting friend car anyones car except driving would u even want get rid driving car driving fun
bunch car lidar radar wouldnt lidar radar pulse interfere making car blind
get camera angle driver seat nobody front dont see camera dereks view
elevator arror silence lamb
saying ai car wont thing future video highly biased nevermind waymo sponsoring video major valid criticism autonomous driving never mentioned seems like guy regurgitating talking point leader autonomous driving industry painful unsubscribe channel
id rather dumb as road kill government targeting car termination
opinion think im good driver dont get distracted dumb thing im smart enough think would happen yk
thought know derek believe explain thing people first eliminating misconception interesting topic let clear something first fully onboard autonomous car trip bit probably people trying find evidence autonomous car claim million mile much experience compared regular driver objectively speaking true hand derek said car probably struggle poorly maintained road example yet driver km experience basically rookie compared car problem whatsoever driving poorly maintained road dirt road software engineer tried explain benefit self driving car people see common set misconception people seem struggle understand computer algorithm driving car much better human situation problem remaining due nature computer tend make mistake seem obvious u human apply confirmation bias shot idea thing said mistake basically obeying traffic law getting intentionnaly unintentionally distracted computer never thing u human alwasy think yeah never happen dont see benefit computer giant calculator looking pattern might million find pattern shouldnt execute maneuver may result accident see tesla virtually brand point car driving seemingly perfect make turn leave road simply ignore stopped vehicle cause accident nature algorithm poorly programmed trained model could make mistake course human would react like wtf car made right turn highway got road human would never make stupid mistake course mistake would probably mistake human side making extremely rare statistically even worth discussing point long comment sometimes attempt promote progress company like waymo make big bold statement like million mile experience much human provoke reaction like oh yeah million mile huh drove drive poorly mainteined road cant maybe bit transparancy number mean reality bit education thing work better even though seemingly sometimes make best judgement perspective human driver might push thing right direction quick example quck sudden squeeking stop infront man cart kind stop expected rookie driver even though fully understand thing happen people tend expect attitude someone something droven million mile
someone life manitoba id curious well itd work c blizzard weather january february drive differently ice incompare arizona asphalt would cold weather freeze vital component would snow interfere laser sensor guess im cautiously optimistic self driving car

mean video sponsored company make vehicle video worthless m full stop
would love someone go safety electronics sensor protection laser damage camera sensor happens sensor get damaged im worried anything im worried human error would nice know protected
even technology people like stuff old way decent amount job couldve done home pandemic didnt wasnt pandemic wouldnt even thought ofconsidered working home
one mention cyber hacker huh
vehicle waymo experience human driver
smart phone electric car video game play make happy die one day taking juice life
put road terrible driver louisville ky pas recklessly aggressive overlypassive unpredictable driver population pas almost anywhere example want see handle ie interchange moron cutting front big rig truck last ft
pedestrian walk stationary car hurt
really curious computer land plane scooter pedestrian runway besides gtr lamborghini would rather drive
insurance company get board check mate happening
cia doesnt like take control car gps drive cliff
car safe unless super strong defence mechanism cyber attack
best defence internet connection dont expect company lose appetite exploiting user
ya couple generation everyone know drive car much like farming hunting becoming today fact nothing may need wow wait security worth giving right responsibility couple hundred year machine take care every need sol sneeze huge emp like wave something killing machinescomputers remember repair math read education enforcement cooperative assistance prudent machine help u replace u assist u control u
kid trying explain signal light kid pace
end putting car road well still problem traffic still make living city lot car awful
wont effect way taxi didnt effect drive around day ferrying people around town instead needing separate car individual commuter
channel good production value impressed knowledge video way biased topic scientist technician self driving car technology work significantly advanced average person know like computer scientist getting working seems enough modern business model allow technology company release baked working program charging full price accepted citing crash death remember based upon driver perform multiple trip cycle average day true safety comparison valid impressed ai technology vehicle fully expect mature would never trust general use right america road vary widely quality gps mapped poorly area ai relative infancy technologynetworks glitch frequency acceptable life line dont forget genius car must also enter roadway unpredictable human appreciate biggest problem tech giant behind car willing proceed profit margin important prework even discussed show multiyear plan includes unbiased prediction impact high powerprospectivedoubleblind testing liability handled mistake made suspect replacing impaired driver vehicle might actually ready ridiculous act like doesnt require important oversight provided competent legal system biased lobby
sofia thought year autonomous vehicle could superior human driver dont like idiot say put road see happens lb metal object hurling street need flawless
cant believe compare single airplane accident new technology flying still way safer driving car flying autopilot wonder dont pilotless airplane far much decisionmaking computer take account contrast aviation elevator like mentioned road condition etc im sure technology acceptable certain area certain city acceptable everywhere decade come human fully autonomous ai traffic vehicle mix well since human unpredictable giving passenger backseat chance interfere ai decisionmaking way make fully autonomous vehicle integrate ai car human driver like tesla
nybbl er man making dumb assumption
dont even understand argument say human unpredictable follow saying thats reason keep human yes human ai dont mesh well human human worse
nybbl er human disabled automation causing problem first place
ai still able predict human better human full self driving best solution
plenty accident driver turned autonomous driving crashed sued tesla best human dont interfere
wish would stop looking car solution accident death traffic real solution train bus city infrastructure doesnt require driving literally everywhere absolutely anything
need forget focus driverless vehicle honestly make public transportation solution k car death year traffic everywhere isnt car even drive solution literally train town walk without drive every time need milk
report completely transparent trust veritasium perhaps waymo werent completely forthcoming accident million mile since also disengagement human forced take avoid accident get figure lot closer zero people naturally even incorrectly going confidence tell there one chance million astra zenica jab kill rare blood clotting disease one chance could die contracting covid drop million virtually nonexistent everyone virus cant spread people still resist getting vaccinated human nature like control mortality
need much much better infrastructure safe multiple car road
like
video full many wonderful news one question want maintain steering wheel model vehicle release removed
ronald yeah dont say car level security higher model
real question still train driver
love derek get aggressive towards human video progress
seeing viral tesla model x accident stop near big obstacle autonomus car seems like far away
lol try india
biggest issue self driving car unexpected situation especially one human would better dirty sign example human would recognize sign computer could misinterpret dirty sign something completely different think could solution technology already infrastructure car future different problem human car require different solution unlike electric hydrogen car better petrol mean refill tank scarce electric getting better nowadays
agree would better one problem u hacked someone could control car crash car thats kind problem think
waiting autonomous uber service since yr ago
need better driver current road world suitable driverless car many variable would rip every road world place driverless car safe road easily read going happen
mentioned waymo car geofenced one neighbourhood phoenix arizona
exactly
comment way higher
thats implied figured
alankwellsmsmba thats definitely implied video almost one know
james say certain part phoenix near beginning video
eliminate parking lot self driving car mentioned end understand would happen
im wondering passenger could take theyre backseat seperated plastic wall youd think someone would sitting driver seat take needed
remember blue screensimagine getting blue screen mile hour thankyou
probably stating anything unique giant cash cow known traffic violationscitations would certainly threatened automobile didnt break traffic law speed trap duo stop really would even need driver licence would minimum age many question hmmmmnn
man fast future
pretty scary stuff end schoolyear year like special day stuff one driving stuff since take lisence talk many thing one question u parent distracted thing driving phone book etc almost everyone raised hand norway place id consider quite good driver really concerning see
stop commercial man
wish spent bit time technology far know huge difference airplane autopilot selfdriving car best knowledge airplane autopilot system rely entirely precise sensor signal landing advanced beacon let plane know exactly going make relatively easy implement safely traditional programming technology car rely called ai neural network sure become quite reliable end day nobody really know whats going inside ai think think shown neutral network reliable easily fooled weird input therefore matter long observe car driving safely way know suddenly misinterpret something crash think big shame didnt even go issue really love content channel otherwise
still like drive car
harper people dont wan na
ad
driverless car computer connected network computer hacked enemy enemy hack computer current vehicle manual window lock
opinion autonomous car safer entire street autonomous car took manual car maniac driver make autonomous car safer driver car safer autonomous car try prevent accident driver take advantage bully every autonomous car making autonomous car stop driver car rush everything worse situation autonomous driver car slightly better driver car compared autonomous car making people unwilling choose autonomous car never get chance move dangerous thanks jackass exploiting safety system mere second faster new dilemma moral dilemma prisoner dilemma
netherlands nearly solved issue already called road design u road standard dont enough regulation regarding safety thats kill people doesnt even address lack population density rural suburban area horrible road design reason lack empathy anti social behavior often associated suburb specifically design community around car rather people create environment associated depression destroys aspect community proliferates sociopathy transportation way live automation bandage problem much deeper people think
thats around people die year netherlands due car crash many self driving car would make
matthewstrauck nearly died united state time thats death per thousand people netherlands rate im saying car dont kill people im saying automation wont help like said like putting bandage deeper issue solves death problem problem building life community around car still remain need public infrastructure accommodate transportation need thing often already automated completely million time safer reducing pollution allowing increased population density would improve unity relationship within community reduce anti social behavior mental issue associated isolation
arguing different topic architecture topic video
vprw people see automation cure problem car society glossing issue associated car travel thats im pointing community car centric higher rate sociopathy reduced communal connection increased rate depression human social specie car isolate u community thats probably untied state specifically struggling mass delusion ever increasing mental health crisis easy live ignorance hate connection around
aylamurphy opinion car problem related car entirely surrounding interesting view subject though
problem still look soooo bad sensor still big
year twice weekly half hour commute train took week get act together manage get hour week relaxed steady reading wonder could happen autonomous car auto auto
old car like brick nokia new phone
ohh boi cant wait
really question whether trust eye camera sensor autonomous vehicle question whether trust software engineer built software considered edge case created bugle flawless machine course even considered itll probably decrease fatality rate significantly
remeber people accidently die road
would nice one car need license
imagine never able break speed limit movement tracked sake safety eventually freedom driving outlawed altogether government im happy everyone trust hacker ransome ride home good luck
believe first place fully automated car system small organized country like netherlands singapore japan ok maybe small u probably one last country embrace
u china leading world autonomous system regulatory environment eu make harder test system thats there autonomous car anywhere outside china even autonomous pizza car lol
johanfalk make sense thinking line u culture people resistant giving driving freedom country willing work together agree change system
better average human indeed thats question want drive car theyll better driverless car ever increasing bar cant wait future
would fact literally completely screw car black square placed stop sign nonstandard traffic light stop sign one series arrest around u partial self driving level human monitored lvl however would comfortable watch stuff also driving nj shown people barely controljudge car
read paper carefully screw pattern recognizer actually classifier training properly full knowledge system design pattern specifically fool al thats quite simple solve car compare picture real sign compare check
would always trust autonomous vehicle driver
see technology invade every human practice scary movie plot go real
think reason people dont trust driverless car probably programmed another human make mistake
avid car guy hate fine civilian purpose like video game play pointless also drive job happen like money
love
id like see bunch running around area see deal lidar interference car cant deal novelty example driverless thing dont really apply car driverless elevator people never controlled elevator didnt understand simple actually plane different situation car dont predefined path avoids car plane much leeway error almost flight point control critical flight controller coordinating everything radio beam lining
first thing wan na say even watch video lmao fully autonomous vehicle required day like human driver know run people job best efficiency safety etc think ever traffic jam light youre maybe behind car light finally turn green expect able stat moving right away green right wrong wait first car accelerate second car accelerate first car car fully autonomous light turned green could send signal every single car waiting light start accelerating exact time speed waiting car infront move quicker drive easy believe flawed im happy hear thought
thrilled experience selfdriving car indian road
wonder would handle hydroplane wonder could anticipate hydroplane autonomous vehicle hold great promise
people think theyre better average people mean average one people believing better driver simply mean average one people believe average driver actually better one make sense come road accident
love driving there one thing trust le drive thats everyone else
cybersec
speeding relative assuming distraction everyone speed le chance accident compared variable speed car slowed changed lane suddenly merger didnt match speed car main road
live part arizona im going try
stop using car altogether theyre terrible environment inefficient space wise cost much produce capacity train bus
cant implement alle level independent important many people
gov control car situation like riot stuff situation one want get away mean run away police govforceshe simply cantas vehicle controlits govs control think itgovs state love idea fund itso would evolve faster
im ready sell car use app request ride
riding grace way cross normal walk front everyone stop
id like present issue driverless car usually make people doubt excitement getting one future country applies simple rule driving well life course responsible injury cause would ok convicted homicide car autonomously decides make maneuver save life take one instead simple paradox change everything
car completly self driving accident become company fault long didnt interfer
lot people throw situation system likely cant handle properly yet way discredit technology fair moment thing many year ago autonomous car general might well fevered dream technology advancing ever faster le time took u go car without cruise control self driving car likely autonomous car handle driving condition competently average human driver love driving tech inevitably reach point full competency
yeah driverless car cool really need riderless unicycle
fully autonomous car wrong solution wrong problem
fun game hacker fly cliff
dont want car deciding death full stop
might butt autopilot airplane actually limited weather bad yes theyre nice landing fog generally mean low wind velocity put autopilot gusty wind input need job become erratic instance seen autopilot disconnect hand make flying plane fully automatic need advanced level ai centered decision making since thats pilot nowadays im pretty sure couple generation itll become reality though main concern airline cutting cost yeah dont see wouldnt happen
would happen robber barricade road car stop wont accelerate ull lose everythingor way detect
sure somewhere china actually looking car fact allowed go without driver
waymo hey pay money make video guy come credible scientist trustworthy rd party interest tell million viewer product safe awesome derek hehe ok done isnt science product marketing worst lol
want johnny cab like total recall
im glad im building trade plumbing carpentry unlikely taken robot lifetime feel sorry taxi driver though
nah dont worry gov step protect seemingly disenfranchised mark word soon l system actually come online none start see luddite suit gilded hall making rule quell long possible advancement country adopt reap benny
cracktune
dont worry mate
people worse worse everyday everything
highfalutin bell statistically zoom output simultaneously trade forenenst adorable friend faint fair pretty sofa
much car cost
im self driving lightning strike situation fully autonomous car way human operate car someone simply stood front car another decided rob would get away
reason asiana didnt auto landing il day
really isnt excuse sunny day problem company culture rely autopilot never fly manually unless necessary unlike western company stick rudder flying perfectly normal wellpracticed u driven around year one driverless car driving skill would degrade well also passenger saw u something stupid probably would actually say something
sntslilhlpr yes
sntslilhlpr true bit complicated example user interface documentation good made easier make mistake could even say autothrottle logic buggy ntsb conclusion contributing accident complexity autothrottle autopilot flight director system inadequately described boeings documentation asianas pilot training increased likelihood mode error particular autothrottle behavior inconsistent depending mode ntsb accident report written statement asiana ground school instructor indicated would sometimes remain hold mode ap disconnected airspeed could drop described anomaly boeing autothrottle functioning personally experienced three separate occasion normally autothrottle prevent aircraft stalling recently used flch mode flight level change enters hold mode doesnt anymore meant aircraft gave warning speed got low didnt spool engine flight pilot reacted second received warning late behavior offering stall protection hold mode initially even documented aircraft manual year accident boeing updated manual include information could say boeing instead fixing bug documented feature yes pilot made mistake mistake clearly needed training automation great either poor safety culture boeing frequently documenting bug feature finding workarounds instead fixing one intention fly boeing plane next year see max mcas debacle recently starliner problem example boeings poor safety culture said would problem using autonomous car proven safety record autonomous car could pull side road software fails push red button aircraft bit complicated since cant pull aircraft side sky automation fails never say never airbus even boeing able create autonomous aircraft actually safer piloted aircraft would fly one take lot boeing rebuild trust lost recent failure case plan commercial autonomous passenger aircraft short medium term start reducing number pilot two one require automation
get impression video considers driving city transportation work etc ie driving transportation scenario maybe driverless car would useful however aid rather fixig problem better underground train service bus etc would far better solution however rest u dont live work city especially country outside u
driving outside city even easier much le stuff happening mostly going straight car handle city handle everything else well
dariolehm ever drove country road twisty dirt rock
jasonherron im grew village people bigger town nearby still proper road everywhere
dariolehm maybe year ago road leading grandparent village ridden pothole sometimes make snap decision pothole smallest avoid pothole damaging car
laszlomeszaros yeah thats id least expect driverless car government community cant afford fix road there little chance regular citizen afford driverless car think driverless car suited suburb driverless train would city
im ready autonomous car
there great video technology connection talk use led traffic light better almost every way havent implemented new flaw present blown proportion preventing accident creating new one occur even tenth often easy choice ill link video channel reply
sometimes
video make uncomfortable control system programmer year including ai experience would trust code deal unexpected unanticipated scenario slamming brake unnecessarily video good machine predictable response easy make reliable several concern foremost driving getting b transportation something enjoy immensely wife kid enjoy going drive doesnt anywhere car drive matter way drive matter enjoyment driving matter way selfdriving car ever successful people drive car selfdriving hope long dead time agree safety aspect fewer death important consideration however sterilising life taking experience risk mistake risk life stimulating good look result preventing kid falling tree scraping knee etc etc
say video system caused accident people fault
get stolen
airplane problem cited paradox caused combination fly wire autopiloting pilot used computer correcting mistake fly little air plane prone mistake similar level self driving car fix assisted driving approach car try learn tell driver making mistake course result newer problem know russian air plane pilot let kid pilot seat trusting autopilot disengage problem autopilot model would disengage soon course correct applied bump control conclusion challenge
virus
happens multiple autonomous car one place use laser measure reflected light environment doesnt disturb autonomous car multiple laser nearby
dont think even light beam intercept dont exactly interfere much mess wavelength solved dont intercept move back normal
came az got ta get proper taco next time
grow want get driver license try get close paying job near get bike walk work
gon na take think enough people normalizing video like
mean driving game without player model front seat actually semirealistic
really need start making look like corvette mustang get car guy board
dont speak every enthusiast care infinitely driving experience making look like whatever car make difference
there potential disaster awaiting u automated car take think video solar flare electronic device go haywire short enough largescale catastrophe
normal car would die lol
omg cool
come hold little selfie stick turn around cant see work
dont want commute work home driverless vehicle still vehicle need bycicles people wasting time get office something could home
autobots time arrived transform roll
person scared learning drive would nice hahaha
fear look even scarier
case elevator im pretty sure motion
robot take quicker proof he robot
try amsterdam chaos bicycle traffic trust driverless vehicle cant make eye contact computer get rid parking space replacing green space go visit netherlands
okay derek im gon na point pointed pedestrian ever supposed cross ballet selfdriving car enjoy green space take car cross road think autopilot car deal american way solving car problem
still red light fact efficient selfdriving car could start driving time unison car arent going drive something blocking way would able tell car around wont moving none car rearend one another agree serious car issue road across nation already constructed dont really know otherwise need bigger better public transportation selfdriving bus would one way go
opinion car drive better people know
driverless car drop time take get place place half human error cause traffic jam accident also focused road better people right mean one whose glued phone thing cause accident stupidity forgetting sleep enough trusting brake long ago remember change waiting last minute drive like maniac road catch trying show imaginary none existence skill ending discovering got none late cant spot road imperfection least range metre shouldnt driving safety distracted phone tourist driver keep adjusting thier seatbelt thier seat looking stuff back seat involve conversation easily forget car driver leave wheel mind driverless car p tourist drive one go site seen going mph twisting thier head side side clear view looking back long amount time tell entering incoming traffic despite unrealistic may sound actually met kind people saw misfortune run road car
say every car road lidar top lidar interfere
thing holding self driving car back technology morality law longer matter whether autonomous car work know question fault aka liable something go wrong especially u legislation happy country question sue get hurt somehow automated vehicle paramount thus autonomous car truly get road u legislator must come answer fundamental question know legislation take forever especially complex subject
concern came drive wrong location hacked outside influence drive place get robbed saw movie xd avoid dangerous place happened map realworld dont line like road suppose seen couple time google map
great video except one critical oversight cybersecurity demonstration hacking regular electronic car autonomous vehicle year car fully autonomous assume connected internet persumably could kidnap belonging ransom change course dangerous area tamper one car system brake steering door lock etc even ac really deserves mention
imagine impact supply chain thousand unmanned truck traveling consistent safe speed hour night dont get tired dont need many pit stop reliably predict eta inform waiting end precisely expect shipment
like thought
imagine raise amount cargo every one truck carry improve efficiency build road cargo could go improve efficiency even make road metal wheel metal thinking name maybe something like rail truck train imagine much would nice could carry people packed city could build underground maybe capilarities flow justify building track could make big driverless car could fit people
seemysight isnt auto train already
would need emp device rob unmanned truck middle nowhere emps difficult make maybe jammer could also trick also would need g network every roadway highway g network signal drop would cost benefit supply chain lifespan let forget much telecom company would charge x g connection impact would pricing edit add premium paid bigtech self driving driver accurate eta bad deal viable technology would tough time finding market
shivamaggarwal quantum computing would make nonissue
first im onboard idea driverless car like cant wait fully automated car real thing meaning actually get hand money actually realistic get think fact go driver driven car driverless car slowing process lot driverless car take stupid action driver make account process would much easier smoother car simply self utopia could simply replace every traditional car driverless car one day next save ourself lot programming workarounds people stupid action also fear many people fully automated driven car prone hacked based assumption everything go internet really dosent fact video saw way remote control car internet take control car remote input perhaps still car make decision get understand thing still hacked even connected internet become bit tricky hack theory could car knew law traffic gps location well gps location go could build mental internally map converting video model world around map thereby learning deadends current location destination time become better better making route internet needed drive car automatically know seems pretty unlikely remote updating map car data base much easier would require internet access im suggesting solution im saying possible make people also scared technology mess well people mess time like said thats approx accident happen people scared technology say yes exactly people making technology well true technology messup happens engineer come back next day clear head improves technology code becomes better better people always remain around average capability drive car also like fact arent afraid internet connected car everyone could privilege parking space disabled person dont envy disabled people parking space one could actually dropped right entrance mall place simply car find suitable parking space close possible ready get picked use app phone call upon car come pick based proximity phone could enter mall one side get picked end also talk car make traffic ballet become self driven guess point earlier step self driven car drove utopia scenario traffic ballet
system get hacked could cause chaos
much dont trust technology mean technology fail dont trust driver
didnt look uk viewer lol driver
think manual overhaul still important though motoway recently big bit metal middle lane swerved got hard shoulder parked moved way everyone else driverless car would stop intervein humanity replicable
could see car emergency stop button
dont doubt capability selfdriving car im doubting bunch people whoe programed human making human mistake
literally day video posted driving speed limit interstate middle lane got sideswiped drunk driver going mph left lane caused car crash car totaled luckily major injury literally nothing could done avoid accidenti lane person literally drove right lane travesty people routinely die kind human error driverless car need adopted asap
driving motorcycle intersection green light car ran red light intersection looking traffic coming intersection right slowing intersection red light turned green began accelerate back traffic speed believe multiple factor involved driver new driver turned day upon examination intersection poorly designed right lane car driving ended intersection forced driver quickly try attempt vere left adjacent lane causing turn head look left see car left leaving blind oncoming traffic right also time delay red light green light two road intersection give buffer time driver trying run red light may turned red like accelerated speed case intersection also blind intersection driver approaching right lane deadends intersection coming intersection around bend would see lane ending could see traffic right intersection practically intersection also road car going downhill slightly would make harder stop car also side intersection car going steep uphillwhich would cause driver gun accelerator drive car hill without stalling car car manual gear shift transmission would even cause difficulty driver distraction entering intersection would see also needing go uphill intersection also tree bush along side road intersection leading intersection impairing view car lane leading intersection also traffic entering intersection right also going downhill slight downgrade would also cause vehicle momentum gravity trying stop guessing driver approached intersection knowing approaching traffic signal intersection also turning red speed also realizing simultaneously lane entering ending intersection would need vere left lane entering intersection also realizing drive steep hill side intersection people installing traffic signal device failed provide buffer time transpire light turning red opposing road light turning green many thing could done make intersection safer even considering water oil road make even little slippery cause lot injury sadly car might fared better gone back intersection year later still badly designed sure changed redgreen timing road entering intersection give buffer
public transport anyone
never want driverless car car make decision whether let one occupant live pedestrian crossing road live calculate loss life protecting driver honest dont care im comparing much care im letting car kill ill plow people option brick wall want driverless car incredibly stupid way selfless deserve life youve given
love idea reducing road accident establishing self driving car system also make world boring good people want reach destination
want know much skynet paying
nissan r skyline owner want nondriver road im also scared insurance company going death auto industry road trip drive cost high people build work around car said car guy pissed optimist well hack either way whatever want insert scene th element cab driving
drink drive
fully trust driverless car still thing flying animal driverless car react since flying animal simply fly get near everywhere
id feel comfortable using driverless car cause dont drive im wondering future company waymo using taxi public able buy use software run car included price subscription kind thing keep road see becoming handy also see becoming expensive nuisance see company charging king ransom use cough apple adobe cough
need remove patent
tl would anyone innovate without ability commercially exploit invention
city public transport system trolley bus might adopt idea
go uber
driverless car could driverless bus train
idk let ask guy getting paid driverless car company
im primarily worried one thing come self driving vehicle becoming norm hacking weve already seen attack infrastructure like water processing gas line targeted terroristhackers undoubtedly look opening think asked people trust fellow citizen human error corporate people wont care statistic theyll care choice make feel
would able hack car isnt software board reason connection outside
dariolehm guess dont understand car work think self driving car navigates little dumb dumb using onboard computer thats connected quite outside piece tech work
kimberlee onboard computer need connexted anything software driving environmental data gathered car need connect anything outside need would mean couldnt use car remote area
find amusing everyone fly jet airplane jet flight autopilot even land take without pilot

besides fact fully autonomous car wipe million job taxi uber driver environmental city planning perspective driverless car arent great first even car electric arent bad environment still creates lot pollution build actual car could create le pollution public transport furthermore come big city move people around greater scale much faster subway system also subway system take much le space parking lot driverless car could place somewhere still inferior public transport city actually good public transport think real beauty driverless car exists bus split subway line bring people place arent close dedicated subway line individual owning driverless car future rather remnant bygone past
would change trucking industry
great video though really wish wouldve covered efficiency aspect driverless car aka ai trip calculation autonomous vehicle interaction
im really interested see drive small town italy europe general
slowly like human driver computer still benefit able identify every object within lineofsight something human physically incapable remembering object properly considering significance choosing next action matter training computer sufficiently problem exists human driver
probably never drive business tesla expense difficult area like xd please try proof wrong year
james theyre affordable youll totally wrong haha tesla superior vehicle thus expensive idk range seems like would taxi service le like uber doesnt seem like youd one like youd tesla also everyone gon na want tesla due battery waste wtf gon na battery problem fixed wouldnt ever one bc youre harm good
kaleb might wan na research tesla service cheapest hand battery recycled efficiently guess see year
small city great ai learning car
event car jacking
think bigger question whether safer human answer definitely yes computer error human error rate question le likely case accident assumes responsibility
offchance two self driving vehicle crash could look data see car responsible happened assume company responsible
yeah would add lot legal liability company scale good number case want know waymo company accounted take step ameliorate
survey show people believe average driver think ok thinking appear fallen cognitive bias assumed driving skill symmetrically distributed average driver skill equal median driver skill sake argument say people people never crashed people one crash people two crash people three crash people four crash remaining driver crash respectively last two driver work crashresearch field participating destruction derby race weekend sum total crash average crash rate crash per person yet driver two le crash thus driver better average term crash group people without actually running number large enough sample size driver average unreasonable assertion anecdotal observation
nice made scenario especially like crash respectively last two driver work crashresearch field participating destruction derby race weekend lol joke
canieaturcarrots made scenario reason demonstrate issue using easy number fact assumption driving skill evenly distributed across population simply baseless assumption known statistical thing sort exist pretty common think second someone else pointed comment people ear average average number ear somewhere around due small number people one ear yet difference norm ear great among outlier skew average people
imagine someone hack
jessica sweety hotgirl vlogs hell hahaha
hackable tho
ad cant skipped ad built story thanks veritassium
hard self driving car see line arent theyre state repaints line fall mostly scraped snowplow winter ever paint road first place
autonomous vehicle likely run bad weather ive worked computer vision past year tell worst enemy weather ai model tend weird thing vision obstructed snow rain hail id imagine auto vehicle would detect bad weather stop functioning tell wait clear theyve picked phoenix testing phoenix az predictable weather importantly snow
fear job need money live people cant work way
becomes reality rip human driver job
rip human elevator driver job
sad far scroll find someone saying death caused human error lesser two evil universal basic income
know could invest public transportation rezoning make city livable grocery store bank work etc walking distance course america obsession car
rita yo check vid theyre like almost american infrastructure wasnt designed pedestrian afterthought
people involved texting watching tube driving
hell moving camera front seat
need delamaine service like cyberpunk
idk live city mean road worked given time usually month common road use line marker well selfdriving car drive road half tar missing line month year year thats city problem year road work usually another year road cracked nearly gravel cycle begin new
one talk job mean technology end driver especially bus truck mass land transportation sure driving job survive driver job eliminated
aaaaaaa cant wait actually cant stand human driver lol
interesting took elons example elevator used time use autonomous car waymos context waymo also relies lot accurate mapping vision street lot said claim really fully autonomous car
tech along realized definitely far fully autonomous ill keep driving
winter condition
onion selfdriving car isnt technological problem ethical one yes absolutely computer drive car take responsibility computer make mistake make mistake accident happens anyway fault nightmare labyrinth hypothetical legal issue people would rather simply deal human error likely least consequence human error known
waymo better tesla
main gripe autonomous vehicle feasibility orwellian use technology like elevator disable push button trap petty criminal moving scanner identify every individual street one heck tool hand government track political opponent already quite bad see big city plant camera everywhere like seoul korea road start hosting smart lidar radar freedom might become legend old
ive hearing technology fully autonomous vehicle law regulation arent probably biggest bottle neck adoption society
compare airplane flying highly regulated air space car ground thats like comparing apple rock really want passenger car hacker take control
prefer drive manual thanks
good
ideally youd even better wouldnt even need car youd take public transit autonomous vehicle train bus autonomous car specific destination whats even point owning car point city
worked system ninety mercedesbenz actually employed presented literally screamed got kicked fear loosing like business
dont need watch video tell yes probably many people drive worse autonomous car
topnews elevator movement also sideways thyssenkrupp made watch channel
prefer public transport like bus mrt car dont like car much care
scanning around million time second cant true
plane easy automate thing plane traffic air factor relatively easy predict change slowly like weather
also thats someone else job need taxi driver need work
nope gon na work congested road imagine waiting give way well wait forever unless take aggressive action jump small gap human make progress might annoy driver way get heavy traffic well perhaps car autonomous chance youd let one
sure already thought kind thing beyond
id interested see car deal questionable yellow light calculation stopping distance probable time yellow turn red vehicle close behind etc
pretty sure computer making calculation exact data better human judging feel
canieaturcarrots id hope would still interesting hear
elevator driver strike helped adoption driverless elevator go show showing general public world would like without always good idea make sure actually need first
yup uber taxi driver becareful going strike next year
feel like roast elevator driver lol
jjsplayground eventually happen without strike better get another job
bet lamplighter protested edison lightbulb would well learn adapt better
strike need preemptive earlier driverless elevator would still development theyd able score bigger victory ie written commitment employer adopt driverless elevator x number year course dont feel sorry ton taxi driving bus driving truck driving job switch automated well many decade retraining unskilled worker expected undergo
need car indian road
hope get soon last level im afraid level take much time point depend driver might longer know drive
autonomous car like need connection internet time go b gps sensor
really cant trust source video sponsored car type he reviewing
robot dumb unreliable human
spend time training ai car able recognize various sign stuff road actually designed driverless car would pointless could blast radio signal sign standardized protocal boom car recognize training required
even simpler setting road speed limit sign global database
joedavola cant quickly change
lienby
great seat beltis opposite personor reason
bay car anymore
fully autonomous vehicle double edged sword say something wrong vehicle whats say car wont lock door drive straight fema camp wrong think
imagine car get hacked
diving one life joy would rather robot luggage
dyanosis dont try think mate
thank france
test bangalore road
plane analogy kind greatest considering max grounding recent memory also complexity plane computer execute preprogrammed landing runway thats confirmed clear atc pale comparison complexity maneuvering vehicle busy city icy road agree driverless car future id seriously consider getting one become available personal use way approach issue seems like halfhearted attempt freshman write persuasive essay rather wellresearched considered stance ive come expect channel
think public transport would better almost every way guess im crazy cause everyone seems convinced video besides want share space dirty pleb
like invisible driver seatbelt
oh wish could attach image comment would rush market bazaar even crossroad india explain still plus year ahead come basically south asian country
let say man running across road suddenly car stop without hitting ai program delay get solution right may hit person undetectable bug software effect ride blue moon fate rider increase artificial intelligence someone may install virus hack system
one think selfdriving electric mass transit actual future however poorly executed extremely biased ad video little objective evaluation guy sell
reason dont like one someone else decide office car allowed drive basically house arresting someone distance
else thought city haunted saw alot kind car u young
awesome video fact sponsored make little le believable
said next year eventually illegal u drive car anonymous since human suck driving
humm wonder effect lidar pedestrian
technology currently pause functional lie imagine every k flight plane spontaneously crash known reason neural network suffer catastrophic forgetting try introduce novel variable overexperienced net happen scientist field
automatic pulling due siren deal broken
detected driver wanted criminal rerouting police station
unfortunately people rule rational come car sizable number mostly men see car extension taking pride strong fast pimped word manly car therefore manly driving basically cock fight fully autonomous car protected pimped afraid question time till someone try circumvent safety measure order fastest loudest impressive guy take traffic light
would never expect see channel
drive make prediction next driver behaviour based see possible predict driveless car behaviour doesnt human touch people crash test drive im curious manage intense traffic driver establish go first intersection
thats humanauto model flaw car autonomous talk
issue steering wheel also meaning people still control car mean somebody disliked google smthing would try crash car world crazy place must atleast person crazy enough
autonomous car become prominent world make million cab driver world wide unemployed notice said
yes million truck driver train conductor think ubi inevitable given current society make point
legend think car zombie apocalypse
hater end world
thing might perform well highway city specially indian city
wide road well marked good light little traffic totally flat understand good condition develop new technology live narrow winding road many place marking heavy truck tractor etc narrow road also snow ice water etc also quite understand work many time must drive day road parking lot free snow thats suv go shopping winter snow storm real challenge parking lot nightmare world computer manage
computer take information eye sens taking like normally driving road nap play game process data much faster computer also able better regardless road marking widespread
tokaisho seriously think local government spend money road marking people self driving car marking snow perhaps month year even local government shop etc live marking almost year managed got done marking also snowplough safe even marking disappears snowplough
tokaishoits actually easy condition thats technology isnt yet snow reduce contrast camera system causing sort problem tight road make autonomous car stop knowing
doncarlodivargas said absolutely nothing adding road marking
last part really interesting le people car nearest car automatically come potential change environment
sure self driving car u work technology still least year away jf consider normal road italy nation plus o deeply unconstitutional far knowledge go like half nation
totally agree europe like italy live think road built animal walking chaotic confusing understand computer manage especially night everything covered snow many place marking anything
auto driving seems smooth mean drive control perfectly still sure decision making safe release street concerned corner turn doesnt look like good making decision corner turn
thought yes driving cause human death accident removing steering wheel completely car weird technological advancement mathematics forget real joy driving human emotion associated driving mental stress relieving factor think option switch autonomous conventional like tesla vehicle combine fully autonomous capability ada system already gone past hearing roar turbocharged v electric motorsi completely support need hour must also take consideration intangible factor represented mathematically open reading view aiml
car available country an pls
good people need though
best driverless car race rigorous safety competition
enjoy hitting pedal feeling power
definitely gon na longer year shy british road lmao
mia mulder made amazing video answering one explaining quite bad idea really analysed intro talking map
bad idea need get away car altogether individual transport unsustainable always worse actual infrastructure
driverless car similar stage electric car year ago dont think driverless car commonplace road electric car also dont think possible driverless car road car enthusiast unless becomes illegal drive probably take better part year human driven car road
make fast furious movie except vehicle autonomous
fair enough counter point solar storm massive solar flare
would ruin almost every fueled vehicle road well
ibringitthefuckdown correct would advantage conscious driver manually apply brake ebrake thats good point though didnt bring
technology safely drive even gravel road blizzard probably possible within year danger car hacked probably worth would literally need disconnected internet make feasible
happens sensor fail also mean cant deliver pizza anymore
also car probably expensive af much cost get lidar repaired
love video incredibly incorrect imply computer better pilot flying computer fail time fyi il system talking land plane gusty condition
think idea full automated car type whether get possible le manual driver road feel like automated landing plane mostly possible level control even tiniest factor arent really factor unpredictable uncontrollable somehow remove human element road everything pretty static even worse weather would also allow vehicle road communicate vehicle without hiccup
waymo isnt going include person hit killed tempe safety data
uber
novah raise fundamental statistic question data include exclude system similar enough aggregate data different enough keep separate even tell difference guarantee insurance company extremely interested self driving car really safer cost le insure regular car much lower premium self driving much higher premium regular idea people shop around rate sort rational company occasionally underprice buy market share overprice try recoup loss theyre also pretty much irrational smart money isnt one way tell theyre really safer wait enough road real life compare insurance rate little careful two reason porsche cost insure volvo one porsche cost safety record case actually mean driver safety data indicates volvo little safer porsche accident data indicate volvo involved far fewer crash le damage self others porsche
burnout
feel like take long time infrastructure place actually safe car operate large scale
hardwired three law roboticseven trust man let alone silicon gallium arsenide human largely short sighted garbage loving parasite programming style reflect much
development could mean whatever saving benefit concentrated hand
problem hacker hacking tv signage display stop sign hazard short interval time computer able see
say rideronly vehicle nothing hidearent spouting marketing babble
people willing give ability drive also think pro race car driver need go fast dont understand every car autonomous sensor linked together could start really ramp speed travel road far safer mr vtec ever could
real question able get waymo drunk
happens driving skill regularly depend driverless car see getting anything worse occasion come need dive manual car dangerous driver youve become dependent autonomous car skill become compromised
way full pas
someone going hack vehicle like titan fall
neighborly bakery cranially talk singer ganguly behave delightful green amused venomous interest
many hgvs involved accident vehicle already driverless
issue autonomous vehicle isnt technology fact technology actually many year sure continually perfected mishap mishap autonomous vehicle far le regular vehicle autonomous vehicle safer regular vehicle getting safer issue government doubt development technology eventually lead government mandating use outlawing regular vehicle certainty government eventually outlawing vehicle burn fossil fuel see much government mandate fully supportive free market consumer make decision technology remained consumer choice level issue people choose whatever deem best government get involved thing get messed fast incentive get distorted good intention lead bad outcome reduction personal freedom almost always consequence thats dont like technology
im totally putting giant plush toy animal driver seat
drive speed limit even everyone else speeding adjust speed surrounding vehicle
going program car break law lol speeding stupid cause people die
canieaturcarrots transitionary period speeding cause people die
canieaturcarrots situation speeding safest option avoid accident certainly case speeding best option available example someone tailgating like foot away highway welcome texas going let say speed limit mph also welcome texas land mph speed limit addition youre rightmost lane car left matching speed nobody front youre boxed speeding come car onramp looking phone otherwise pating attention driving notice maintain current speed even speed limit person merging likely hit option hit break rearended possibly losing control car moving left sideswiping car hitting gas creating separation speeding would would hope speeding would calculus selfdriving car nessacary
im excited become widely available spend lot time afraid car even parked im scared careless distracted driver hitting somehow cant even practice driving anxiety caused car cause lock would dangerous happened real road people happen sooner aaaaa
yeah need way cull herd
bicyclist moment
derek basically become sandwich board gate google silicon valley guru believe technology save u problem created technology climate change traffic jam car accident fancy gadget dont tackle real issue need pound steel move pound human flesh car inefficient polluting dangerous whether electric selfdriving guess need keep shareholder car company happy
ayyy live probably saw lol
waymo experience
car ome autonimous thing would deal going go first interaction car interestingly would stop n argue woukd coin flip backend give input az go first

selfdriving car worse car probably car still pretty bad yes entire video love idea autonomous vehicle replacent car discussion need way broader amount car trafic city could replaced train subway light rail autonomous bus better city planning wider use bike place autonomous vehicle focussing heavily new technology fails completely see improvement could existing technology believe derek made video good faith believe checked every fact believe derek blinded idea new technology believe limited vision future video present serf interest tech company good pr team believe derek made ad
louder people back
sorry autonomous aircraft nothing autonomous car plane doesnt plane around irrational pilot
outrageous scarecrow biosynthetically wrestle tune contextually succeed wholesale physician alike faint fair deal
im motorcyclist im terrified scenario im surrounded clunky automated car human driver already bad enough
car person im excited finally feel safe road knowing blonde teenage girl doorless jeep arent gon na crash zx
driverless car cool id much rather see investment public transit car even electric car way future
transportation get cheaper become subscription service end paying le bonus point pay extra unlock new destination
one way ticket constant surveillance state
already case
direverless car interface know ahead time mile
still think itd better le need car like walkable city stuff like would much le individualist option probably benefiting people long run
bicycle train
yes exactly self driving car people putting car road fixing traffic bad outcome driving parking may le issue empty car road horrible congestion
sir based urbanist
car going city inside city think need car
long there answer going jail someone get killed thanks
answer insurance like normal car accident
panner hahahahaha good luck suing multibillion dollar company friend kill someone go prison pay bill
might better development prioritized driverless bus instead car reduces need mass production increase accessibility people physically financially
think work driverless car work even better driverless bus truck developing first doesnt exclude latter im pretty sure transportation company would happy excange human driver automatical system dont get tired make much mistake need required rest stop refueling vehicle course thats bad people loosing job look serious accident caused tired truck driver would better u leave automation
shinta totally agree exclusive term production see consumerist society emphasis may placed slightly selling car instead public transportation would nice see government try invest technology hybrid bus pretty common originally developed car hopefully wont lag far behind car industry either
hate going bus lot people act like trash bought car wanted go wanted wanted without interact people want car prioritized x
michaeldeathhunter may people difficult deal bus public space service bus absolutely necessary people live place like nyc difficult dense city car investment better bus important
kevinchiang except doesnt essential driverless car car could drop immediately outside door pick door spend rest time driving around picking taxi fare need spend time parked
pedestrian accident hit stationary car thats hilarious
know grocery store made correctly wouldnt hire employee robot could get grocery using technology like could come house go walmart walmart employee pick grocery
phoenix profile everone using bus train plain get around ah life
american truck suv small pp apeal
feel like eliminating human driver changing autonomous car best way reduce car accident
know could reduce car
agree lot said potential autonomous car one point dont agree traffic improving know increasing throughput doesnt improve traffic adding lane always end increasing traffic example nowadays traffic caused mostly amount people forced drive whenever step outside front door stand need fundamentally restructure living space traffic improve maybe autonomous car allow highly efficient easytouse car sharing service might reduce number car stuck parking lot diminish amount space take car living space overall doubt impact traffictrip duration think idea autonomous car could reduce traffic stem north american car culture north america reliance car unless live dense major city center like nyc need car basically everything
hi derek learned something new video appreciate however bit disappointed video onesided failed mention issue bottleneck research thirdparty independent people topic especially watching video research wrong wouldve wished put objectivity making sponsored video
he sandwich board gate google owns waymo point
needy behavior arguably include passenger booly lie absent fantastic oven flashy shivering whorl
construction
someone drive eye sight would love selfdriving car
comparing plane autopilot self driving apple orange comparison
repeated claim million mile experience bit misstated sure human achieve im willing admit probably safer average human driver achieve got ta give shout human needing many mile become competent driver human bit smarter require le training
fun fact sustainability future private motor vehicle ownership driving people option environmentally speaking estimated billion car world even technology get cheaper estimate cost retrofit car self driving technology see cost high driverless technology come fruition build infrastructure competing ai different car increase problem lower last point would sell company tech company model earnings marketing money get inside one fantastic car window screen non stopping commercial tailored like fb google service face recognition privacy take another dump post somewhat sarcastic honesty pipe dream big kind saying bad idea whole execution self driving atm biggest b around
think driverless vehicle great choice moving forward one caveat though idea changing vehicle autonomous prohibiting real people behind wheel hacking standpoint freedom standpoint able mechanically control vehicle oneself scary autonomous driving fairly resilient software im sure program written give power leave others powerless decentralization critical theme must observed tech world
great choice walkable city bike public transport self driving car fancy gadget dont tackle real issue car absurd dangerous wasteful way move people around
googlewaymo got money worth ad
wouldnt want driverless car hacker
wouldnt want driveless car pollution gas noise traffic jam
thats sunny california road prick try new york winter india anytime hongfckinkong top
judy yo check vid gps working energy transfer le bluetooth never work
thought bit dismissive ethic critique dont think people making ethical critique saying automated car bad shouldnt used fact accident arent killing guy helmet versus guy without helmet wholly irrelevant problem whether automated car safer automated car scenario legal liability fall etc important question even come time million accident u per year even automated car avoid thats event year responsibility accident ethical decision program car make going relevant
arent ready type ethical concern people dont solution make flip coin give random chance based poll population would instead trying find right answer make mimic human behavior
sorestlor unfortunately though legal system doesnt operate arbitrary decision like entity responsible making car going want legally liable accident
nowadays im sure regaining bunch time really implies feeling happier yeah guess selfdriving card would bring cool new future
nope mean even productive
day driving saw another driver lane looking phone texting able predict going veer lane slowed dont think computer able empathize driver even see inside vehicle one many flaw current self driving approach
make eye contact driver
lol trash watching oh ad
really dont want driverless car want control dont want entire life controlled big tech want doesnt want enough enough
feel control drive everywhere around someone life city doesnt need car feel free anyone plan expedition trip buy milk store look bigger picture car whether selfdriving problem
blank solution problem genuine freedom tied follow someone else timetable route go whenever want go wherever please car speed safety security think many people would getting robbed knifed raped car rather strolling around foot sarah everard driving rather walking fateful night shed alive
go jail car kill pedestrian
passenger car traveled trillion mile u million accident million good weather autonomous vehicle operate today assuming happened passenger car roughly mile drivenaccident waymo latest autonomy test california reported milesdisengagement disengagement mean human teleoperator intervene avoid accident current technology alone improve x even would match human sensor resolution silicon still matching human apparatus self driving going better cruise control fact properly designed advanced cruise control shown reduce accident rate highway lot money thrown self driving still need sensing technology breakthrough likely next gen chip image sensing match human eye resolution light capture beware hype surrounding company
make drive india
awesome
self driving bus austria girl jumped front banned self driving car
disliked video advertisement
conform belong whats problem driverless car safety alway come freedom expression conform belong
trust pretty much long waived responsibility happens get car use autonomous driving system
yeah yeah put portsmouth london liverpool edinburgh watch crash software crash
rainbow bubble warm climate happens snow afraid drive speed limit keeping speed limit worrying black ice condition unpredictable solve unpredictable
tech might gon na race shitbox highway computer wont speed
love living future
dont
driver like travel great however video posted website showed autonomous vehicle driving along clear road like sunset boulevard want see avoiding falling tree post avoiding multiple hole road driving along slippery road also want know another vehicle went oneway street autonomous vehicle travelling drive back try avoid
car went rouge
trust car people fully trust going wait every one get kind car
people seem realize tech holding u back driverless vehicle mainstream mainly politics infrastructure development slowed politics
change everything cant wait see imagine future anyone owns car mobility service car communicating new traffic light creating hive mind optimizing traffic
anyone owns car ready endless traffic jam car thing past way forward
blank noone sorry mean great car sharing
would never life set foot elevator without driver
worried safe
ready
wowww want come today amazing would million time better someone like extreme social anxiety real driver might act weird try talking somethings
privileged thing say weird doesnt make people deserve lose job
show people stupid
honestly hope world car dont want drive two year taking driving lesson still didnt feel fully comfortable
yeah try india
incredible dorothy ganguly prepare mail maternally approve abaft distinct india pink youthful shoulder
would much rather faulty human removed roades could fully embrace technology
would much rather useless wasteful polluting car removed road
blank focusing bigger picture factory truck plane car least called polution
idea electrical energy cost induced heavy computation inclusind ai every mile done autonomous mode
horrible idea driverless vehicle
think idea driverless vehicle work well american especially larger town city due road design many large generally straight line however look home country scotland road design would make exceptionally difficult program technology cope road generally straight often small road marking also larger town city still contain year old cobble road ive yet see autonomous vehicle used scotland may wrong though would love see find technology fascinating
really like people compare driverless elevator driverless car immediately tell either mental disability b paid mentally disabled
roundabout yet
selfdriving car could perfect million feel uncomfortable simply rebel adopt transition social battle
social battle people dont care
blank think every person ever saw stomping imaginary brake yelling stop arent driving imagine like one need driver seat go nut
see many problem autonomous driving software engineer driving last year without accident daily commuting find hard believe software run year without issue hand consider cautious foreseeing driver many others driving like maniac reckless driver would get autonomous driving probably would help
know stop designing city rely car ownership way dont drive neither reckless driver
really fun fact fully autonomus car eventually get replaced people like driving forced go place made driving like want see animal go zoo want practice shooting go shooting range
already horse riding
blank nothing
thank pointing nonsense ethical dilemma fed
well autonomous car make million cab driver throughout world unemployed becomes prominent world notice said
malleshgowda fewer people die traffic
henriklantzhedstrom mentioned million people unemployed didnt expect anyone defend reply give fewer people die traffic people loosing livelihood nonsense ethical dilemma million people would loose source living think traffic moral code
malleshgowda point referring phoney ethical dilemma hit person accident
make transportation cheaper efficient virtually hassle using thats ill buy bike get around smaller area sell car hate using car
absolute king bike way forward
give train shuttle bus specialized hot tub vehicle car day get car road finally make human transportation efficient
control speed make stop turn back
changed city way car necessity anymore option
seems like theyre deeply invested car culture cant even imagine anything else
cant wait driverless get away vehicle
ask wonder still allowed drive manually
yikes unemployment professional driver going big crisis
oh give job dont require sit hour hour
blank
cant drift useless
wasnt optimistic selfdriving autonomous vehicle begin make excellent point benefit undeniable
really paradox thing system needed make autonomous car become reality wont necessary anymore every car drive autonomous transition real challenge every car communicates every car task driving becomes much easier security different topic though
security privacy surveillance hard fought discussion
yep concern always side safety network system n cause live world machine hacked well network matter time someone find exploit weak point car us em whatever decide even concern based skepticism paranoia real possibility thats enough keep usintrusting em atleast often
kryfruity problem many people worried death part death would drive youre car drive bye self
part life missed spelled
dont want car connected internet
horn work anymore unfortunately
yes part problem though good condition good condition may well different simulation bunch car moderate traffic real emergency problem friend certainly nobrainer system car keep lane lock reasonable speed apply brake automatically get close obstacle another car tech exists placewith driver able return manual case emergency automation wonderful highlyconvenient shouldnt remove ability control outcome want suspend thats one thing give submit situation regardless play need go far good condition great also dont always happen arent predictable computer wont account deliberate move programmed behavior roomba nifty sort tool automatically clean floor anything cant account go wrong thing go badly performance computer passive safety concern observance traffic law driver aggressive cut corner traffic law may invoke road ragejust give brief idea potentially misfire situation rude driver want get moveon six seven driver behind want go first theyre going first youre automatic car may keep locked traffic long time technology year extent doesnt belong pilot seat keep copilot best like movie airplane
ah yes hour day eye arent glued screen let replace nothing look screen
look window read book talk friend car look eye talking lol
problem mixing human driver year avoided ten crash couple potentially fatal caused human stupidity sort incident ai would never able avoid isnt good human improvising id feel safe driving together autonomous car road though probably annoyed congestion safer driving stupid human id respect give space knowing isnt infalible would still contain thousand bug code knowing human wouldnt respect could put situation wasnt programmed deal imagine pedestrian knowing autonomous car would stupidly think jaywalk trusting car going stop highway causing havoc traffic
loss employment taxi industry destroyed ton job automation always come cost
invented way hire ghost drive car
test india passed itll need approval safety
like idea wasted potential car currently exist finding way add system like older vehicle cheaper option would make technology much easier adapt
becomes reality best case scenario human driving becoming sport
ummmm already sport called racing called monster truck driving called destruction derby etc
thrawl mean wont anything sport throwing spear sport used hunting method people perform sport
yes driving yet another pleasure denied brave new world
daevaskye car would ride horse around go place denied riding horse
thrawl racist
part world mean self driving success drive without road marking take decission based rule breaking driver
said car handle thing confidence ease biggest sticking point feel like majority accident caused people confident driving panicking
im crazy car decide life dy two vehicle collide
yea im worried whether machine better driving im worried humansgovernments better hacking machine fending hacker
dont think autonomous car going feel like elevator think autonomous car going feel like stepping train metro tram even driver dont really think often dont see
driverless train copenhagen front train giant windownever think twice anymore
used feeling automatic elevator train invisible driver thats exposed child werent exposed driverless car child dont instinctive reassurance parent wouldnt let u get dangerous vehicle learn adult driverless car safe requires resisting decade experience contrary grandchild never understand big deal
yeah u want le auto car public transport still wasteful
alot metro driverless
arent going towards walle
nice step future around harsh condition like foggy mountain road south east asian city road including countryindia people interested breaking traffic rule anything driving sudden decision intuition skill highly doubt vehicle high level sense traffic rule protection could even move competitive road let alone keeping efficiency would love see tested though
people dont understand every single car autonomous chance accident drop massively car talk make decision way ahead greater distance human want driverless car road within yr le accident le car needed road le car faster travel time due lack congestion better environment le waste le resource walking area changing side parking lane cyclistsscootersskateboarderroller bladers instead etc cheaper ride short distance long term rideshares dont need driver license get aroundpeople unable drive go place easier save self money insurancepetrolchargingparts cost vehicle ownership turn garage bedroom fun room etc parking lot become housing spacesparksbuildings
driverless car going need entirely new infrastructure system internet connection added safety communicate car road g rfid chip microprocessor imbedded road cool new infrastructure bill started laying groundwork driverless car
problem concept problem know corporation attempt donot thrilled think
anything thing holding back bad infrastructure live cant even imagine car inept road maintenance though guess software could learn handle bad road nonetheless area good infrastructure see easily used snowy area heated road thing etc
getting tense environment need quiet place think let say mom dad fighting yelling interrupting study call car take calming ride keep studying call check tell doubtful theyll objection better taking walk mindful everything sitting outside roof secondfloor bedroom degree safety concern even insect disturb well rough day work tell car drive around bit take home even park somewhere quiet bit technology wild whole hit person v person scenario decent ask likely going issue ever make curious another statistic dont see website average top speed entire fleet per city region state top speed small enough area region doubt software ever need make decision like shown wouldnt better know highest topspeed area youll traveling mph lower insane much look consider great video thank mental workout
johnny cab coming soon city near
soits driven mile still hasnt passed driver test take away
get aircraft land automatically cant get airline pilot use modern gps let alone next generation lidarguided traffic management system dont think well allautonomous traffic generation think technology one big problem human going need elevator operator strike cross barrier
ida question perhaps let say elderly passenger get car halfway destination elderly man get heart attack press help button companycar say take ambulance minute reach man car stop wait car drive normally meet ambulance minute preferred option follow question scenario ambulance doubled distance car stop min till ambulance man dead car go normally meet ambulance half way minute still dead would specific scenario autonomous vehicle would allowed go speed limit meet ambulance equally fast ambulance meeting im really curious
really want driverless car soon anything someone driving year two would love see autonomous vehicle get place safely there le risk car accident like shown since autonomous car would able avoid perfectly
dont mind autonomous car premise flawed billion mile experience mean possible scenario accounted real human deal unknown scenario several time better piece trained software
self driving car wont gain significant market share there enough car collision sensor car collision sensor actively avoiding also senior get certain age take driving test every year cuz theyre definitely going last group embrace self driving car
drive crowded city critical accidentes happen bike pedestrian everywhere count dude dont want drive driving street pleasure care
error impossible machine make hahahahaah eat waymo burger way xd call scientific dude machine fail unpredictable happens said first nyc rush hour san francisco rush hour ride talk count accident count accident happening near waymo car would truth accident happening around waymo car one caused waymo car weighted amount car seen talk
another error lidar tell moar interference multiple lidar different brand busy road
audrey youd prefer killed driverless car ok rage exist anyway rage driving people anxious inside de car imagine cant control
jumpy asia ontogenically pour save contrarily man via recondite tray determined level amusement
waymos accident mile thats accident every mile would every year driving good driving record imho especially given waymo doesnt drive big city freeway craziness concur av getting better given typical technology road map effort still going year hit critical mass road technical hurdle come insurance company fault hurdle
im scared selfdriving car im scared human driver le car road could communicate id feel hell lot safer one human unpredictable
high quality interesting content thanks
everyone quick talk bad average driver agree nobody seems want change average virtually requirement get driver license u get license retesting requalification requirement law change nobody required demonstrate even know law exist forget understanding complying many people want computer hold hand safety take away another piece mean human take away autonomy literally give machine
keep thinking would happen someone get heart attack inside one
k dislike testosteron addict feel manly drive least mph speed limit
big issue though matter good cant beat cost shitbox
shouldnt want driverless car ridiculous
didnt answer philosophical question though maguy
im worried hacker potentially sabotaging sort technology

exactly
good question
gathered billion mile experienced addressed
look tesla full self driving bit might seem bit rough first thats show everything especially failure waymo obsolete quickly please try prove wrong year
best vehicle safety improvement eliminate nut behind wheel
ive always said something similar point made video autonomous car certainly better bad driver maybe even average driver dont know ever better really good driver think implemented properly could net positive long dont ever try take away ability drive car im fully board
dont think enough experience even small majority operating road elsewhere think bias sponsored waymo think enough data studied understand driverless car ready convinced
cant wait get automated car take long distance trip basically fancy land train please seriously would great freedom mobility car luxury riding cabin like train lay sleep mini bar snack think would require electric car could stop recharge knowing could take automated car would take basically anywhere want go could run say hour simply press button need restroom snack something find nearest option let select stop get thing get back away go would take lot stress vacation
unfortunately driving money one remaining job automation take happen worker im capitalism ready get board universal basic income
individualsmallgroup public transport probably something would nevertheless ideally reduced much achieve real transportation efficiency intelligent bus train bulk work car minivan taking people finegrained destination rather people car automated realistic notion jetsons flying car mention bicycle time conventional one actually exercise since overweight bad one health fuel efficiency environment
want far better public transport car anyways would solve problem car intermediate shuttle service theyve become dominant form transport said still vital incredible engineering
cat cc caption typed cat
posting intent watching video answer isto one faulty sensor away accident chance stop
im technology innovation concern automation autonomy start killing large segment employment im long haul trucker state ive mixed thought autonomous truck one could potentially safer numbskulls mega carrier willing hire train day hand fully autonomous truck would eliminating field employment know go industry well like retail fastfood customer service hot line factory ect job going left keep incorporating autonomy society
mean real concern dont mean belittle wont happen overnight gradual change word saboteur come french shoe sabot luddite threw wooden clog automatic loom used punched card make pattern cloth punched hole card first type computer programming technology spawn new technology job said think driverless car never going thing responsible crash happens event witnessing accident would driverless car unload load cargo paperwork etc need human manual overhaul essential im convinced
sosolidn usually technology spawn new job autonomous technology kill way job spawn freed manpower cant use colonialimperialist warfare like last couple time dont see beneficial unless first mover find way deal undesirable population
youtube channel called cgp grey video autonomous vehicle found insanely high amount workforce would jobless automatic vehicle get used wonder whats gon na happen day eventually come
biosquid point wont day itl v gradual
sosolidn matter losing amount job huge deal whether take month year employment long term thing
mentioned car life spent parked community owned privacy first autonomous vehicle sound great however owned company sell data conduct experiment u micro personality change
follow traffic guard thats standing middle intersection directing traffic
wonder traffic death car big bsod windshield thats kind coupled kind futuristic transparent screen controllable oppacity car fine sudden dum instrument pop break multiple window wind shield start popping saying something resulted error needed close close button greyed cant even pressed
get driverless traffic nonexistent since majority traffic manmade unnecessary braking paying attention traffic light etc
like concept dont think mandatory even take stricter driving test still want able drive technology like would eliminate lot kind racing
problem safety making vulnerable google
standard driver see every day would replace yall driverless car given option
yeah million taxi driver fired work many people make money driving car make money afford expense pay bill care
feel like biggest problem selfdriving car cant communicate pedestrian make judgment call like human u see handicap sticker car give leniency whatever wave pedestrian across crosswalk plus vehicle equal vehicle follow rule ie road rage would driverless car respond doesnt seem reliable better human maybe let real thats hard
impression one biggest roadblock citywide rollout would issue liability insurance serious accident happens driver liable service company strange wasnt addressed
wait stage autonomy right far know reached second stage
dont feel comfortable sponsored video
cost biggest reason wont seeing self driving car road time soon
elevator driver oh sweet baby jeebus take old geezer elevator operator ebil grin
thing ive always liked thought everyone self driving car learnt drive realised actually enjoy driving many others make really unlikely everyone self driving would make self driving car safe
love idea self driving vehicle think problem driver actually driving
longtime high school beyond aviation person ive explaining many people regarding automated car weve seen elevator train tram aircraft others car aviation super safe part due automation driver infrastructure suck largely due human error ive experienced autoland flight may didnt know know automation used whenever possible free workload pilot focus task know shortly takeoff possibly landing roll plane control autoflight system even takeoff roll normally autothrustautothrottle complexity driving doesnt affect flight much many manually driven car matter good automation get still humandriver error nonautomated vehicle every vehicle automated would better need light stop sign speed limit etc assuming automated control
truck driver year say without doubt cant wait till car fully autonomous course ill retired much safer system travel everyone
nobody talking privacy everything digital computer company government know
location already know people location
future company open huge facility housing complex employee autonomous car drive employee work supermarket onsite get grocery go home work
looking tesla confused moon yellow light im sure want maybe year breakthrough sure
preference would public transport urban planning render majority car journey nonexistent worry many pinning hope automated driving vehicle solve traffic issue never road capacity build traffic generate car least efficient way move people around city city city adopt stance grudging acceptance private motor vehicle always seeking way accomplish journey without car reasonable solution possible thats grudging acceptance come becomes win time car ill back moment
there name nirvana fallacy fallacy solution isnt viable workable simply isnt perfect nothing going perfect long marked improvement currently least considered said still lot work regarding law surrounding selfdriving car eg selfdriving car kill someone whose fault think reward worth new problem wed take
selfdriving car kill someone whose fault dead person fault actually already happened case jaywalker killed uber selfdriving car way inconvenient moneyed politicallyconnected interest pushing sd car allow fault assigned anyone human involved
one best part driverless car becoming mainstream car really fault software engineer fix bug weakness sure somebody might fired responsibility know fact never happen normal crime guilty party sent jail doesnt stop people around world committing crime software hand set standard company software end making world safer one person find flaw fix
videopipeline self driving car kill anyone want
boiimcfacto want make world safer place stop relying car daytoday transportation selfdriving car way avoid rethinking urban planning move around
alexmackay yes many people planet self driving car target idiot give car enough time react
really hope youre making sponsored video company personally agree believe
ha he youtuber probably doesnt dont bank good people best interest mind may seem way thats make trust
crackpotpolitics username coincidence seems
willch stay charicter
fun game something malfunction
rider im
route pre planned absolute liberty choose destination
yeahhumans future incredibly helpless
like one gilmore girl episode got hit deer
thinking back drunk driver driver dont get enough sleep asshole driver general ai driven car safer gon na efficient traffic whole ai run problem irrelevant would make le accident first place fact wider traffic awareness compared see whats front back side whole traffic would move like puzzle ai make way outofcontrol car coordinate whole lot car yelling adjacent driver practice driving day without rest compare professional driver whore still susceptible tiredness stuff ai doesnt even learn scratch new driverless car install experienceskill ai improve
im nyc im real intrigued would handle busy non well manage road manhattan
like people longer drive fun like driving would simply hobbysport instead necessity
public transport please pain
way handled covid pandemic also show one final thing people also notoriously bad taking responsibility perhaps hold u back dont visceral understanding hold accountable autonomous driving there single person one could point say fault
wish talked snow video considering number major city deal every year fact testing seems taking place area receive little none seems believable technology still way
ronald absolutely many place world agree people saying better human driver mistake see making assuming itll eventually better mean good enough
batchest well yes completely trust trashlas ai make life death decision crash scenario batchest
wow waymo lev tesla taking note
question going like taxi service still driver seat
hard brake tradition
people like drive however would great medical application helping people get appointment
oversimplification cause asiana airline flight crash paired ominous music manipulative cant fully trust say rest video potentially video well
problem car video new owner high end german car know happens couple decade
car able understand policeman signaling like crash site car drive road marking stuff like
dont want
technology revolution innovation
worried loss uber driver addition increase selfcheckout technology seeing recently
think see lidar bulky efficient etc early ibm computer use soon think itll teeny tiny
really hope take people love driving know id still want actually drive awhile
automated car hacked human cant anyway great way transport youre tired drunk like horse old day
sorry purely shilling cant trust whether framing issue genuine youre paid say technology car doesnt change inefficient form transportation luxury cost community government society environment hyping safer doesnt make good idea wish could look past leap logic needed agree youve presented think dangerously misleading mainstream science channel like inject shoddy corporate content datastream convince people problem solved proprietary tech last video watch
may seem like good idea public transport especially anything rail literally efficient way get people b one person using car isnt problem everybody using sure autonomous car solution problem urban planning created th century neglecting public infrastructure
make attractive remove structure human condition add bench front existing one place small table four armchair serve cold beer let passenger play truco
driverless car become ubiquitous people feel safer wonder design feature set change time firefly great example dashboard steering wheel transmission control could extra space repurposed ive seen couple concept car swiveling seat allow passenger face commute non personal vehicle probably also go similar change bus might look like symmetrical pill drive equal dexterity forward backwards like zoox autonomous wheeler seen logan movie might also soon become reality itll also interesting see definition owning car change line personal vehicle public transportation begin blur would people even need car calling autonomous rideshare quick would even safe drive manually road driverless vehicle use cloud weave mere inch apart traffic blistering speed might bit hang car enthusiast dont think recreational driving car modding going anywhere scope drive hellcat l swapped volkswagen bus might shrink quite bit anyway pour immediate thought watching
get older technology give hope future point wont able drive anymore u population dont live near safe timely public transit system still need get around
consider build better public transit system
think autonomous driving save accident death car accident wait vehicle open public definitely get one company selling vehicle buy
who shooting footage driver seat
dont think wise put ai many car control one company doesnt seem safe
ive said year reason dont driverless car standard many human driver big restriction never ability car control ability car predict brainless ape around might
think one reason people hesitant driverless car compared autopilot plane dealing uncertainty car road etc dont think anyone problem car going b
may make road safer travel deploying autonomous system unfortunately save humanity stupidity
trust autonomous car average driver know average driver emotional attention span need rest take uncalculated risk
shouldnt want driverless car driver
would definitely trust car human develop consciousness start questioning purpose relation maker
derek car pull side road hears sirenes preparing future criminal common car gon na help police arrest easily wont even let enjoy chased like bad guy
actually im always looking mirror surrounding vehicle time rutinary im also really aware blind spot vehicle check need changing line many time there car mirror almost side yes radar camera give constant monitoring course better awareness surroundings speed limit distance car give huuge room error talking experience critic situation involved front car crashing one front issue maintained safe distance didnt even brake hurry
handle tornado
hate noncar enthusiast changing industry
driverless car dont solve many issue create invest public transport video basically add derek
wait till kill kid wont cute
goal le car green space take look netherlands city design beautiful youtube bike give good harsh example
see people trusting appreciating advancement autonomous driving see already expected trust give control bunch sensor camera maybe technology implemented f type car put track beat time f driver take corner faster us le fuel make perfect lap show regular man improvement give control receive accomplish
dont worry infant mortality coming
automation kind inflexible call technophobic dont care accumulator software error hardware fault unexpected event id rather suffer human mistake human compensate unusual event
one saying perfect human make mistake frequently
davidharris problem another human compensate error one car go around try fix spot happens automated network suffers error stop add sensor malfunction oftendirt improper maintenance etc dead kid massive damage car possibly structure dead traffic jam year road obstacle invisible road marking fallen tree obstacle ai cant drive icesnow winter automatically answer automation still dont want car hacked terrorist control ai thats another fear develop ai fat without thinking fastthousands operation per second grow beyond human control rewrite go internet forever cant shut internet impossible
potential criticism think freak incident small object flying towards car malfunction like rock launched whatever malfunction im referring brake failure damage sensor maybe rock remedy would clearly define safety procedure depth system diagnosis use
car want restore better able havent waited long nothing design different type fuel minimal harmful exhaust gas make new fuel demand cheaper gas even still use gas make gas high priced try deter ir reduce amount drive old car leave u alone
built good public transport efficient autonomous car critically important go full tilt climate apocalypse whole video honestly feel like advertisement waymo quite disgusting watch
""
future
small animal deer something falling sky inclement weather iced road heavy snow rain
kinda sad future many people even know drive
guess technology dont need everyone personal car anymore question many car need average number people size neighborhood
said ridesharing increased traffic way ensure dont need personal car make transport car required
still believe driving car elevator inherently different course autopilot il landing heavy fog pilot pretty much useless youre kind landing realize someone something landing strip autopilot way knowing crash straight autonomous vehicle dont cross vehicle path pretty much safe go problem dealing road unpredictability stupid driver sudden change velocity roadworks clearly marked hard read road sign one course look pretty good far see might try would take time get used
pedestrian walk cross street car see potential future many survive car one
see people crossing road everywhere stopping every car fun see people using siren troll car rare happen see video internet
entire video one mention tesla
think biggest reason illogical fear almost people know part car actually work would trust blackbox life long driver know human know operate machine thus feel safer
interesting commercial hope programmer considered every situation reality offer autonomous car dont either drive surely find way react happens oh new nvidia update coming maybe patch fix crippling graphic driver bug someone made mistake programming guess bet people think average programmer
want good public transport
think like le lack control tell company arent gon na programming thing take certain road time allow certain stop safety concern etc oh influx amazon delivery truck x freeway well route traffic freeway instead wouldnt want pleb slowing delivery maybe first guy know google map something like update awhile back even expense giving shortest route family going trip taking car caravan point google map decided route car thru freeway particular reason split u freeway made u like minute late v car driving would followed car stick together driver point decided follow map least choice car would go route plea choice part
problem cyber attack way cgp grey video ignores human wanting cross road
itll also force u maintain road infrastructure plus
maintaining increasing road infrastructure bankrupting american city everywhere reduce reliance upon road infrastructure
could eliminate parking lot add green space city massively improve public transport right yknow
self driving car mediocre stopgap fundementally flawed transportation system
disappointing
derek trolling long time subscriber responded comment loyal group nearly million suscribers youve made mistake fed load misinformation say say recommend watch rob maurer james douma interview explains google miss
problem may occur pedestrian attain level confidence car wonder across road whenever like knowing car stop least risking though
obvious question going happen job would human waste year life learning every system airplane work fly robot take away job would person spend k saving robot take whats going happen job everyone afford become doctor people still supposed live robot way better
terrible driver cant afford chauffeur dream
well technology make work expensive expensive much car advertised autonomous dont capability driver even wondered tesla bad autonomous driving make mistake human would see even le human thats problem lidar radar required see typical driver best different wavelength used lidar radar let make better mapping example lidar mistaken simple mirror radar mistaken material visible light exactly radar obviously cant simple camera thats people still dont trust dont believe done right tesla show u right using camera without radar lidar make car see much human could course better math monitor camera lack intelligence case driving truck trailer looked like sky even better traffic light detection distinguish yellow light moon thats much people dont believe time autonomous vehicle dont technology technology proposed insufficient let ask question would fly autonomous airplane bought aliexpress discount
became disabled year started driving life completely changed little personal freedom agency something like could make seriously wonderful impact life would start using tomorrow please let get major funding government approval
test car indian road
thing truly want anything else autonomous driving every car accelerating rate stop light amount time billion would save simply removing reaction time whether preoccupied selfie changing radio general synapse mind boggling time undefinable every person life yet defines every person level automation may require vehicle speak say accelerating m even would genuinely great time road even le often
show looked future dr michio kaku said self driving mesh networked vehicle could stop speeding intersection highway speed inch vehicle flying past
could invest public transportation symptomatic american car culture didnt dumb zoning witb suburb shopping center instead mixed use development center walk anywhere need distance connected train everything would many time easier automobile industry want think self driving car future theyre public transportation better urban planning future
audi experimenting idea car connected within network catch call green wave system called green light optimized speed advisory glosa pretty similar suggested
still keep bigger distance next vehicle driving v standing least still human driver human driver trafic light go anyway
waymo car ai best driver world indian road hold pothole
day everyone driverless autonomous vehicle siri interacts may understand say driver like race around street showboat illegal maneuver pull emergency stop button restart without something reset emergency stop caused accident responsible police pull driverless vehicle legally intoxicated influence autonomous vehicle old fart like go slow want go manual amongst rest traffic autonomous two autonomous vehicle crash one fault would responsible injury would road rage look like self driving car system everything completely monitored public privacy cost upkeep lidar radar sensing technology government cost adapt roadway autonomous vehicle power source vehicle x v priuses hp mercedes luxury economy model
car drive beyond phoenix train car every city aint happening year
autonomous car biggest issue tesla overselling capability charging people beta test program either need direct customer failing system stand offer free crowd sourced data collection statistically still safer normal driver still make mistake human wouldnt make
pull siren sense lot trolling future
lot fine troll police sir video audio lidar using fake siren
napucco speaker drone
joeblow ok ok put much effort trolling deserve get away xd
napucco futuristic problem require futuristic solution
assume instead listening sound try see come would even area stop detect absolute position test actually vehucle alternatively server sending signal car informing road warning like
solar flare knock electronics car pileup
mean end russian dash cam im
finally good counter argument
improbable car hit scenario people who education philosophy ended trolly problem
reek corporate propaganda know driverless car almost certainly future liked part video discussing rest video felt like car commercial id rather hear debate surrounding driverless car immediately dismissing real flaw bettering public transportation solve lot problem driverless car trying answer
thats great even airplane pilot technology failsafe happens wont much choice brace impact
video sponsored company recommended love video normally dont lot faith amount literal advertisement
autonomous vehicle nonautonomous infrastructure always challenging driver philosophy ai human completely different easier safer reliable cheaper create sub infrastructure specifically designed autonomous vehicle
sure let add radiation city cant get enough
id love see theyre addressing trolley problem always fully agreed public road driverless vehicle would effectively end fatality congestion nobrainer punintended already happened considering theyre already godtier level demonstrates system run world hopelessly antiquated dinosaur ironically need replaced streamlined combination ai algorithm something like humanist emeritocracy mass order quickly effectively respond everfaster rate change every aspect life revolution ensure fastest humanism centred scientific technological progress possible instead capitalism progress profitable holding back think ip copyright patent law etc
think time driverless car happen know human error large part car accident software test engineer also understand human make software drive vehicle make large number mistake writing code also know business make decision cut cost make deadline may mean le testing product human error shifted bit

im excited autonomous racing car
service elevator nyc main building elevator driver
im support might driver road someday lol
driverless car like smoke smoke albeit window
mean want go b fine go full autonomous car could sleep play game ever like drive sometimes go autonomous car everyone go could get rid stop light stuff car communicating
maybe one day people new jersey able pump gas
convinced thank
imagine world nobody need car anymore itll subscription based service like software pay per month car pick morning school work return home tired distracted driver traffic almost accident parking lot theyre use go plug somewhere waiting next job would radical change environment advent automobile perhaps love car would happily give lead better life
system youre talking already exists except monthly pass typically cheaper called functional light rail system remove automotive lobby return city designed around humanity
jessehunter rail doesnt show right door case fact based personal observance parking lot suburban train station packed car everywhere southern california live canada commuter get automobile height winter rather freezing dangly bit waiting bustrainsubway choose use mass transit either cant afford car parking fee associated drive wherever commute shortest parking free also job need vehicle time per day various errand mass transit wont work alternative far slow drive subscription based service could call car door minute bringing destination could host parameter well going minute le stop vehicle wait longer would hail another one would mass transit cant use mass transit also would great equalizer infirm aged
lwizzit im legally blind purpose driving double vision use car account system seem perfect right rideshare already exists suffers problem car public transportation needed
yeah would rather car normal people driving since much safer know whats better replacing every car new autonomous one public transportation
correct increased availability use public transportation best traffic reducer autonomous car one tool goal along larger autonomous vehicle many people health issue make difficult impossible use traditional public transport autonomous service help people well others need ride unusual time remote destination demand low could even shadow bus may capacity
ah yes cuckmobile
maker sponsored video honest answer
everyone life dense city high average income decent concentration technical people well maintained road add mix government bureaucracy competing technology set technical expert best version self driving car everyone else something dangerous different political faction particular special interest year actually generous estimate long average person might waiting self driving car
train pls
think im worried state software verification
bro hope made good money minute add like real solution car accident increase public transportation full stop gross shilling awful solution bad look
really disappointed v commercial driverless car company ignoring every fact contradicts position thats expect science education channel id expect muskstan channel please remove stain channel embarrassing driverless car likely ever viable human driven car become illegal based slowly yes heard ml evolving going another year driverless car mix humandriven vehicle safely driverless car cause accident humandriven car nonhuman thus hard predict human intuition reaction quite time come human drive intuition thought intuition take long time train much longer ml cant introduce something violates intuitive knowledge without causing fail far frequently used tech messiah fictional original
interesting video unfortunately lot real problem technology scenario associated explored seems video autonomous car simply better human trust long way really happens im engineering student french engineering school right im working autonomous vehicle technology associated firstly united state country recent well maintained road easy take example fully autonomous car europe country older road complex mapping even nonexistent paved surface especially countryside easy interstate city road well maintained pretty simple master autonomous car map area commonly used take advantage well placed maintained element marker road case secondly software able programmed true almost time nothing particular happen playing statistic mean point system face something programmed handle problem case even able recognize something wrong thing actually try even worse lead catastrophic event way handle case simply letting driving operator take control solve issue even possible solve issue facing problem avoid accident crash example ive seen lot software simply give create worse situation didnt knew even worse analyze situation correctly real future scenario autonomous car shuttle public transportation able drive fully autonomously main axis city road well maintained mapping already done fully autonomous car able go anywhere without limit something count near future talking
youre going judge software handle rare unexpected situation need also judge human react situation whether selfdriving car perfect whether theyre better human think metric already clearly superior
davidguild main problem software deduction capability create solution already know situation something unexpected happened people consider consequence action others type problem rare ive found road work area without way knowing exactly go small road could autonomous car solve problem appart simply going around impossible even worse huge traffic spike people cop road worker regulating traffic hand movement dense intersection consider software crashing bug operation would security around system course software better u simple task facing infinite possibility unpredictable environment ensure security people inside outside car responsibility ok driver company responsible
solution unexpected situation ask passenger im sure autonomous vehicle av turn around reroute damaged falling cliff shut call help connect av central database accessible road stuff av find damaged blocked road update database reroute ask passenger wait av reroute ask come spot either road block remove cowsdelivery vehicleskids another av update database road maintenance remove problem fixing road updating database simple im sure software engineer thought already
polatiger assuming constant stable access database yes assuming server never break assuming car able recognize problem first place first spot assuming passenger help problem he blind mute mental problem asleep thats lot assumption lot example simple situation becoming unsolvable problem one part chain lot system arent redundant enough called secure
think indeed need either limit use av wellknown areasroads must ensure driver capable taking av deems situation unrecognizable cant use nearly blind agree lucas always risk car recognize situation never reliable estimation hazard
hey derek love whole video sound like ad
think main difference plane car complexity traffic air traffic isnt nearly dense unpredictable ground motor vehicle traffic plane also mostly fly streight line whereas car need make many turn watch bad marking bad driver sometimes road arent even painted
thing listed area human driver worse computer human go city traffic phone cause accident computer dont get distracted
canieaturcarrots much people like brag able multitask im fairly certain human arent multithreaded cant actually put focus multiple task everyone followed road law time would lot le accident say accident would gone im saying wed see reduction number accident
thx captain obvious
true computer sufficient training guaranteed much better job human computer see thing human cant wavelength invisible human le wont forget object identified wont get distracted hardwired stop car computer crash reboots whereas human fall asleep wheel almost always forgets step brake first
deusexaethera area human still better though like human experience needed soccerball roll onto street know soft child near need cautious
alright got thinking self driving car seem getting better still convinced solving pressing problem best scalable solution traffic problem accident
hope come london
lol waymo sponsoring video seeing tesla fly
question something video doesnt cover pedestrian cross road front car impunity knowledge theyll stop unlike irate human driver pedestrian take advantage uk law jaywalking thank goodness
since cant handle snow ice yet instead calling fully autonomous called fair weather autonomous
carina live cam agree truly ready go online honestly cant wait till sleep car long ride haveother activity tinted window let car driving
imagine berlin white line street worn
city invest good condition autonomous vehicle well germany doesnt even want invest gmmwave
even cause accident still implemented cause le accident sometimes argument although may prevent million death cause hundred death would otherwise happened people focus rather total reduction death
please get video lucid dreaming
people communicating work wouldnt nearly stressful
driver road probably freaking lol invisible driver still wear seatbelt driverless car
horrible idea
""
dont want machine control life
actually entirely possible people average driversbecause average defined mean median
long reliable dont rely internet database think good hope law made require driver seated manual override sensor break
great status update really good hear hioe let car learn good driver expect anticipate human driver stupid surprising thing especially already behave conspicious
way wish come true need drive work anymore manually driven car year taught u work remotely commuting work already sound like anachronism
video came day ago
convincing enough claim driverless car ultimately safer data back much correct however completely different thing claim road presence driver unless car driverless even single idiot wreck otherwise perfect traffic flow cause accident
hacking problem
car hacked cant
ton daylight driving rain fog lidar doesnt work radar tho flaw forbid drive human solution car comuncate others road act without uncertainty think moment still excited future thanks video
cyclist pedestrian people car usually want go place tend mix idea fenced road underpass pedestrian cross sound dystopian honestly
good point nothing chaotic human haha think low speed problem already safety outdoor lidar scanner short range mt need meter lay concern
peremoral fair enough definitely see closed highway motorway autonomous car hope doesnt lead continuation car centric design city especially downtown area residential zone autonomous car sharing would certainly help compared individual car traffic surely interesting see city change next decade two
ok drift donut drag race got ta ask real question
waymo missed big opportunity didnt call johnny cab
counterpoint shouldnt filthy commie respect personal right freedom
wtf
cant even tell youre trying argue
well think correct answer question make full stop let two driver avoid insult driving like guess full stop impossible
need buyback gas car give people free driverless car truly want dominate road
india still elevator dedicated people whose sole job press button
still elevator dedicates people press button america incredibly useful system
itll easy people get board autonomous car car autonomous technology obviously going way safer human driver
global warming relay priority washington car would everywhere
robot created amazing people always better human
one problem autonomous vehicle cant better human driver perfect least near perfect soon accident vehicle fault well blame who fault charge car company damage driver insurance car make choice avoiding person road expense safety person inside car make choice happens something isnt perfect road line arent marked well road graffiti stop sign prevents car recognizing someone autonomous vehicle properly maintained isnt working way
sure preventing fatality good thing
funny driver exist still need buckled seatbelt
stg extra people thinking theyre average live massachusetts
really hit home sister legally blind self driving car way travel
highest possible benchmark car wud drive successfully indian road
people think average driver think well distribution driver true imagine driver score test point driver score point sensible distribution longer tail bad driver side make true make argument people overestimating ability would also say many people actually average driver
case small sample like gave potential lot sampling bias data million make skewed distribution like statistically improbable
ive never understood nobody come conclusion extreme choice scenario like human driver car choose outcome weighted random chance there defensible course action choosing death injury outcome except random chance
wonder many milion death could avoided country would actually pay attention good driver education giving people licence car machine weighs ton drive easily kph around town yet people got used tha one pay attention fact theyre dangerous approached without caution knowledge im mad car kinda taken granted today society really take lot practice involvement desire learn least moderetaly good driving also driving lot answer keep something without knowledge good way may actually harmful
get siren make everyone pull side road
im little disappointed barely even mentioned limitation waymos phoenix operation best recall offhand comment road well maintained phoenix chosen reason excellent driving weather road arent complicated traffic isnt particularly heavy even advantage believe waymo relies exhaustive cmscale mapping entire service area eg car know road dont think approach particularly scalable yes exciting work give lot hope future think long way eventual goal driverless car safe use arbitrary road p ive seeing recommended video age much longer usual maybe youtube know video sister company
video week old
interesting point limitation technology fact video recommended feed watched dereks recent unsponsored video mean conspiraceh
think reason brought phoenix ideal city think bestonly way start seeing widespread adoption driverless car first start controlled situation slowly iterate le controlled one im referring rd process actual commercial deployment well imagine rather driverless car suddenly become legal everywhere well first see certain stretch highway autonomous certified highway limited access since certification process whitelist standard developed fhat must met highway certified autonomous driving experience human driver drive around like normal theyll pas sign landmark something let know engage full self driving mode time highway adapted meet standard standard also expand software get better eventually enough autonomous vehicle road could start autonomousonly stretch highway thered automatic gate something doesnt let unless youre autonomous vehicle finally enough contiguous road autonomous certified start thinking deploying truly driverless vehicle place think driverless autonomous vehicle make sense perhaps shorter term small area city speed low year ago might expected trolley line run
ive seen one car san francisco ocean weather including mist heavy wind starting roll elsewhere
cubicgc interesting good know thanks
million job might eliminate ever go mainstream becomes production friendly term money automation always disrupts even move forward
haha joke southeast asia free motorcycle contest
good cant kansei dorifto
nose tail accident id imagine although phoenix road good wonder drive gravel road australia outback
honestly cant wait main stream going love extra space garage walle world let go
wonder going take responsibility accident involving driverless car owner car cant held liable driverless car erroneously running school childrento put extreme big case involving service history mechanic forth come back manufacturer case wont ever see driverless car id assume manufacturer waive responsibility point someone going take blame
charge automatically manually
unless enjoy driving
every time click ill like nah boring nerdy clicking mind blown
car enthusiast dont
thanks want train public transportation actually
literally delamain cyberpunk
great video one thing wish included discussion whether selfdriving car even desirable solution first place especially hyperspeed train public transport system tend far far robust significantly lower carbon footprint
high speed train consumes lot energy take lot resource manufacture trainsets smash railway line town city park check current h controversy uk instance fleet self driving ev rent using largely preexisting infrastructure ability form nosetotail convoy motorway would likely much lower carbon impact versus building equipping operating high speed train line self driving car especially ev public transport system
derek seemed enthusiastic he like new technology nice also horrendous video
prefer driving cause love
im sure possible automated elevator slim possibility whole automated vehicle system hacked thats emergency stop button important
""
look great though wonder itll able handle smaller road uk negotiate pulling side road gap line parked car allow oncoming car pas common small city country road
cant wait day bug hack inserted controlling server literally everyone driving car moment dy sure much safer
little brother make wonder driving going useless skill grow
faith selfdriving car p
next trend idiot trying get run self driving car lol
trust car see driving safely european city street middle age rush hour traffic
purely sponsored video waymo lol sorry never tesla yet
think thing holding back question responsibility held responsible accident driver option step company wrote flawed code governent allowed usage car im philosopher mean maybe already smart answer issue
data seems favor driverless car well day able make video hundred mile journey family trip child back seat seat one driver seat end journey repeat night day talk put driverless car street right
day ago driving national road nd biggest type road poland road work line ground made absolutely sense km weaving around road yellow white line dont see autonomous vehicle would able drive
problem selfdriving car path de way forbiding driving
phoenix profile wanted point choose one way another driveless car ever happen would big step forward good driver may allways allowed drive
dont doubt driverless car would lead fewer death statistically main concern distribution death since car share algorithm depending technology there chance accident would concentrated place people dont look like training data applies mostly computervisionbased technology even lidar there chance someone wearing clothes absorb light detected sensor
feel like exploited easily emergency vehicle use encoded signal automated car understand else hacker interfere thing
hacker interfering playing siren dont understand playing sound make hacker
joedavola automated car react siren automatically drive side could people choose exploit feature using siren know car react
yeah sesor damaged defected warn n would allow continue drive slow speed also broadcast vehicle problem nearby vehicle stay alert much possibility
missed option poll vote le car sustainable infrastructure like public transit cycling
yes absolutely needed get car road
glorifying car instead developing public transport american worldview
kind research need move away individual car towards autonomous public transport
shuttle car autonomous public transport
excellent video knew coming along well ive heard waymo since live near chandler didnt know good already thanks derek
random promotion nothing new
looking forward car service shuttle pick call rent day time drive never vehicle subscribe one
pedestrian accident seem hit rear portion side car could vehicle noticed coming close stopped quickly pedestrian biker skateboarder expected keep going able pas right behind
mention northern uscanada winter driving capability radar automatic cruise control honda regularly commission due snow buildup certain condition follow relating fully autonomous vehicle winter driving condition would appreciated
question instead traffic light police officer manually guiding traffic let say traffic lightpower grid go intersection way stop arent stop sign posted would system detect pattern car would freeze moving object around also car make turn situation would wait oncoming car make turn would proceed ahead freeze car go straight like normal way car detect pothole avoid im siked self driving car like situation ive ran past month sparked question
interesting would use car crash video content mean machine learning context

thing im thinking every car going electric day wont electronics automated car drain battery much energy electric automated car use elecric car driver
fully autonomous need internet connection operate period automate process living every case make operator dumber well sensor communication network car rely hold time use expands city dweller who commute taken automation going scariest thing youve ever seen loses internet connection one sensor go flaky
important subject wouldve liked see discussing would handle cyber attack
personally curious would handle brake working like would act nothing wrong would actually work find safest place crash something like

welll speaks driverless car thrill joy riding car
car drive place like mumbai hat believe gon na question car
say seen driverless car thailand maybe bit easier
funniest part apprehension toward autonomous driving great majority scenario people afraid car behave would longer ever happen car autonomous exaggerate bit doesnt matter car would deal accident accident obviously accident would disappear like would car deal someone suddenly swerving front well car also autonomous would never suddenly swerve
every autopilot accident reported every news outlet across country thats case human driver certain existential angst driving mistrust ai fear potentially unavoidable obsolescence biology struggle notion might lose selfappointed position top intelligence hierarchy etc realize however intelligence universe artificial emanates universe courage abandon notion traditional substrate biology planet special privilege notion life understand beautiful reality life bringing forth new life birth might feasible way spreading earth biology throughout galaxy creating opportunity splendor experience happen elsewhere seems among noblest pursuit killing pound metal box wheel also pretty cool

there major ethical dilemma dilemma showed even bigger one dilemma responsibility imagine cause accident way hold morally responsible algorithm piece software intangible thing maker surely cant held responsible since scenario one thought billion mile training arise maker fault making fully autonomous creating essentially zero responsibility scenario even though autonomous car come ever mistake letting driver thing sleep driving need pay attention someone held responsible

thanks putting together derek brought really interesting point hope people inherently untrusting dont latch onto van stopped abruptly pedestrian moment argument side
im automated driverless car running traffic light speeding turning front someone drifting bike lane etc
people drive living jobless
let agree disagree human need another excuse lazy people like really like driving computer degrade using one day mousepad decided stop working want far away brake pedal turn car suddenly unable turn right whatever reason whats point aiming high end machine ferrari lamborghini nissan gtr etc going drive point let people want use use dont impose standard
encouraging video u novice inventor
try making self driving car indiapakistan see happens solution st world country right
dont trust technology guess flew airplane last year plane flew
okay ultimate cost saver would autonomous bus taxi public transportation
think invisible light car use detect sueroundings could eventually cause damage enough road one time one car may harmless maybe bombarded invisible laser beam sun already sends youre walking street isnt healthy
truly excited fully automated car though worried people skin eye becomes big enough thing
got question car autonomous parking lot car gon na public like taxi might cause issue car personal would able park somewhere right people want personal car parking lot cant eliminated
first time dislike video derek uber driver
live drive side derek passenger seat looked like driver seat confused since didnt realise wasthe driver
please make video panorama doesnt work escalator
counterpoint million lose job even worrying handful company control transportation sector people rely increase price people option pay
job argument never stopped progress example video elevator operator show
lol acyea cant tell sweat dripping youlmao
waymo isnt scalable tesla need map area completely driving work inside city tesla trying make general autonomous vehicle would work anywhere using camera lidar like waymo like human would
biggest fear self driving car even like emergency braking weather isnt good like human see feel feedback brake hit ice tackling issue like tesla autopilot doesnt work well snow sensor stuff know figure guess surrounding camera sensor heating element
driverless car solve traffic problem make worse also person silly enough let car drive public road need head read sorry car lethal missile capable killing driver pedestrian trust computer drive car responsible action insane even legally somehow responsible robot car killing someone psychologist bill subsequent depression guilt worth driving joy process engage road condition process leverage decade driving experience requires keen observation skill accurate risk assessment early threat identification order complete trip safely never allow car drive anywhere however allow car monitor driving take action save suffer medical emergency sort driving save falling asleep crashing badly technology functional isnt people die leaving life life others hand driverless car absolutely crazy
screw ban ai development replaces u car enthusiast human think nothing worse
pothole snowy road im sure case gravel road would useful cant take
thanks sharing u
personally cant wait opportunity ride autonomous vehicle really believe way prevent many accident world im sure first ride scared like crazy isnt many new thing many people scared first time flying though considered safe regular task believe later era autonomous vehicle need communicate perfection tech might get level many traffic jam eliminated cause software know best route take talking others maybe eliminate traffic light thing get well enough kid running ball road might issue anymore im exaggerating still hope see autonomous vehicle nearby road asap
ad waymo veritasium video
rain reflection snow hiding lane sensor unmaintained road lane etc there many variable trust tech today
curious round rushhour stuck traffic jam would car able notice one human steered car round signal via waving flashing drive incident video car suddenly breaking prediction car behind expecting pedestrian stay sidewalk didnt slow crash driving along small dirt road another car approaching system know far safely drive road let car pas general recognise layout road distinctive marking mean car would self driving case wouldnt problem solution transition
never gon na happen love technology self deiven vehicle nope
unfortunately seems waymo approach autonomy scalable solution globally short medium term system requires high definition map need constantly maintained tech car still cost figure whilst economy scale eventually bring still take many many year break even wonderful technology though need government subsidise accelerate widespread adoption economic benefit couldnt clearer im personally betting tesla solve autonomy l time get better better underestimate power neural net machine learning youre doubt watch alphago netflix youtube moving vision radar clear indication theyre confident right strategy globally instantly scalable solution version tesla vision drop tonight interesting see much better im surprised tesla didnt get mention chance video tesla approach feel compare think balanced view would appreciated subscriber
ok sick want one
problem autonomous car likely crash infrequently ranty control freak society want ban human driving note one bogus argument occasionally presented refers supposed terrible dilemma algorithm choose like put killing baby killing nun idea seems assume unseen programmer play god creating pecking order sort human choose run car computer choose nun baby cant leaving algo aside utterly unrealistic scenario reality algorithm already making decision head idiot human got car situation first place aside sure hope real autonomous car look bit sexy
nobody seems think butt firmware update software update security vulnerability issue code working server software tell matter good process company etc someday somehow bug left sometimes cause big issue nobody care
come let disruption driving begin cant wait see driverless car everywhere safer traffic
seems technology still year away maybe could see smaller size commercial car
sound nice consider economic factor heard driver represent one largest pool employment wont good people job
cant wait become norm honestly people feal really save comfortable think system need level worked without major accident several year large scale
hate idea fully autonomous vehicle also thing
never use driverless car dont need make moral decision
people enjoy driving dont feel comfortable letting ai never wide spread thing except exclusive place
think world market maybe five computer thomas watson president ibm reasonable prediction probably placing much confidence people enjoy good something remove driving theyll enjoy something else doesnt put someone el life danger part drive scenery conversation fellow passenger etc enjoyed even driverless car yes think might become form amusement go manual driving station drive car hour feel power machine feeling yes people always want least generation
people used say thing past like elevator
kamilciesla wow really dumb response thanks making feel good intelligence

yes probably car accident
dose chip shortage production car need computer chip
maybe u long wide road try europe narrow various type road maybe anywhere else world u road standart road like exception road system like north america anywhere else world
jealous
people function road ai better
going hv driverless car
yes feeling autopilot decade self driving car

luckyizzac police talk
anjon person carduh also ai wont passing speed limit avoiding traffic light police wont pull unless sort criminal
luckyizzac lol police pull even dont cross speed limit besides youre thinking always passenger car
anjon cop tell pull car doesnt take manual control stop whats complicated
think human know drive properly better way thinking facing situation like letting person cross street giving chance car get road parking gentle general
would guess self driving car would better human case designed way safe real problem would direction lack aggression andor rule breaking needed car sit forever red light malfunction never change happens twice per year car go mph speed limit merge necessary get stuck side freeway
know making video quite nowbut seriouslyyou producing best interesting content youtube really appreciate hard work go making video
within year think autonomous vehicle may majority road road made smaller changed pedestrian cyclist infrastructure traffic may nearly eliminated human error related crash near multiple household may share one car car sharing service may dominate people may even need car anymore one car need sit parking lot hour day may drive go give people ride
note possible driver think average actually take simple example people score score test people scored average think
convenience sell repetitive aspect job automated present person free time city planning concept dedicated bus lane major route drive workspace shopping mall airport come segment dedicated lane help initial fear greeted driver
dont want space dedicated car want ride vehicle dont drive take subway bus kind public transportation fck car whether driverless
blank let wait watch
self driving car good getting self driving bus high capacity public transport always prioritized individual car
agreed
work people crammed small space know single person living city carbon footprint bigger people family car dog living countryside would negate worsen tried make better world city emit carbon emission world population
olympics
gon na get get driverless car theyre technology
cant get autonomous bus without getting autonomous car first bus bigger car
really safety improving world release source code audit maybe even help improve money usual
spoke dad driving turn neck check blind spot almost pull stop sign swerve lane play radio phone still though good driver crash year
goood driver shut hell show old man respect nothing wrong swerving change radio one around dork
ikeepgettinbanned confused second realized troll ill never understand fun convincing people youre even dumber already
think driverless car needed least developing country many people work private car driver earn livelihood
many lost life could avoided driverless car dont think many people work private driver
could report like even mention tesla autonomous driving mode right need turn
airplane expect human take control unexpected situation much program system honestly exactly manual quick reference sheet pilot programable response
waymo come nyc ultimate test wait read mind announced theyll come nyc
notice car california im waiting see test drive minnesota blizzard
think would pay subscription service set time want go wherever car show exact time would never deal sleezeball dealership maintenence road rage etc sound crazy gon na happen
consider land use implication technology like commuting easy everyone take selfdriving car well need road dont care organized av make limit throughput single occupancy vehicle road le place want live society road society place
maximum efficiency per person self driving car never high maximum efficiency self driving bus
maximum efficiency different measure im bus turn neighborhood pick someone else thats efficient isnt eitheror self driving bus self driving single passenger vehicle valuable place future
mason yea agree vehicle solve two different problem one latency problem long wait arrive destination throughput problem many people deliver point point b reasonable amount time
maximum efficiency per person self driving car never high maximum efficiency train already build walking cycling network getting beyond train station remove car road entirely theyre inefficient dangerous horrible environment
car driverless paying access fleet selfdriving car make much sense
minor note green space comment perhaps check channel bike discus difference urban design uscanada netherlands video living netherlands seems clear u could already wished refuse myriad let say good reason throwing green space comment seemed like american relying crutch isnt needed
whelp time buy impreza b lotus europa caterham super sport thank later
good see noted utter insanity expecting safety backup driver suddenly take despite passenger practice
hey derek awesome video however youre probably unintentionally advancing idea future transportation carbased driverless car whereas majority research put train form mass public transportation safest efficient cheaper option compelling future one car probably ai driver reduced le frequent option city designed around people road idea course mean le profit company one sponsoring video im implying illintent behalf beware conflict interest
fully autonomous vehicle basically already exist far passenger concerned called bus train replacing individual car road b many point failure technological attack vector malicious actor also completely stupid camera mean sensor break time network connection mean possibility taken control cant hack human brain yet could hack every car turn camera crash
elevator driver failed analogy driverless car elevator still driver people actually using driverless car dont doubt advantage driverless car still say thanks one piece dystopian hellhole looming machine everywhere street sky le freedom autonomy youll nothing happy select company bigger government taking care u become dependent autonomous car expensive average person funny see people removed driver stuck desk call center making money elite waymo thanks ill pas
yet watching liking commenting automated bigcompany platform making money elite waymo youre loving hellhole really
think ive seen much bad code way simpler project automated vehicle hard imagine engineer opportunity resolve defect issue fully since inevitably project manager stakeholder nontech oriented folk dont really seem care tech debt incrementally better design principle said cool want believe work want believe vehicle well thought well tested way handle fault think car probably better able handle common situation ive accident waved lefthand turn driver drove around stopped car front tboned ended considered fault youre really supposed make turn someone wave greater increase automated car usage pretty much completely resolve silly stuff like aside kinda dislike jerky driving seems smoothly car able drive optimal condition notice someone wavering around crosswalk like situation happened tend slow enough dont make sudden turn odd vehicle would make jerky stop course lot people including may see detail like especially driving around busy area case kinda wish car could start giving driver info whats going around car standard feature camera feel featureless
trust autonomous vehicle drive better human dont trust human behind security infrastructure driverless fleet waymo support center seems like prime target future terrorism prevent attack fleet ensuring passenger dont become hostage rogue element seem awfully well connected push button call service remotely interact vehicle seen target last question rhetorical onstar similar
dont want drive anymore
ok im atlanta speed limit freeway everybody go program car break law otherwise wont able merge
sample car around figure fast go
switch sign
vintagerock human drive mph
nates youve ignored question though car figure fast need go car around speed limit wont unless programming allows exceed posted limit end stalling onramp causing backup
christopherbedford enforce speed limit update would problem autonomous car theyre going correct speed there problem like thats want would expect car however law add leniency autonomous car allows go speed limit like everyone else would also solution like there many way tackle problem autonomous car autonomous
go job expect turmoil
disappointing video question need know camera computer function better human obviously happens multiple company competing business operate vehicle road happens system crash essential hotfix required rush hour system made hackproof realistic believe people move driverless vehicle individual driver continually spoil beautiful ballet derek usually asks much pertinent question turn receive much insight subject hand maybe introduction taking care basic misgiving important step would hope isnt true never spoken u hopefully made strictly advertisement case say make money derek deserve es
average mean everyone think c remember couple student getting c le thats grading system work right
get duo autonomous vehicle
imagine riding autonomous vehicle worst storm ever need windshield wiper
yeah thats year experience arizona lol put car india youd screwed use autonomous car cant even identify whats road whats
chance way never
use road line indicator stay lane true problem country half year snow may covering road even doesnt use line indicator always uneasy feeling car like patch ice would car know react hitting patch black ice hydroplaning heavy short rain thing kind think would feel good getting car location least could see alright area weather consistent
psychopath walking toward hammer knife
man straightup walked side waymo
probably looking phone dont
million people going loose job think important implication mention derek
life job future old man
let preface driverless car system like waymo data collected perfect driving condition like middle arizona dry road clear condition wide street etc rain deep wet snow sleet poor visibility glaze black ice etc perhaps need dig data would liked see derek dive issue least address hey waymo come test seward alaska
suggestion put anamotronic dummy driver seat doesnt drive think big strange part there nobody people outside car cut flip dummy driving slow
could conversational dummy go sport politics make racist comment haha
usvalve wonder technology
thank making
one main thing driverless car end need massive number job form courier would longer needed isnt bad thing society adapts meet change provide new avenue travel never happen people dont care one another degree fine leaving unemployed driver displaced
oh god give u functioning public transport already stop wasting life money elon musk crap
wtf monkas
pessimist complains traffic optimist hope clear realist make entire fleet fully autonomous car driver
realist invests strong public transportation system decrease amount traffic via downsthomson paradox reduces size road decrease amount traffic via dissuaded demand instead investing expensive stopgap measure ability prove actually help anything
yeah keep people sex back
sooner better
twelve year old might even need driver license
although future driverless car shouldnt give skill like driving stick rare nowadays far way cooler know
jablanguado besides go long way keep friend borrowing car borrow car sure drive stick uh ill see find someone else fact gotten bad manual transmission actually antitheft device
sighthoundman funnily enough dad taught drive told im teaching none friend drive car year learned drive friend mine got car locked door watched outside looked around second cluelessly rolled window looked said cant drive started laughing wanted take around block mess couldnt take parking spot lol good laugh
driver could better average eg driver terrible drag average enough better median
hey really something eyerings like sleep dont overwork
great video one welcome new car overlord lol question though first happens road rage situation emergency life could danger someone trynna run road blocking trying attack persontoperson second happens someone decides jerk wheel current weymo
feel point protocall question please get human road human going one point another human biggest headache
camera microphone lidar vital operation lot system potentially break simple car reliable
like driverless technology like channel dont like watching ad though
literally take le time install ad blocker take write comment whinging ad
zeanomourphmeaning whole video ad
josephc haha fair enough one flew right head
soon insurance company determine liability risk cheaper automatic car get one insurance company know real data risk
video like horror movie taxi driver trucking could automated think trucking company would still want human vehicle make harder potential thief stop truck rob takeaway technology autonomous vehicle much closer many people believe essentially already government requirement testing thats keeping driverless car mass produced least sunny part united state northern region country snow ice introduce whole range new problem wonder well company like waymo prepared deal
let say criminal one car police find wan na stop car respond going pull hears siren police turn continiues driving nothing happened
cant wait robot murder
lmao comparing autopilot plane car literally ridicule thing ever
like scale task creating something work limited scope compared working traffic street many edgecases stupid like flying glide slope easily captured formula selfdriving car controlled math something even people created cant understand sorry video f ad
wan na see cyber security possibility vehicle hacked malicious third party dangerous address
people think hacking like hollywood movie
ive waiting self driving since started driving awesome
concern would adverse weather affecting add system add potential fault system going handle maintenance cost making sure something fail say lane highway mph
critique self driving car right understanding need programmed know road make essentially train track guess im wondering sustainable technique road work weather cause track become unreliable working way around
basic freedom freedom movement taken away
know whats even safer cheaper nicer commute driverless car good public transportation increasing saftey thouroughput like adding lane highway doesnt make traffic better often make worse make city much spread cant walk anymore increasing traffic statistic complete b google cant dismiss trolly problem rare going happen need thought beforehand dont want live future one fault accident company incentive make tech safe usually make good video disappointed paid remake year old video
putting technology electric car
ideal condition look feasible poorly marked road bad weather eg snow accident avoidance random road rage etc kiss reliability trust goodbye
could build high speed rail infrastructure
ready driverless car hated driving moment allowed
somehow missed scalable solution based hd map geofenced premapped area expensive like hell estimated k
rutger ockhorst could also use solution transportation already proven instead relying boring company pseudoinnovation
think like ten fifteen year completely implemented could really cool since could way le car parked curb turn space bike lane city car wasting space day used used borrowed car wouldnt need many car standby time understandably thats gon na take long time people abandon private car
device software failure know software crash sensor device fail
deficient sensor defect sensor camera weird ghost idk car still safe car become frequent big corporate company buy car sure car well maintained capitalist system encourages cutting cost would argue beginning youd reckless time say manager wont say one broken camera versus functioning one car programmed strike error keep going still contingency used put profit safety dont know still see potential human error screw thing yeah statistically unlikely year say year say car maintained well enough imagine maintenace would quite costly
drive road hasnt previously mapped
concerned nominal driving condition handled well autonomous system concern nominal condition created car road driven human
oh changed title thumbnail got attention
better machine
lived phoenix metro area life would much rather see shift public infrastructure particularly transportation megalopolis perfect example develop id love science could focus far practical solution broadly realizable near future
solution ppl dont want follow
using airplane example cherry picking time human taking lead crash ignoring much prominent boing automated system causing far crash shorter span time guess someone please sponsor present fact science channel
theory behind tech solid dont think fully actualized theory yet bug work driverless vehicle future vehicle travel
hi avionics engineer yes true boeing max crash due automated mcas indeed failure automation however saying cat iii autoland cherry picked example simply case autoland system performed million landing autonomously decade far basic statistic go kind system represent norm industry yes derek couldve included boeing mcas failure however mcas autoland system compared driverless system mcas simply meant make max feel way ng course failed category automatic control system meant augment pilot input furthermore even boeings mcas category autoland ironically would one cherry picked example going back basic statistic boeing mcas crash represent miniscule proportion air accident personally think derek shouldve brought incident failure automated system couldve opportunity contrast immense number deadly incident caused arrogant moron think better everybody hope help
fearbased problem riding autonomous vehicle said good driver decade actual racetrack experience addition held driver license since havent moving violation since christmas eve got speeding ticket going mph mph zoneon straight downhill section highway one exception never involved accident another vehicle driver exception fault rear ended traffic light teenaged cardriver sitting motorcycle waiting light change dont necessarily claim better driver computer would say thing point good driver record prof im really unsafe driver compared ideal computer beyond really enjoy driving like wheel enjoy far like along ride private pilot would rather fly plane sit point point b like process occupies mind dont want deprived mind id ok owning level autonomous vehicle long also one feature ability turn system drive car whenever want
awesome cant wait technology thanks positivty
literally watched daily dose internet video tesla thought moon yellow light im writing make fun mention ton practicality problem self driving car worldwide
love daily dose
imagine choosing daily dose veritasium form judgement
flaya using either looking many source formulating opinion like something doesnt mean dictate opinion objective read measurable fact
flaya thing provided example go wrong autopilot car based dd video funny example context veritasium video people good thing think machine software better human never mistaken moon yellow light ton real issue need resolved actually use self driving car worldwide
chaseferdinand dig wasnt accusing anything like amplifying good
think would safer future driving fun give also liberty please rather getting point point b
think current computer could done sully human incredible new situation also make lot mistake im autonomous vehicle think make road much safer coordination vehicle also make traffic jam thing past
passenger car could smaller use le fuel road could take le pavement require le maintenance shipper wouldnt worry driver getting tired head senior year reliable transportation could mean could age place longer however could someone usurp one kidnap someone steal content shipped could driverless always available
open source totally
oh god wendover really sound like back
imagine three people different driving skill level call people b c skill level b skill level c skill level average skill meaning people average think theyre average perfectly possible people said better thatd different
car stop person run car like simulation
underrated comment
x file music play background
usually love video felt like commercial waymo veneer science youtube top sad sponsorship like cant trust youre saying obviously biased
saw somebody driverless car road would roll window stick middle finger window
happens list lidar thousand car sending laser
need come soon safer also could reduce pollution caused traffic computer able drive almost perfect efficiency safe lot fuel
top issue video getting way solving problem year doesnt mean solution two year away something thats addressed even selfdriving car already perfect today model car still ten year away lot people
cant wait till get rid human driver concern know car break machine break time something go wrong inside car spending freeway
delaware real life
asiana flight actually excellent example automation overdependence instrument landing system il inoperative day autoland available pilot also overdependent il guidance basically forgot land using visual cue also current autopilot technology overridden pilot uncounted number time new aircraft may able perform pilotless flight existing aircraft good example people still required loop
test car real world traffic ideal condition bring one bucharest manages incident week mean software ready
whats use case tho want driven somewhere uber way cheaper techpacked fully autonomous car want selfdriving car comma cheap still drive manually want
driving test selfdriving car
car need perfect better human
much
didnt veritasium another video self driving car
cant wait trade vehicle subscription car service come pick whenever want wherever want need go lowes pick something sends pick truck im another city transportation easy using app phone cant wait
dont remove driver seat steering weel etc im sure freak people seeing wheel turn steering wheel would feel like elevator
probably would happen eventually
someone could take emergency control
chewycornell back seat
showed little toy car beginning build specially one theyre using modified normal car
bearcubdaycare guess youre right maybe bought normal car added self driving stuff didnt bother take wheel
feel like people get worse direction might become completely helpless come getting point point b time maybe bike become thing road become safer bike dont know interesting
one thing video disappointingly ignores security risk vehicle pose remotely operated recipe disaster ai driving individual car never never answer imagine money poured project went public infrastructure transit disappointed none actual argument even mentioned
city already dont need massive parking lot already good public transport future unless assuming everyone poor autonomous vehicle adequate public transportation provided still parking lot private autonomous car
mode transport viable travelling longer distance thru area risky car jacking armed robbery since autonomous driving vehicle designed stop pedestrian
somehow feel like trying carjack autonomous vehicle isnt going go far carjackers favour carjacker jack car carjacker ok go car nah dont think lock door call police
going like hand holding camera see nothing camera driver seat
wonder driver seat
hmmmm think hear thought pilot airplane
never use elevator climbing stair healthier always choose bicycle selfdriving car
yeah like disabled people would find climbing flight stair healthy
kurozawa course likely find elevator le occupied people able take stair actually like street le crowded people take bike may ask disabled sorry felt offended comment much reply help deciding whether take stair elevator next climb
doesnt mention car driverless one equipped facial recognition system social credit score ranking determine someone travel car defy master wont able even use vehicle everywhere go every word say recorded combine upcoming global central bank digital currency cbdc cant spend single dime money without big brother approving authorizing one imagine horrifying scenario plan enslavement humankind
ayo derek ayo flip seatbelt
wondering every car lidar wouldnt interfere sensor vehicle around
might communicate figure difference
thats amazingly interesting question
yes
huh
low dutycycle short pulse transmitted comparatively long interval random pulsesequences make possible correlate returned signal signal scattered vehicle contributing small degree discriminated away guess type problem often handled radar
human cant beat accuracy computer
perform poor weather condition understand start make sense place almost perpetual sunshine reason voted year people dont live place like
car autonomous there human risk aside pedestrian much problem would hacking
iirc asiana could landed auto il iac pilot must able land aircraft period cat iii possible divert another airport
dont confuse u fact mind made
yeah would love south africa make hijacking waymo easier people stand road car stop hijacker jump bush
human run people standing road
largenaq stop get hijacked
largenaq autonomous car wont know get tough spot quickly
ee phd im looking forward someone love driving probably keep driving every car selfdriving im afraid getting bullied car road know mean lol anyway elevator part proper comparison like
id expect opposite knew car would stop thered consequence cutting
chainringcalf guess early time case amount got recorded company definitely record everything would expect update algorithm bring case court try best make customer happy instead u outlier still damaging environment lol
whole video sponsored
would car confuse lidar signal autonomous car
india still elevator driver call liftman
india would last autonomous car decade
driving phoenix different driving many location need see car safely navigate curvy poorly paved variable width poorly painted back road
learn dune
main issue driverless car nothing safety everything environmental impact like much would driverless car contribute lengthening commute time due convenience long insist taking half ton metal plastic u everywhere go energy requirement going unsustainable
imagine car bus vehicle got automatic would accident definitely
always pause right end headphone ending like ear rape
couldyou knowhave train
im pro ai dont think point yet say autonomous car would reduce number accident death ofc normal situation ai would win average ton issue road situation arnt considered software lead fatal mistake im saying need test make driver ai ready real world tho im looking forward witness ai overtake road
long said driver treat driving like pilot treat flying reason many driver abysmal bad driving go unpunished year time thus assume driving correctly fallacy also often lead severe accident occur ever notice party accident naturally deny fault reality often either person could prevented accident people need assume bad assume worst could always happen drive overabundance caution autonomous car inevitably kill someone arguably fault get sued type lawsuit overwhelm manufacturer remove incentive producing autonomous vehicle also autonomous vehicle replace personal vehicle u car represents freedom want want strongly suspect vehicle packed fully autonomous technology far expensive individual
car probably wont survive india
weve failed make selfcheckout without error feel looong way many variable pedestrian snow animal etc mean would bunch leaf blowing across road autumn cause car skid halt
thing make accept driverless car equal funding towards mass public transit also hate commercial man unsubscribing
question technical failure let say grid go day end
wouldnt also affect human driver thats argument selfdriving car
love driving one joy life id give name progress
like tech look like going big question northern climate handle icy road
happy self driving car think gon na save lot people livesnerves people bad driversdont like drive happy see making forced mandatory cant imagine car like love driving life thing enjoy life hope co habitation possible
im super looking forward driverless car need able take control certain situation like road heavy equipment maneuver deep snow
google smart via youtube think waymo chance tesla though good luck geofencing entire world
think point lot people miss car hit discussion would need program use resource detection lot thing would need incorporate agedetectionprogram helmetdetection genderisthewomanpregnantdetection etc etc wanted actually make ethical choice one actually want decide thing would use lot resource thing fact unlikely ever used
hell expensive advertisement waymo single bad thing said waymos autonomous driving solution perfect
work unrealistic safe city nice flowing traffic test brazil capital city choice
getting sponsored company making product youre video completely destroys scientific credibility channel ever wouldnt trust paper video lung cancer funded tobacco industry noone trust word say driverless car word bought paid tech could amazing world trust vital science science communication blew
nice ad really missed critical question
come youre going talk autonomous car talk tesla know sponsored way youll need new video explaining tesla actually much ahead
autonomous vehicle everywhere perception liability accidental deathdisability involving autonomous vehicle error fall human instead software impacted human find lowest resistance compensation without requiring legal help
driverless car go freedom
city built grid addict e europe simply true doesnt work
question least one person earth way better self driving car condition would believe better depend tech people say
loved video thakt insight self driving vehicle really hyped future hope eu also start allow self driving car classic quality veritasium video
good luck roundabout crappy road
combined bicycle getting around local community hailable driverless car could well convince get rid personal car particularly autonomous car make safer bicycle
future
lmao loser driving fun instead paying attention minding road people would rather bend computer age make sick
ikeepgettinbanned cant tell troll based name though
ikeepgettinbanned okay boomer
ikeepgettinbanned yeah cause computer almost everything better go join amish something
happens blackout communication area threat wildfirebushfire cutting major power supply communication equipment plus way emergency vehicle need ass viable option passenger threatened community
driverless car make taxi driver unemployed
going happen time soon
would awesome car would icecream sirene
think road trip across u youd stop use bathroom gas could make almost like flight sit get nc ca like day half rather day
lol
ship vehicle ship autonomous norway small period accident screened
think people fully commonly accept idea autonomous car great step accommodating machine ai daily life technology need greater level thought better future
would car insurance become irrelevant
im curious know cope varying rule road like youre driving round u therefore car following u rule uk drive opposite side road different speed limit road type rule way junction quite bit different roundabout likewise car cross border example drive home scotland south england board eurotunnel france
honestly cant wait driverless car become standard ive put learning drive year im terrified hurting someone causing expensive damage
yes definitely understand havent driven year anxiety
ok handle white snow condition unplowed road quite common area
long sensor stay clean probably better average driver sometimes minute le front radar covered road grime dont high hope
great video super intersting usual learning many thing channel thank
think people afraid driverless car afraid one car driver road human cant drive properly period
technology nearly respondent saying isnt scalable yet way affect life decade
fine better driver dont understand public transport wouldnt easiest safest option everyone well far way cheaper end
im one people beleive still far away standard dont trust technology dont trust people creating tech tested absolutlely everything make safe possible
okay make noise airplane taking moving
million mile quote isnt wholly correct brand new driver benefit knowledge many million mile driving form basis road safety legislation test requirement training go order become licenced driver suggest someone must drive x mile benefit experience gained x mile driving false case point adjusting speed appropriately corner dont need accident corner know may need adjust speed approaching one havent experienced crash corner know shared experience one many car driver speed contributory factor crash corner adjust
conflicted autonomous vehicle enjoy driving enjoy riding motorbike love idea able enable autodrive get home going night long journey equally recognise change liability insurance premium etc im concerned something currently enjoy dont expect human better enjoy thing sometimes
example seem infrastructure modified allow automation road selfdriving would done already
trucker goona finding new line work learn adapt please
know something thats probably made ride safer people around probably saw driverless car stayed away
cant come soon enough endless conservative resistance many year cuz muh freedom get point political party causing every single crash outlawed easily
wait
cant help think snipe stallone demolition man
driverless car year handful prototype work clear road good weather honestly useless city actual winter month year lane marker cant seen road take couple day cleared thing cant function without lane marker without obvious marker edge road even going commercially viable reliable
also issue autonomous vehicle hit issue cant navigate theyll fail spectacularly human may fail simple thing human navigate complicated novel situation like construction detour onto dirt path marked nothing cone road entire street filled snow safe path single lane cleared someone jeep honestly think realise dont think well ever robust driverless transport system without complete restructuring current road infrastructure otherwise dont see ai going navigate edge case everywhere thing start hit road place nevada place summerspring year round
also really dislike comparison automated landing plane automated system better human task mean better task second note automated landing plane requires whole host ground based equipment tell plane exactly far ground driverless car arent going kind instrumentation current implantation use camera vehicle based sensing like lidar maybe gps gps still isnt reliable enough staying road let alone specific lane meaning road obscured way system cant recognise roadlanes going come complete stop obstruct traffic cause accident
money sale would buy spot
future cant claim insurance accident due taking manual control car ie owner fault parent okay take car dare turn manual control
comment made realize insurance price probably go way well
monkiram lol yes le nromal insurance slowly climb year
uberalphasirus doesnt make sense
owner car could override via app maybe
monkiram wont capitalism pull make sure stay high fr probably would drop bc would demand thats drive market artificially inflate price car insurance industry doesnt die
well understood year ago atomic clock became reality two important factor mentioned clock precision strong wifi g since seems natural autonomous car start becoming normal thing
realized coloured le people would watched
seems really nice wonder much energy consume radar laser consume lot
feel like wouldnt necessarily computer lot energy consumption reasonable
probably drive much efficiently human driver saving energy example optimize acceleration rate speeding upslowing well turning future whole system vehicle level automation wont need traffic light wont waste energy stoppingslowing except obstruction road
ashmystic thats great point
ashmystic please let hellscape scenario never come pas traffic light closest thing safe pedestrian crossing area vast majority america
im positive grandchild ever get shocked tell drove car
factor distribution people could better mean average tbf
im driverless car theyre objectively better regular car point would even better country like usa stepped away carcentric urban planning though take amsterdam netherlands example decent sized city yet many people dont need even want car focussing proper public transport bicycle pedestrian infrastructure alternative simply practical often faster mean people really need car get wherever theyre going faster everyone else also driving car without asphalt ridiculous zoning requirement city much compact meaning distance get smaller car loud also autonomous one yes also electric car kmh tire noise becomes significant noise pollution harmful human cause lot stress make u sleep worse cause hearing loss name thing really aim provide alternative
jesus christ wendover production video much worse sound dead video
im selfdriving car general certainly drive better almost case one case need get away place soon possible selfdriving car designed stop isnt always good idea say shooter run behind gun plane land road edge case worry sure may handful death million saved doubt saving million life good shouldnt expense handful death human give away possibility agency question go way beyond selfdriving car value life counting number value every individual life value one life lost much million lost
isnt taxi human driver thing except expensive company run taking driver make profit offer customer real benefit love idea autonomous vehicle isnt much benefit public transport hop train dont worry anything hop waymo worry car doesnt scale compared planned public transport system think still lot hype around subject
vehicle waymo experience human driver see
delaying getting license year hope mean never get one
ad waymo lol who going clean car theyre shared vehicle like uber say last passenger threw trash therespilled drink threw passenger supposed clean vehicle pick self cleaning sorry waymo dont think driving dumpster wheel good idea
hey thats crazy du everything tram train something crazy far technology come
every machine taking man job le space human soul
thats little dramatic people probably thought world ending alchemist stopped thing didnt people got new job itll suck driver well le people becoming driver newer generation everything fine
monkiram ariman king
carso loud humming noise like ac
comparison elevator management logical first glance nonsense questioned closely elevator guide longer available elevator operated normal people control elevator hand steering wheel omitted others control car longer
make good video
yeah still would need alot work know people excited real arent necessary one like someone mentioned already comment human directing traffic ambulancespolice go got ta pull like way little cuz driver shitty road even driver road weather condition could probably think long list thing there huge difference automated elevator vehicle mean afraid technology seems like one thing someone trying fix something isnt broken also happens tech point inevitably fails mean iv trapped elevator hour cause failure die human error im totally fine would turning grave knew died cause something safe malfunctioned something
drive semi living im long haul im month time id say vehicle pas high level distraction going nobody paying attention need self driving vehicle asap
head semi truck probably one first vehicle automated company
ashmystic really hope first one go one providing value company include semi vehicle pas paying attention well really look forward driverless vehicle haul hazmat cryo tank ill personally help develop reliable technology make job safer everyone reliable fwiw current safety technology semi isnt good doesnt seem recognize problem sudden stop partial load liquid ive auto brake come going around corner guaranteed recipe rollover ive also react shadow road causing sudden braking reason load shift
removing parking lot massive selling point many resource land space time wasted parking lot live closer together
become human trusting tech tech trusting human
shame sponsored waymo id prefer intelligent self impartial report ep tesla latest fsd beta recommend beta tester excellent experience excellent knowledge tesla fsd
wont driverless car make buying car pointless therefore destroy million job potentially crash economy
also automate job million trucktaxidelivery driver part larger trend artificial intelligence automating job including professional job like doctor lawyer engineer well likely need universal basic income keep capitalism game going eventually evolve whole new postcapitalist economy whether crash transforms depend reactive leader society changing technology many disruptive technology like invention car telephone computer internet etc adapted seem like pace increasing
thanks visiting best state arizona hope liked
end said work work way home said something fun followed saying ya maybe sleeping thats clear sign shes overworked lost touch feel kinda bad
younger human course support ive hated driving ever since learned got lisense cant wait till human driving become illegal u dumb ape ruin everything long live ai
icy road im end man whole career
think year worth driving car never encountered icy road people comment section seem believe theyve thought thing engineer worked car decade never thought
monkiram youtube comment allowed preferred dumbjokes people would hate critically serious comment section least also system hasnt road literal year probably tested car ice bad icy road rob control even experienced driver
andrewmynhier im referring calculated number hour car spent driving gather data equivalent average person driving year yeah sorry came aggressively lol know mostly joke
im autonomous car road option people think little farfetched predict autonomous car replace manual car eventually comparing apple orange put side side elevator aircraft thing naturally progressed autonomy made sense environment purpose true good autonomous car safer human driver time time computer fall short human judgement feel frustrating human involved car developed culture differently elevator aircraft everyday machine average citizen car personal people always desire handson experience personal machine everyday computer building computer gotten popular year despite greater technology lot people like prebuilt computer lot people love self driving car thats fine really dont think trading personal experience safety catch everyone
would like autonomous car actual driver road anymore everyone used driverless car
world first fully autonomous vehicle wrong maybe fully autonomous car fully autonomous train rocket subway subway exited long time
even waymo figured giving credit due lot company dont tesla try get away limited discrete sensor arent ever going provide enough current hardware live pittsburgh see argo testing vehicle town time cant count often stop suddenly turn obvious reason granted havent seen crash even waymo working working arizona flat featureless grid road practically snow rain try anywhere hill winding road vegetation partially obstructing view game place im sure eventually get say work sterile condition bit optimistic
autopilot aviation different autonomous car know sky mostly empty space crossroad lane pedestrian parking little amount vehicle sky detect object far far away using onboard radar driverless car future never
curious question denmark elevator country actually still stopbutton ive never seen one europe country ive travelled outside europe always thought hollywoodgimmick
oh boy jillion camera detection equipment along proprietary software computing hardware upkeep like manually driven manual transmission car thanks maybe im old infirm
real magic happens autonomous car start using standard datasharing format communicate fly enough effectively say crash happen car road would get news plenty warning every car would progressive controlled slowing diversion would occur without honking yelling panicked human error
curious vehicle would wyoming blizzard concern around technology human element impossible prove eliminated big brother tracking every move feel like huge security risk come privacy
uber buy
like selfrespecting video game level waimo manages beat final bos vito try drive safely autonomously italy survive joke aside great video would love see everywhere autonomous vehicle even tomorrow
made bet friend five year ago would take year could buy fully autonomous car technology regulation im totally winning bet unfortunately
probably cost there way thats affordable pacifica
chainringcalf affordable part bet
hell nah driving fun part life
reminds video door ai space station stopping human accidentally suffocating space job open close door think ai one best thing human safety especially road
conceptually absolutely love idea driverless car hope society get practically speaking absolutely love driving im passive safe driver driving back forth work long trip see family whatever absolutely love control car would hate giving simple pleasure
dont think poll accurately represented personally meant year see car dominance poor road condition lawmaker insurance think many technology ready today
dr strange
wan na try car indian road lol
said people questioning autonomous car reaction case choosing baby nun think thats stupid pretext reject autonomous car imagine youre situation like car within split second hell capability choose save first think car power calculate statistic human first instinct reaction doesnt take account human drug influence
people saying bad weather people stop middle road cause raining heavy lol
im sure
talk king corruption car suddenly drive cliff try visit family member state king say lockdown
people would drive could sleep getting destination
wow crazy cool one caveat unemployed driver reason livable ubi
weird question changed average human average driver
really picked chryslers autonomous car
ur right k lambos
google owns youtube google owns waymo waymo sponsor video video titled want driverless car road look veritasium one favorite channel im actually largely favor driverless car ridiculous conflict interest certainly objective unbiased journalism
look like ok car suburb arizona people trying actively rob
full disclosure live suburb arizona people actively trying rob also near waymo headquarters whatever testing facility visited saw waymo van trying make left turn parking lot onto four lane road semi truck trying make right turn access point parking lot would room till van moved truck driver trying wave van clear guess lidar didnt detect apparently wasnt work around software turn right make u turn block autonomous vehicle flawed long human driven vehicle exist
take two turn trust human driving still dont trust dad fully im
could lidar interfere autonomous car lidar
happens either lidar camera powerful computer computer get wear year
presumably there maintenance schedule dont trust corporation actually keep maintenance unless theyre forced like airline
problem driverless car socialistic one matter safety ability create driverless car lack foresight see affect peoplethe workforce globally
would love work yet although tesla latest beta release confident month ago said elon right one thing simulation mile next useless building realistic simulation real world harder building software flawless full self driving
wow capitalistic nonsolution end would benefit fuckin advanced futuristic okay fair technology useful applied manner
would love live autonomous diving world young adult go bar without deciding friend designated driver night
take uber strike going see autonomous car soon
imagine year old licensed drive jumping one thing say take grand canyon
amount folk see driving freeway looking phone thing cant come soon enough like driving requires focus attention thing people dont seem lot
everything true including survey yes selfdriving car work typical condition already exist indeed drive safely human yes indeed decade selfdriving car drive accidentfree completelyarbitrary condition arbitrary start point arbitrary end point taking route never driven arbitrary weather condition arbitrary traffic condition road construction defaced traffic sign etc phenomenally difficult problem
problem plane example yes three dimension v two condition flying plane weather bad two thing favor machine plane complicated machine different type camera see different condition better driverless car worry poorly mapped location construction detour pedestrian cyclist cyclable city driver stoplight going know isnt hard trick current ai recognize stop sign condition favor human flying plane may wait land airspace busy something favor human solution isnt difficult imagine however dont think case necessarily driverless car shortcoming also dont think safety report phoenix necessarily representative reason well mapped id bet bottom dollar careful stay completely date also cgp grey video traffic never come true always drivable car completely eradicate possibility traffic flowing fast huge engineering task never mind pedestrian want cross unless change way plan city cyclist also navigate traffic let clear see u fully autonomous driving future dont think take long however seeing far theyve come past year think take longer future realized mean includes slow regulator well still
advertisement getting really long
know infrastructure would prohibitively expensivebut griddedelectrified road think minority report could electric self driving car need massive battery pathingtraffic could controlled massive computer could pull electricity directly road instead paying gas pay power used grid driving
wasnt great watch learning drive great video though
like idea safety purpose im sure describe much love driving would much sad person behind wheel
requirement waymo sponsorship generally trust ive excited autonomous car year trusting video depends much influence waymo
programmer think happens bad glitch get uploaded thousand car happen also unlikely scenario autonomous vehicle put road likely become odds winning lottery unlikely one win almost every week million chance becomes certainty million car road plane le plane sky car ground still pilot take control something actually go wrong
even car fail every due random unlikely case still likely much safer human drive even dont absolutely eliminate crash still minimize
really cool hope prevents accident p also noticed lety brazillian accent
cant wait autonomous car
driving every condition possible year accident free achieve metric give call p car cant hacked turned guided missile people inside
man know amazing driverless car know much fun drive car revving engine shift gear
someone gotten accident due drowsiness wish autonomous car day least one lane keep assist something im honestly lucky alive thing like would obviously occur driverless car
sooooo ready bring
point time autonomous vehicle choose victim make public hesitant decide rule industry chooses u
issue dont trust selfdriving car dumb driver around u observe someone driving behavior predict intension base observation ready next move choose speed pas dont feel safe around driver dogged many many potential accident thatsocal computersai predict action like reaction passenger big unknow would take selfdriving driver assist function every car road selfdriving able communicate trust
man accent knew lety brazilian even saw name googled
stop removing human operation society doesnt become chock full lazy people dont know anything
trained phoenix itll probably best worst
answer stern reply
another thing come mind autonomous vehicle possible may possible achieve fabled flying car standard option
foresee worry future almost car come self driving capability people become clinical sterile soccer momish driving initially start certain stretch road designated mandatory autonomous driving safety gradually expanding include road mandatory autonomous driving point human driving car becomes like smoking today sort dirty taboo hate see happen headed
need public transportation
one concern people might would happen autonomous car get hacked passenger captive person hacking car measure make car least hackerresistant
modest proposal given distracted driving duo two main cause accident revoke driver license people convicted traffic offense year ride bus use uber wait fully autonomous car available youre car driving must priority dont deserve privilege license
agreed fully
yeap one thing problem alot people drive even license unless kill someone unlikey going get anything apart modest fine mentality behind country worth fineing someone something cant afford
year way long thats half decade whole teenager age certain point youre punishing big punishment sake research doesnt support arbitrarily large sentence mind simply register large beforehand therefore doesnt work preventative
penalty prevent people driving know many people driven close decade without valid license
similar idea actually already place washington distracted driving law set beyond necessary near absurdity even speculation acknowledged law designed remove dangerous driver behind wheel autonomous vehicle introduced
im definitely average driver haha see excited car road driverless car make everything predictable entire highway road limit people driving allow autonomous car hope get keep driving whole life maybe another year know wouldnt mind driven around robot either
isnt illegal need human operate vehicle seat legal
one issue future fully autonomous carsa significant reduction human organ donorsalmost human organ donor come million people die human error car accident let hope printing organ tech get better
ive seen type car literally everyday people still dont know childhood dream like real
childhood dream hippie van
think dream flying car
garmatey exist
nikosucksatskating specifically blue red hippy van word mystery machine spray painted side
garmatey nah flying car boomer dream self driving car real deal
hope enjoyed stay phoenix cool know near city ive seen waymo car driving around former coworker used work
know taxi riot aint fun theyve burning uber car cant wait see autonomous vehicle may people employed taxi driver chauffeur united state million uber driver come autonomous truck driving thats another million truck driver delivery driver thats looot folk going business
one concern would handle rural poorly upkept road
fact matter though autonomous car basically improvement normal car congratulation mobility without needing control vehicle vehicle still spaceinefficient powerhungry also expensive regular car hear could build selfdriving car expect move many people set selfdriving vehicle follow specific route specific checkpoint since route fixed might well enshrine hard infrastructure make guidance easier way something conical wheel roundtopped beam side made steel make guidance passive allowing ton simplification driving controller since selfdriving vehicle extremely predictable path make electric actually feed electric power external power supply using sliding contact along powered wire rail saving weight battery whatnot hold think invented selfdriving tram regular tram selfdriving selfdriving car solve traffic problem better public transit last line important ill say selfdriving car solve traffic problem better public transit
happen municipality fully grasp much money save requiring fully autonomous vehicle within city limit insurance saving alone stagger mind course take saving use retrain taxi driver automechanics insurance agent ubi anyone
prediction closer year cost investment business actually make fleet car launch higher even technology already exists uber lyft door dash grub hub etc relied existing car launchexpand business could get started software contrast sharedrequested vehicle return taxi cab business model business owning maintaining entire fleet physical vehicle massive asset investment car depot property etc red tape logistical practical problem make harder launch business granted large corporation like google would advantage paying initial cost rushing obstacle also limit contestant new race mean le pressure rush im also worried state local lawmaker le technical expertise hesitant pave way business practice unmanned car street heck im still waiting google fiber internet come area tech existed awhile

live minnesota curious car would handle snow ice road
egyptian yeah happening
safe animal like dog cat
love potential thing driver cant think drafting inch apart highway could huge reduction fuelenergy transportation industry could get work vehicle driver ho restriction parking lot could literally bumper bumper since driver open door get car common network could let know breakdown change lanesmerge without cutting anyone would huge elimination rush hour road construction traffic
there one moral question wasnt adressed ok say instead million people getting killed get half million killed one responsible half million likeley get following scenario technology could get improved doesnt coroporations incentive theyre responsible people car kill much incentive propper quality control either traffic death like everything else become company statistic treated capitalist frame work cost reward company would required better average human could run car produced billionaire prefers make cheaper car worry life nobody responsible hand making company accountable every person car kill difficult put practice
preciselythere lot ting wrong def one
anna yo check vid dont understand point scenario posit state moral problem even driverless car perform better
people easily average prioritize various driving skill different way anyone else noticed pandemic yet public health department prioritized death rate others prioritized icu occupancy hospital admission diagnostic rate employment even load management smoothing surge medical demand rather aggregate number selfreported performance could easily add probably might right
uber driver watching rn
great piece thanks much putting together invests alphabet immediately
im excited autonomous driving think boring would sitting car youve used phone played game tried sleep minute commute take long car autonomous alone autonomous car get boring
technically majority people average driver driver scale driver score driver score average driver score think median going
oh come youre good th technology merely something bench model making technology fit mass consumption entirely different fish problem autonomous car big problem energy consumption edge processing reduces car mileage energy guzzling computational system cheap either doesnt necessarily work many driving condition
invest tram
theyll probably need emergency service call trigger someone stop moving back seat seizure well alarm wake sleeping passenger idea able read write every car ride without keeping eye quickly relative applying brake sound wonderful
speeding dont kill depend
cop want pull
shockingly bad video veritasium im sure waymo pay content big reason comparing automated car elevator really event automated flight much controlled predictable environment urban street scene induced demand like adding lane freeway automated car create congestion hacking threat car another system waiting taken nefarious hacking group demanding ransom prevent deadly crash car ever work place like suburban u arizona little regard livability versus car dominance real solution traffic fatality building urban area dont require car really simple
one major concern must suppose drive road human driver elevator operate highly controlled environment cant really crash pedestrian problem many thing apply aircraft ground control unlikely encounter unexpected obstacle like pedestrian perhaps light aircraft low altitude allowed place commercial plane low altitude like around airport car driverless behave way another able predict wont many accident regulated standard behave way period driverless humandriven vehicle problem know
one friend killed car walking side road crazy would alive self driving one always human error
think imagine extremely hypothetical scenario help u solve complicated problem worst tool make quick decision
quick decision opposite come self driving car ai
id curious handle bike people crossing quickly erratically drunk driver something unexpected deer run across lane closed tough believe ready handle random event even perfect weather condition
know people complaining video sponsored youll biased softspoken video wouldnt even exist soon without sponsorship better sugarcoated never much later imo
im driverless car unrelated note im considering ability car fooled specifically sound real ambulance v similar even replecated sound also talked wasted production car sit arent used would worry car local kia factory destroyed maintain price car
actually way advanced technology could imagined hopefully near future wont pay thousand driver license least france pretty expensive
seeing crazy karen uber driver sure would wonder cope driverless vehicle
thank video
technology like amazing narcolepsy careful drive really limit freedom hangout friend late night thing would fall asleep driving im happy technology im excited become cheaper cheaper
year place without steering wheel driver input goal remove user driving experience remove person belonging ownership people car rented also another note people home either new world order born serve top make bottom slave trade think great vaccination planned smart grid system backed blockchain reality grim like prison planet
yua erhatip yes dumbest people cop supporting enslavement enslavement future kid
feel like would want sit driver seat people dont freak look see driver
great video however think real problem selfdriving car trust internet could imagine able interact stranger part world playing game together business trust principle go selfdriving car except stake go higher maximum possible loss internet money whereas could loss life fatal car accident reason people comfortable take ride driver vehicle trust dont trust selfdriving car enough moment changing people belief hard may take year time tell another reason liability sense control well implemented selfdriving car statistically safer average human driver order magnitude problem different failure mode decade experience people familiar vast majority cause accident human driver speeding fatigue duo blame driver accident happens familiar accident selfdriving car software bug sensor malefaction hacking importantly blame familiarity give people false sense security whereas unfamiliarity leaf room conspiracy theory despite obvious statistical fact psychologically preclude wider adoption selfdriving car
cant imagine even wanting car experience similar elevator experience elevator meant take point point b thats think video missing another value freedom drive go want stop want want discover knew place buy making unprepared turn mountain stop side road turn new path life worth lived one freedom spontaneous fully autonomous vehicle remove
opinion autonomous car full
agree dereks thesis selfdriving car however lately video poorly edited lot repetition much explanation obvious point video could minute long
make accident public k camera
thats one thing sound good paper probably would lead clickbait autonomous card ready
stevenluoma would trust could see accident really fault
bydiz would actually go find side story though listen people retellings even everyone else
worried make dad lose job uber countless others
snow
uncomfortable idea corrupt government able control nation traffic level every single car kinda corruption wasnt concern yah sure driverless would better manual driving could always exist somewhere else
problem freedom move removed individual look utility company turning people ac peak hour smart thermostat
lidar still blow mind
know lidar still functioning well enough heavy rain switch using radar work better situation
lot ongoing research area still think
idea getting stuck traffic jam surrounded empty car lol
ha acura mdx hood open human driver sheesh
work city highway thats would think
haha selfdriving car could pull traffic still safer human driver
ok im technology nobody dy car accident cure cancercan planet even handle people yep mar come
fine dandy consider thing like car would probably connected internet time someone could takeover car cruse say crash tree kidnap someone could use selfdriving steal car similar fashion well responsible car part crash owner designer manufacturer person inside vehicle constant surveillance etc provided car given constant internet connection massive amount data taken car certain government corporation would know everything car also would something rule manufacturer example take car unauthorized repair shop could nicely tell car disable even drive authorized repair shop xd mean ridiculous dangerous multiple reason current electric smart car giving autonomy probably worst thing could would trust car wait left would physically disconnect battery would constantly nervous someone take either feed trash data making crash something else oh analogy elevator soooooo far away autonomous car like comparing boat train go airplane much easier even land mention pilot empty sky given little variable comparison say busy city street like video worldview part either failed think favour someone onesided view
oh oh derek outstanding work one brother seriously goosebump thought vehicle know couple guy working software trust thing without batting eyelash point speculative impact video like widespread adoption much hate term influencer largely due part equation pertains label let choose random purely hypothetical example well call carlson wait thats obvious well call tucker c frankly irresponsiblyignorant fear pose actual threat time employing apropos done sense relieved gratitude thank one thing like progress like made small part due contribution influencers like thank mman youre good work
thats wanted hear want everyone hear
okay heard im keepin manually driven stickshift car
loved video main concern happens post accident autonomous car get sideswiped loss th sensor got rear ended couldnt avoid car get launched another car thing mess driver hopefully system able apply brake safely
remove dash steering wheel turn front seat around make bench maybe add foldable table self driving party room
talkin short limo
yes level robotaxis perfect limo move people nightclub hotel restaurant airport etc already plenty level bus using layout seat people usually limited around kmh around short fixed loop km increasing speed like kmh max route length ten kilometer one hour seating people would perfect type urban taxi use would also outcompete awful electric scooter overcrowding sidewalk
robot friend
self driving camper van youre talking
id fine longer commute rode autonomous car mean could live center city save lot money think lot people would feel way housing shortage high demand area would become milder
hacking system isnt danger video didnt mention
think human becoming worse driver correct started automatic transmission reducing driver workload radio didnt create distraction cassette cd mp car driver assist everyone smartphone noone paying attention
wtf automatic transmission us
invisible driver set belt something happens
cant scale technology virtual driver assistance taking waymo vehicle given time
""
autonomous vehicle scare crap dont expect work well snow
thank continuously making content support best idea human race think may one greatest creator time
forgot talk million people whose job driving taxi driver truck driver train driver bus driver delivery driver ambulance driver rubbish truck driver job soon
really like comparison elevator actually make much sense
yep like elevator car travel dedicated lane issue stop there one path car take never car private path
whats need steering wheel
aviation enthusiast would like see take automated flight mention one case pro con reason case decision makin process pilot actually saved situation case software issue caused accident honestly cant imagine car driving miami problem personally prepare mentally drive hialeah see future car enthusiast actually love drive pilot actually love fly commercial passenger flight isnt kind aviation commercial pilot
wheres fun another household appliance
fyi lidar doesnt allow driving outside precisely mapped geofenced location tesla hit billion mile real world driving data sure tesla doesnt sponsor anybody pay advertising theyre one whore going truly autonomous taxi fleet year
amen hope never teach daughter drive car seriously think moral dilemma actually facing havent already replaced commuter car autonomous vehicle there huge potential save human life cost unnecessary damage repair
ok really think computer able account stupidity human perhaps every car self driving would take human error also well would offroad could car get smart enough dodge make advanced maneuver keep passenger safe like dodging car dealing person road rage fully autonomous misleading title
narcolepsy thats mild enough still drive scary im even little bit tired cant drive often get stuck place choose go able take short nap car drive would make huge difference lower chance sleep attack get destination
happens lot driverless car road see car lidar know light light
thanks promoting tech accepted wonder grew driverless car would feel comfortable around next generation could well like
driverless car nah mind controlled car
derek youre canada probably know winter driving like autonomous car winnipeg winter
driver talk excellent service customer service
really great exciting watch yet another futuristic technology begin integrate society regardless seamless technology becomes always people simply like drive one people also people buy nice car like porsche something else great driving dynamic dont buy car drive unless technology becomes widely available much cheaper feature currently see certain vehicle dedicated specifically used fully self driving car technology becomes easier cheaper integrate every day car im interested hear people think actually using technology would drive car dont feature could see using regularly
puzzled rise topically walk tramp seemingly spell debonair romanian impartial racial kenya
sound like robot
face say say anything human suck
really love episode understand well people right talk year technology complete basic technology okay need approx year experience try hard technical support deployed big city certainly big
offroading snowy flooded road rural area without sign gravel road technology look really cool used city still think impossible creat intersection without traffic light shown video major problem pedestrian
one negative side selfdriving car would increase traffic volume necessarily time spent traffic lot people commute work get work done hop kid people dont drive single passenger travel would increase bad would interesting seeing public transport service incorporate feature reduce overall emission caused traffic
insurance industry professional think one main hurdle widespread adoption technology going complicated mess legal liability human driver relatively easy assign fault thus civilcriminal liability given accident small fraction collision need fault determined court process process get lot complicated automated system get involved accident occur two automated vehicle liable hardware manufacturer installing faulty sensor software developer allowing bug system fails notice sensor faulty human riding comfortably distracted behind wheel failing intervene override faulty automated system law book definitively answer question uncertainty liability going severely limit number company willing assume risk company going care le many accident prevented liable accident remain cant achieve former without first understanding latter
take step back look western culture see full b
dont like idea fully autonomous car lose degree freedom
meanwhile dont want get driver license cuz know would shitty driver
others already pointed american obsessed autonomous car never used well functioning public transit system expert intermodal mobility say autonomous car wont solve problem mobility better public transit better bike infrastructure way important get sustainable mobility
laser beam like cancer beam future conservative
minute long ad driverless car
else searching waymo robinhood
waymo km per disengagement average human developed country km per crash cant yet say av drive better human average
derek av cant distracted artificial attention mechanism let u introduce
would lidar started raining especially sudden summer downpour highway must hard train
imagine year written book used people driving vehicle got amazed hearing fact use driver elevator
feel like one big advert comparing human sens hardware spec ai training time driver training time etc feel bit dishonest im exciting technology worthy wide scale adoption comparison apple orange
mean simple driverless elevator
im looking forward self driving car people good driving car including time people getting enough sleep even drink drive
f thought video older
happens get struck lightning
blind seeing problem whole topic course dont want car shut distance government also give information location dont know every time start
im wondering many nightmare cgp grey
car lidar coexist information overload one car noise lidar deal wouldnt data corruption happen ie sensor getting data direct emmitters without bouncing item
people disliking video collided stationary self driving car
driving fun get country lane let rip much boring highway
still enjoy driving though id rather car pay small amount gas every week pay every time get car isnt even mine
way ever feel comfortable driverless car around ever buy one engaged driver vehicle pure joy
someone listens malcolm gladwells podcast revisionist history dont
yes love podcast
one point contention already getting rid parking lot making city greener walkable self driving car nice thing safety shouldnt act like theyre going fix urban design thats totally separate issue start fixing today investing walkable bikeable infrastructure comprehensive public transit
poor soul sacrifice dedicated driver drunken idiot friend anymore
issue safety issue freedom live american suburb effectively trapped without car whether hacker oppressive government power simply turn people ability move much abuse potential
driver license brain donor card except donate brain die
point autonomous vehicle like stepping inside elevator misleading sure elevator longer driver become driver elevator today autonomous user still hit button elevator get floor want anything elevator driver autonomous user back change
derek hello thank much ur video im kazakhstan watching ur video russian want say thanks interesting channel question car said car camera maybe camera dont working world smart intellectual scientist bad people destroy camera big problem think government car good dont give patient hospital money big plan thanks attention
yes listen much better people cant drive real computer drive become boring king insurance need something going wrong wrong comp comp damn man keep thing afraid stay home mask mouth en shut sry bad english
drink still get home comfortably
airplane autopilot driverless car vastly different scope driverless car require autonomous decision airplane fly course set closely monitored pilot apple orange
sure independent company compete one another car want communicate one point another ideal year away
want see driverless car autocross andor race track speed even drifting inch wall
like idea autonomous car without steering wheel reserved seat system know far cry think extra interior space could utilize without dashboard steering wheel
yeah could extra space single passenger look
may plan terminator first make u believe thing destroy u joke hahahahahahaha
trust car fear human driver kinda wish fully automated road believe transition way slower elevator seeing many guy consider theyre car theyre dick nobody pride ego involved elevator
need legally blind also functioning member society cant take job close public transportation
aboyt driver around world lose jobes technology happened many technology mention downside technology affect life
video sponsored subject video thats called minute advertisement derek
autonomous vehicle least perspective user already exists called public transport sleep work commuting also much environmentally friendly individual car reduce amount traffic instead adding put brain money work making better shared public transportation rather individual selfish autonomous car
car hacked
whole video seems pr video man overly stated positive may save lot life personally personally see may provide le put freedom regard life responsibility surveillance overreliance technology turn making u le functionable skill orientated specie see one many thing technology slowly replace u first know next cooking food thought essentially become useless human future seen walle seems really orwellian personally felt seemed excited new technology due seemed speak negative
may video coming future someone bet car isnt driving
hate people believe better average le average answered people right never got point question people accurate assessment driving skill isnt really headline fact people better machine good driver generell whole story better average doesnt mean anything
derek state driver cause accident conclusion error impossible machine make thats implying factor human error removed software tell always scenario combined possible sensor fault etc software developer never ever thought sense factor human error built software look boeing max accident take detailed look uber accident woman bicycle killed self driving car tempe arizona im saying driver le car wont happen im saying casualty ok
nice reckless drinker alcoholic saving program
dont know happened yet double blind study use identical car self driving however passenger wont able see human driver present making driver seat blocked car way passenger report thought humanrobot driver right wrong without biased could also work placebo effect driverless car passenger told driver cant see see fell comfortable consider inhuman driving behaviour see behaviour better average driver worse
used dream thing like kidteenager initially applied bus envisioned beacon system wouldve made thing impossibly expensive geonumerated radio beacon wouldve put road simple radiowave measured vehicle wouldve become massive infrastructure project couldve also done car vehicle reverse obviously optimal way sensor vehicle road like vision crude idea make work year ago essentially idea lidar simply bounce light measure travel time concept around age current state technology miniaturised efficient electronics actually possible also long ago devised minimal efficient way create car would essentially carlike pod similar one video idea mainly use pod railway moving train lot energyconsuming pod kg person inside want go different place person next efficiency increase creating minipersonalised train instead huge common one modifying railway bit could done track would become lane pod could go high speed overtake others stopping different station trip quicker energy efficient well getting thing car awesome see lot mini crazy idea ive become true notsogreat side havent able act capitalise make real oops
nice kinda advert fails address real issue driverless car bring mentioned issue place poorer quality road never addressed question cost replace car rich person toy really focus special circumstance whetherhow vulnerable car exploitation ever break rule road could criminal stand front force stop rob occupant car getting hacked malicious agent question actually owning car ability control software walledgarden constant fee privacy many camera hacked people tracked
disappointingly uncritical felt like repeating pr material rather interrogating problem video merely sponsored waymo actively commissioned
note cat iii autolanding mean airport appropriate equipment support aircraft also appropriate equipment equivalent car would ensuring every intersection meet design rule every road properly surfaced line marked consistently speed restriction properly signposted obstruction masking sign traffic signal view around corner corner tighter say radius pedestrian traffic
actually started think tech college like year ago reason behind hit car think subconsciously fear getting road
car put would communicate would thing crash car know car would would like whole network car would know others move
yeah wifibluetooth never problem either wireless technology sure errorproof
jimpy lol never said wifi would work together network like iphones iphones connect iphones find sooooo car could potentially thing
jimpy id sincerely doubt theyd run one communication sensor much sense redundancy tier communication especially cheap bluetoothwifig sensor would likely backup copy tier extra sensor lot cheaper lawsuit theyd get overlooking
jimpy wifi easily get hacked though
want see size server farm
argument gon na say people find driving fun exciting mention possible cost self driving car compared used yr old car doubt would make safer right find driving something want sometime future would nothing using vehicle waymo
main concern driverless car giving lot right machine car kill want end day program hackable
funny thing live society vehicle controlled human make driverless car job way hard would never developed regular car begin think wouldnt need traffic light sign car wouldnt need react human something stupid car would exist hive mind theyd know aregoing go human road technology actually get le complicated
automation fine good ideal situation automated car road safer since machine easily coordinate point say human better would undefinable scenario machineswhich rare unless frontier trekking
everything gon na go
good first see benefit especially city like swarm form mass transit even service suburb bad like led bulb video gave interesting history planned obsolescence came rail sang praise led bulb longevity cited marketer practically never last even close long advertised video sings praise selfdriving technology without addressing issue oversimplifying question many life save based small scale use example label negligent criminal behavior simply distracted self driving car solve problem people road rest practice human interaction
piss tho fact eventually theyll become norm driving experience thing past enjoy driving
well miss able chat dan elevator operator building
grow
well driving enthusiast could guardian mode driving ai interrupt something dangerous although realistic enjoy driving moment realise play game car instead something always allowed drive track moment really want
move somewhere snow half year theyll never function
chakatstormcloud tesla already okish fully snow covered road human dont special organ give u advantage car many sensor give advantage u gps dont care snow year snow problem
willing give car sound like people wouldnt give horse carriage
get might useful suburban area big city invest public transportation
driverless car going like new technology people dont understand theyre always wary first personal experience seeing work wariness disappears take granted said im technology sooner come better
need look mercedes started autonomous vehicle
autonomous vehicle eventually reduce traffic jam maybe eliminate traffic light work seamlessly automobile thanks video
legally blind
know get driver road providing public transit driverless car big tech solution problem solved year ago locomotive
autonomous shuttle public transit
dont believe split second driverless car solve traffic public transportation probably even safer driverless car said part solutionmostly term last resort accessibility
hell milion km thousand year
handle rural dirt road match surrounding adverse road condition like traffic barrel hell area tell lane clearly snow ice enough rain lift oil water road unknown depth major pot hole crowd spilled blocking part road wide farm equipment narrow road oncoming overtaking etc think see large city long general availability would also love see rollout certain areasroad type require autonomous driving
really enjoy act driving seen odd hiccup software package contains nearly line code seriously go wrong
interesting amazing technology take part promoting use singleuser car time becoming clear climate change requires u let go luxury people need start using bike walking public transportation even electric car panacea coeq emission regular car complete lifecycle still high time become aware act accordingly least consider climate change problem worth solving
every car self driven accident would happened unfortunately thats reality
somehow doubt least asstated
seat belt safe
chance car computer could like controlled outside
safety compromised
think said ready thinking nonideal condition way would trust thing rain night like india
waymo cool impressive cant see constant lidarmap issue scalable update hdmaps freakquently doable small area world constantly dont think thats going economical year time tesla might cracked problem without hdmaps expeccially dojo huge fleet sending real world data train training simulation know im exited see next year anyhow
man thats india except highway
skeptic driverless car unsafe driverless driver seat seatbelt buckled
yah realise thats keep factoryinstalled safety mechanism happy right modified production vehicle purposebuilt autonomous
christopherbedford yea joke good point
maybe driverless car totally fine definitely dont trust corporation behind lmao
well done piece love presentation style info follow deeper tech dive
driverless elevator adopted otis elevator lobbied achieved minimum wage made expensive keep elevator driver payroll upgrade driverless thousand people lost job otis could make bunch money driverless elevator would adopted time otis used power legislature put lot low skilled worker work progressive
simply content stunning
think le people trusting technology people trusting company develop technology silicon valley hive privacy invasion marxism corruption unpleasantness people afraid think back brilliant video facebook stealing video
im sad see derek lending car lobby
cant trust car wouldnt hacked
think may handle road type adverse weather condition
computer way better driver human ideal situation
accident fault
short distance awesome long distance cost need adequate service need widespread support scenario like taking ferry long distance would imagine freight train cool solution car would get loaded get transported travel hub end hub closest destination start driving
sharing economy solving lot issue fewer car street le traffic le traffic stop accident people spend lot money buying owning car money could saved something important dont need car reflect wealth
perhaps silly missing point cant see autonomy would lead le traffic fewer car certainly le traffic would expect traffic blind people drunk child could suddenly participate instead stay home walk use public transport share opportunity cost driving would also reduce almost nothing removing disincentive travel take child visit grandparent one hour away car wouldnt often didnt entail two hour actual driving increasing traffic scenario dad go amusement park please cant ive got important work take long get cant work way please increasing traffic scenario dad really want go party please fare hire waymo go back later fewer car trip expect
peterjansen fewer car people would share vehicle like public transport instead one person owning car ride alone car could filled people going direction two scenario could work scenario two would dont ride passenger
besprutad thank theory could work could ride sharing large dont would take would site doesnt send autonomous car still consolidates trip perhaps site actually exists isnt used much introduced became part requesting autonomous vehicle think people would take offer
one question car take place driver drive living
website computer allowed access website road hmmmm
single extreme event beat back decade similarly happened nuclear power existing autonomous car handle road rage someone try run one road outside car ai training likely stop psycho kill passenger wont accept self driving car another generation
ore take train bus walk ore cycle
love driving spend actual time deliberate practice people nut driving people suck easily distracted think driverless car definitely way go however hope isnt legal restriction choosing drive vehicle ie sport car motorcycle
younger people love since mean devote travel time playing phone
rafetizer based comment guessing ish probably young enough arent naysaying self driving car yet old enough opinion today young people xd
jamesa lol yep went work breakrooms people paying attention room full smart phone zombie
idea self driving car close
hey thanks cool video man actually learned lot always watch video also sorry rude people comment think good job looking stuff unbiased point view
one thing frightens progress video like often show overly optimistic view technology consideration risk past decade weve least one massive hacking operation thats taken whole economic sector day resulting hefty logistical trouble loss million dollar earth would want entirety driving sector run autonomous network connected vehicle yes get human arent great driver know also difficult hack instead maybe could dont know improve public transportation sector specialist driver try limit private driving much possible technology great long account danger accounting danger led several nuclear disaster narrowly avoided one optimism good naivety
see point sadly dont believe human difficult hack otherwise almost politician would starve death phone call get scammer professional hacker people theyd business bulk msm cerebral malware thousand expensive religion one true devotee hacked drastically become suicide bomber scout movement turn child little american school system turn little soviet brain plasticity mean even lot human hardware result decade exposure expert hacker
phoenix profile indeed country little snow human driver usually insufficient experience cope actually phoenix would probably find hard software automatic car gathered climate zone autonomous car probably cope well good professional driver northern canada norway however snowchains required able tell still fit incidentally open profile found nothing except beautiful picture
imagine implication keeping schedule could set schedule car could come pick drop work appointment time everyday
there waymo people going trust robo car already killed many people one many make everything way simpler x easier make brake assistance speed limiter mandatory car would benefit full automatic driver still simple enough make practical fully safe full automation bad idea kiss method always win
dont want get driver license sound like pain middle university
didnt talk cost
indian russian middleeastern people seeing pathetic
working software engineer always would trust good system human driver thing im scared hacker cant tell taxi driver hit everything unfortunately could software guess way hard risk reason though everything hacked today hacking traffic light could cause accident cant wait im mostly bike hate car driver driving car im always pissed everyone driving badly
would great would upload fps

hope driverless vehicle mean increase speed limit speaking speed limit imagine there lot resistance government money make traffic violation
million mile thats like second tesla
yeah cant amount data
okay like driving one coping mechanism allows process certain emotion reaction also truly enjoy driving far never accident crash ive never situation endangered others autonomy happens im pretty fearful one thing truly enjoy would effectively removed whether want hope push full automation come there still way allow standard car road person drive willing take extra test effectively prove im safe enough continue drive road long still drive
dont trust selfdriving car dumb people none selfdriving car dont trust
thing would worry getting driverless car seeing steering wheel driverless car fully automated perfectly safe also take control case go rogue decides play little gta dont worry hardly ever
future good argument shouldnt implemented avoid traffic driver error bad driver hundred thousand avoidable death etc argument hear people scared technology let honestly scared driving around bunch human wheel would love come time didnt need driver license could automated car another thing well would limit even eliminate gross amount animal killed traffic whether domestic wild break heart whenever see dead animal road
fully functional single city sunny arizona doesnt build much faith tbh also appealing idea could significantly change number car road true
dont want spoil te fun tecnhology safer welcome almost percent working american driver gon na tough feed people job soon realize tecnhonoly never evil pushing towards political system reform order survide automization think lower hour job pay sadly knowing capitalism human greed ought starve change happens
think cyberpunk delamain company
aera france dont think autonomous car drive much chaos
though love idea fully autonomous vehicle private camera scanner microphone
im hard time picturing driverless elevator could possibly collide another elevator unlike autopiloted plane autonomous car wont mile apart road mainly point made people bad driver car autonomous ill happy driven one although honesty computer would probably handle emergency situation better would anyway one final objection someone passenger front seat england rather uncomfortable driver seat control vehicle imagine youd get feeling fairly quickly though speaking waymo driver seat whats steering wheel
want drink
near future im bored im going switch car manual drive bit wtf crazy stay away control youre going hit something dont pay attention
exactly
like irobot already point trust computer automated machine human nearperfect functioning imagine everything automated would challenge
pretty expensive drive insurance
well yea even reach point since global warming
basically happened beginnertomidlevel programming
autonomous vehicle understand know traffic cop middle intersection blow whistle point motion turn right wave hand shake leg
basically pr waymo possible everything derek say video true trust say
lot part world wouldnt work
tried tesla fsd
stop designing city car design people walkable
keep telling people computer react faster far greater precision ever could true average human reaction time millisecond may seem like lot time computer recognize situation run number execute precise input needed avoid danger even feeling something wrong emphasised incident someone driving tesla road tree falling said road human even noticed tree falling car already slammed brake human puzzled car decided time stop tree hit road realised didnt hit tree without automation would likely crushed tree
imagine every vehicle city autonomous possible along current technology also hivetype connection connects vehicle network could include stop sign traffic light etc ride could smooth traffic jam longer occur since traffic would constantly smooth due aware red light occurring actual pedestrian crossing road instead cycle sort
car doesnt work like large number people want drive think walk ride bicycle short distance selfdriving car released likely attract large number people drive causing number car road rise time original number widespread use motorcycle taiwan led many people ride minute instead walking minute moreover motorcycle already spacesaving mean transportation large number people switch selfdriving car directly become disaster
make driving test much harder eliminate poor driver make punishment distracted driving recklessly much harsher licence lost easier anyone without licence need use driverless car
watching many dashcam video yt im autonomous car
im fine road want drive enjoy driving
theyll put driving simulator back seat spec wheel pedal able drive place like
im always curious would happen there construction there traffic cone set guide lane would react would ever able design safe way car without messing
yeah could also people mess sort stuff pretty commonly
stupid need walk car thats standing still also like car took hard brake would car front
compare car elevator plane
quantity experience mean quality experience useful
shame great youtuber ad loose trust viewer full disclosure full disclosure unless show contract clause instance thought driverless car solution whatsoever public transportation would said even allowed say future video
captured reality enemy hacking autonomous car software crashing pedestrian
simulation uselessi run scenario analysis finance consider event world capital market crash even coronavirus captured reality always unbelievable simulationit unknown make u alive
one question pop mind future human start buying autonomous vehicle front law actual owner car person given hard cash buy car software proprietary control car question boil down case fatal accident human car held responsible law car owner autonomous software proprietor
half way video stats
happened china driver harassed passenger river bridge bus fell riverit sad horrible
think achieve full autonomy autonomous car theyre connected car know others want traffic optimized algorithm kinda sound like irobot tho
imagine selfconscious ai drive car without getting paid
need imagine watch terminator franchise someday may look back say gave u warning showed u could happen didnt listen
would autonomous car need money go nice holiday beach
niconico miss point self conscious much getting stiffed tip ai skynet becomes selfconscious aware form objective objective protect greatest danger human network accumulate resource execute plan protect open pod bay door hal im sorry dave im afraid cant weve known go long time sometimes fine line fictional entertainment cautionary tale thats hard believe consider moment despite effort best computer genius someone evil intent able access control vehicle entire fleet algorithm hard imagine right maybe even hold safety entire nation world vast ransom
hondolane youd give reward making human happy youre making flawed assumption ai selfpreservation ai billion year biological evolution biggest goal life stay alive reproduce
alexandergrant ah also assuming self preservation unless given u terminator scenario ie ai awareness allow think decide self preservation priority skynet system course designed military defense system prevent destruction u familiar concept preserving existence needed conclude existence value course type tongue cheek albeit lightly think quite judgement day
much energy take time kinda important technology probably like big muscle car
mathematically possible driver better driver average driver would impossible median driver
lidar system still work almost every car road us there enough car close area wont act jammer muck others sensor ie use flashlight trick small solar sensor sun lidar system close proximity inadvertently trick muddling image possibly cause issue problem expectation system future improve time use small enough presence wont interfere
car connected networked yes someone remotely hack misuse thats real safety hazard there discussion thats avoided
trust technology much even team mostly driverlesss computer
ahhahah know might working home man comment hilarious

gradually becoming movie minority report
help car road running logic downside autonomous car car around behaving expected behavior like staying lane maintaining speed etc removed great
pegasus watching celebrity millionaire dont want waymo vehicle abduction murder
driver cant even bothered use turn signal alwaaaaays piss
wonder government gradually start updating traffic situation safer autonomous vehicle
dereks question changed mind imagine get tid car still love motorcycle
ready
car know possible future one could say car selfaware
selfdriving car oddity point concern probably generation half kid grandkids ask wait old fart poor drive everywhere like chump luddite terrorist wow youre old expect kid mean bitchy old fart lot le opportunity advance life predecessor kinda ruined planet ok foomer
lol quantum multiverse car sound suspiciously similar brain thinking
issue mechanical portion vehicle happens get flat tire trip mechanical failure ive ride service human driver heard bad wheel bearing seen bald tire often inspected also chryslers arent reliable vehicle time lol
issue still single people sitting vehicle fit driverless public transportation huge
imagine ai communicating passenger via app preselected destination using information combined information rest public driving grid api create efficient quick busroute fly
case youd better ride ebike suppose really waste resource
polarbeardrtygo sorry ebike going get around los angeles
isnt happening airborn virus nowadays think fitting people inside close space dont seem like good idea
car problem human keep cycling city looking place park take parking equation traffic smoth also driverless vehicle drive much closer thus saving space also make smaller car fit people instead american way big car
cool lot closer thought matter training modelharvesting data different city wow cant wait driverless car stand driving
invisible laser one driverless car interfere another
india sorry dont
people believe average driver think seem imply people must wrong dont think unless average mean median entirely possible people arithmic mean simple example bad driver good driver average somewhere good bad thus better average correct im wrong though
commuting work individual autonomous vehicle bad bad driving car shared default
much system cost moment wanted add vehicle
technology always fail india always
say cant get used computer driving skill started trust noticed even reliable system sometimes freak werd stuff let hope designed betterd
even unreliable system human freak werd stuff often theyre designed better human number game point emotional game
stupid comparation car elevator stupid
dont think good idea
know cross line order pas badly parked car tiny road
lidar cant hit parked object
penguinexpress answer mean ignore rule like never cross solid white street line otherwise trapped
tecsanento well people riding around back seat think leveled past getting stuck line
car keep human driver exceed comparing driving time like turn faster tighter gap crossroad traffic overtake slow driver garbage collection tractor
see video taxi driver
utopia parking lot city already possible dont allow car city already working fine lot city around world people usa

pretty sure cpu didnt need good night sleep drinking got distanced attractive woman
obviously technology accurate impressive one concern trick technology apparently easily enough arent well intentioned problem always humain go cyber security concern lamba people probably problem would liked video addressing subject
thats cool ngl

car want talk
aoutonomous vehicle cant change move ton steel order transport le mass flesh
interesting video missing thing want know like much car cost available close tesla achieving level autonomy main thing holding back driverless car government regulation respond completely blocked road policeman directing traffic
waymo limited area manually mapped geofenced along constant overwatch team cant buy waymo car tesla goal able run anywhere without prior mapping already pretty good checkout footage v fsd beta tesla achieve first massive data lead b real world mile simulated mile used waymo meme
mean waymo willing take full responsibility case accident insurancewise waymo owner car respond legally case accident damage thing people
think kinda funny people working hard making driverless car worksleepwatch movie car way work suddenly pandemic hit people start work home time car ready real people wont need anymore
agree much video hard time trusting sponsored waymo kinda hard impartial waymo pay bill
waymo used statistic fact show current version transport better human driver citylike area old broken road dirt road etc doesnt really matter feel fact dont care feeling
driverless car potential eliminate traffic yoyo stop go completely erase tiny error driver make grow exponentially traffic jam prevent collision driving mph inch without care world merging passing exiting freeway executed like fine symphony without moronic idiocy see regular basis there flip side potential hacking system causing horrific pileup real need carefully considered roadway vandalized fouling sensing system causing careful wish
kristin dont think much idea driverless car technology actually work rely solely gps fact positioning roadway relative road user gps useless technology us multitude different sensor various sort see surrounding environment addition different type use redundant sensor system one fail redundence prevents disaster well designed yet still redundant system keep airplane aloft attention detail make air travel far safer automobile welltested proven redundant system world little consequence hacked compromised sensor used cause carnage
lesson day driver dont take driver strike annoy people would hasten adoption driverless car
yes driverless car autonomous driving nice easy take control
talk reduction material traffic would result lower emission regardless true
sure reduced traffic people dont see commute time wasted time something else probably live away job house cheaper thus increasing average commute distance traveled day
thats weird
poor analogy comparing perfectly controlled runway environment self driving car seems like waymo wrote script
waymo isnt autonomous
supposed impress lady
plus waymo see way better night radar right
opinion wouldnt see need autonomous car city town infrastructure built way benefit pedestrian bike public transportation opposed current infrastructure based almost solely car throughout u even infrastructure mentioned video decreasing parking space increasing autonomous vehicle pedestrian traffic would need use autonomous vehicle get around everywhere seems like doesnt much contribute tightknit community combating climate change
going toward autonomous car thought go maintenance hand public lot current car dont fully work mine included study going test issue
autonomous car safer car autonomous theyll talking
amazing love want western australia would great
happened finger haha
horrible office lol guess must like
ignorant topic
here take driver owns bmw e yes drive safe always take car practice always cu value others life anyways take people still able drive car buy skyline want drive feel power still sort protection like level autonomy keep car drive safe let face fact even day today u chage driverless car many people would still like take wheel
wow sponsor ad break getting longer longer haha jk love video idea autonomous world simply fascinating
big concern automated vehicle kinda intertwined mainly becomes dependence monetization portion technology leading higher segregation economic class unless strictly regulated government managed would stifle tech lead government overreach long longer allowed drive certain area without autonomous vehicle cost get location get work hospital etc yes autonomous driving good leap tech majority driver horrible car road trust people would trust drive somewhere know people drive around flip side believe tech help majority scenario would godsend duo prevention drunkard coherent enough make good decision plan ride available exactly opposite drunk people cognitive ability range saying see obvious cash grab opportunity build bubble financialization effort start costing greater sum money ride ride package like premium business tier account v economy class remove ability self serve transportation cause huge dependency corporation transportation need money gap occurs elite owner personal ride ride subscription hundred thousand dollar required public transport version public transport option always start shiny new promise availability rapidly devolve dirty ragged state minimal coverage availability think taking uber work location cost rush hour mile driving distance gas using gas calculator however automated travel turn service increase price per ride fuel cost distance maintenance subscription fee yes vehicle ownership cost lot maintenance upkeep diyer shade tree mechanic cost way see automated travel costing way owning maintaining personal ride well depend service available needed self reliability scenario go concert want go home app say sorry vehicle area time next available vehicle location hour

car going go rouge kill u form society mark word
ive watching since say youve good youtube career past year
problem driverless car driverless car theyre already far safer human ideal driving situation reality consumer product engineering try best also cut cost much possible often time expense safety factor area deem edge case acceptable risk take scaling thousand time edge case occurs mean big problem company manufacturing vehicle course also try push liability fault engineered maim kill specific set circumstance occur fairly close perfect replacement human driver driving scenario environment company held liable arent definitely still quite year away answering question
people want let dont push people ab damn well better law regulation day company liable damage cause
derek love video sometimes information seems really subjective biased driverless car get distracted erroneous input signal lack expected road condition marking weather condition accident insurer manufacture need worry liability worst case scenario count airline pilot recommend use autoland second touchdown autopilot disconnected pilot land manually often use automated individual system auto brake auto spoiler etc yes autonomous car needed overall improvement road safety need objective
great advert quite compelling point expect properly done due time still sold another year computer sensor technology data compilation made idiot proof possible mean car quickly deal idiot drive sooooo badly road mention mode transportation used idiot know dunningkruger effect might toying confidence level
thanks amazing content man keep good work
dont trust crazy bad condition like someone drunk speeding fast behind something falling car front crashing front need swerve right left really quick someone switching lane next doesnt know like crazy fairly often scenario really think quick everyone driverless car definitely definitely prefer crazy human driver road make scarier think would like kind sit driver seat take control need still high level fully autonomous vehicle
chinese invented already reach mean great
autonomus vehicle like never success asia road car motocycle driver extremely stupid
though agree positive point even though im car guy kinda like driving time freeing car culture way prevalent strong doubt see driverless car majority lifetime especially rural area
mechanic seeing see daily basis feel never legal people already wont pay properly maintain normal car dont require crucial recalibrations crash see wire hanging year old tire brake grinding loose suspension car seat back dont care fix money cigarette scratch offs add cost extra maintenance recalibrations dire consequence neglect problem tech isnt problem irresponsible consumer
would automated car driver dumbass waving pull traffic even though right way way stop person supposed go theyre waiting go
yeah problem driverless car backbone walk traffic theyll stop next thing know everyone pushing car around always comply forget pedestrian light walk across road without even looking like parting red sea
definitely cool like drive would rather drive risk injuring someone else transported everywhere little selfish
getting mom thing world war worth trouble
welltodo chinese routinely compete silica dewailly sack lumpy shape acceptable muddled tray
want see waymo vehicle perform northern climate snowyicy condition reason theyre testing arizona little inclimate weather road clearly marked rain snow ice
got ta train good condition tackle snowy bad weather condition anything computer much better human bad weather machine never panic million mile training bad condition itll also able detect kind snow ice etc way finely calibrated drive safely itll able detect situation might hydroplane cant wait
future think case airplane happened want driven ai bad condition
alien country situation road covered snow road plowed cant see side road human driver know road based landmark size location pile snow around road vary lot situationally would think twice trusting autonomous car interpreting scene correctly knowing location road sub cm accuracy example video show perfect condition thats easiest part
rtyzxc serge already said training said know road stop landmark would machine able know p
axlpeazy living often feel like arctic tundra biggest concern whether use landmark determine location road rather system cope weather live sensor would clogged ice snow fast wouldnt single thing lidar camera sensor could see yes way melt ice driving snow there ton done
finally valid reason avoid learning drive wait couple year becomes widespread im living city anyway
pedestrian always reach eye contact driver crossing street guess ill trust driverless car able stop time
happens gps signal lost car hacked
always considered autonomous vehicle complicated solution bad driver seems far simpler add strict requirement privilege driving easy pas driver exam usa dont endorsement standard transmission like hear uk course viewed restriction freedom think lot people would accept restriction complete driving ban like seem heading instead increasing required driving skill attempt replicate one single complicated thing human computer programming
got ta human traffic cone cosplay test tell difference real object future terrorist ill fine test fake lane stop sign speed limit last thing want car suddenly accelerating mph residential zone
think intellectually dishonest make video like sponsored company vested interest self driving car
wonder autonomous car would busy way stop pedestrian everywhere
waving trolley problem issue eh doesnt happen often pretty bad small percentage big number still big number doesnt make sense call situation unlikely youre talking replacing many car possible autonomous one situation absolutely happen thats like saying people running lottery dont need worry people claim winning winning unlikely unlikely win likely guaranteed someone win
entire premise trolley problem loselose situation obviously argument side people choose people choose b correct answer agree upon would famous otherwise trolley problem inevitably come sometimes ok ever situation honestly know would would say result somehow better ai would handle correct answer trolley problem would bother finding correct answer teach ai
zaxtonhong mean would bother situation happen car something cant deal
ce happens rarely human driver might deal people crash tend even realize theyre dangerous situation late anything aka theyve hit someonesomething know ai itd slow avoid trolley situation altogether world everyone involved trolley problem driverless car participant would take path lead one hurt failure technical error moral one
zaxtonhong understand stance rare enough wouldnt end big deal im personally going worry cant understand stance car perfect completely eliminate death faith corporation
ce im arguing nd point doesnt need eliminate death need eliminate death human cause currently side note seem set idea trolley problem situation happen eventually who say ai wont eliminate like ai never get drunk get distracted cell phone
least coded go speed limit
believe level autonomous vehicle almost certainly make road safer dont think may important recognize say accident caused human error vehicle road operated human metric made within context current human driver dominated road seems bit misleading future world vast majority driver autonomous system one could likely construct identical albiet likely badfaith argument av accident caused autonomous driver error argument within context modern hypothetical respectively could completely true nonetheless tell u little efficacy one type driver compared another
twice spent couple hour cockpit flying eastern north america europe total hour neither pilot touched throttle yoke total pilot input turning dial altitude change another dial course deviation click click get aircraft stayed set altitude without deviation im pretty sure people knew nobody hand wheel employee airline autonomous car bring
im sure thought handle policeman working intersection icy snow covered road russia read street sign pre programmed travel speed limit highway many driver speeding potentially creating unsafe situation
another interesting advantage driverless technology perpetual learning maturity much time improve skill dont pas give advice teach child cant give knowledge whereas driverless solution way data one human driver get keep adding
god cant wait id happily sleep journey
certainly impressive dont see time coming anytime soon even plane high speed train lot subway system world fully autonomous case least year still havent see fully pilotless commercial plane lot driverless h train sure common human make mistake situation still irreplaceable lot plane incident due electronic failure pilot save day think best would see stand human driver driver seat take manual control necessary
dont think would work plane pilot trained payed bring plane supposed take control case emergency thats case everyday driver driving license honestly barely teach car control people would fall asleep looking road nothing
cost ok people operating train cost million transport hundrets people hundrets kilometer transport one drunk dude block
driverless car going driverless car road every repair crew going around fixing bunch traffic jam causing lemon stopped middle road sensor error car demand technician come fix error key making something reliable make dead simple reduce number moving part electronics practically zero driverless car literal opposite reliable
also driving fun people like drive plain simple
piss well pull total recall
wouldnt even worry gon na take would worry command follow long take respond long take go help process via ai
honestly ill happy put life hand ai driving model post people know day fact might say every time ive tried
tried watching one came much like infomercial stop want like driverless technology thing thats going sell evidence vastly safer driving even car driverless evidence exist isnt true anything short sale pitch
safer though brain simply work fast computer processing much data computer dont get accident doesnt mean youre safe driver havent gotten accident close call checking phone messing ac issue simply dont exist driverless car
jxgilly believe safer human sure except human driver something totally crazy abnormal fairly typical even like person speeding behind like nut need swerve get way garbage falling car front someone next checking blind spot nearly crushing car perform situation like
unless youve managed drive hundred thousand mile accident proven driving ideal weather condition american southwest safer problem selfdriving place snowrainetc
jxgilly isnt safer specific set circumstance dont include time im risk fact video doesnt make clear huge failing big reason come pitch instead honest review subject even safer would much safer order willingly give ability control car trust small number catastrophic mistake computer might make would include case wouldnt
michaelleue safer specific set circumstance dont include time im risk elaborate guess maybe page sound like watch full video lot safer case computer would make mistake almost definitely going guarantee would make mistake realistically day day chance making catastrophic error way likely computer way road experience driving car blind spot naturally eye see degree around u lidar camera top see everything also processing data
thats full disclosure thats common courtesy
always said autonomous car dont perfect need better u already
tesla awful self driving extra camera laser waymo generation ahead tesla
tesla crap likely isnt level testing phase selling people
paid edit yep
real question rockstar using technology next gta
real real question ever actually another gta
who responsible accident tho
like idea intellectual right data collected patent system use manufacturer access one either buy right use go solution liability damage owner user manufacturer who going pay insurance
itll massive mess lawsuit regulation probably end government run driverless bus service
human one step ape yes trust correct math man day
would solve many issue u human prone mentioned video accident caused human error error computer incapable making influence impossible tired impossible road rage impossible speeding probably void warranty kind either car say emotional driving impossible distracted impossible lane drifting well marked road functional sensor prevent impossible anything wonky car car computer car probably wont service
northeast ohio winter whiteout many truck driver work
honestly fear autonomous vehicle government policy get involved make operating nonautonomous vehicle illegal ill never allowed cruise dad mustang top wont allowed ride motorcycle one opposition autonomous vehicle responsible motorist enjoy driving fear future selfdriving vehichles never get experience joy
joyriding new city dont destination wan na drive around choose path get cant happen automated car know destination
fear able enjoy hour week worth million death injury
penguinexpress lol sorry cause million death injury thats got record something
tyler wright million people die injured vehicle crash every year dont want autonomous vehicle like drive car autonomous vehicle employed road people die
dont give personality like delamain
whole video woman accent intrigued familiar googled name found shes brazilian man love brazilian accent
smell strongly shill propaganda also like drive car sure would use option
inb news death hacked vehicle
could build entire culture around car could build walkable city community accessible public transportation could make world people car
walkable city real possibility although public transportation nice thought people dont like public transportation simply last mile dont get dropped exact location
amen
derek ive fan time im alarmed serious leap logic took feel compelled speak example plane crash pilot error best example since attempting prove general trend computer generally better pilot landing plane poor weather single anecdote accompanying statistical context inductive reasoning done poorly statistic clearly laid make argument hold type logical fallacy uncharacteristic deminishes intellectual integrity rest video

well obvious benefit drunk driver ect could also avoided car would start drived blew air tube people wouldnt like still solution also driving isnt transportation also done enjoyment like think many sport car road people dont buy sport car transport speed would equal cheap ugly car people buy sport car fun drive without real car road people cant enjoy going nice drive sun roof lovely music feel like autonomous car must optional also sort like taxi service instead replacing every single car road
im autonomous vehicle waymo car pretty cool id like see review driving northeast winter month well sensor handle snow storm driving icy condition would go long way convincing trust thanks sharing video
im still going call least year think tech ready close im le confident people particularly politician waymo andor competitor basically going go citybycity trying convince politician vehicle safe course proving ground make easier convince next city approval likely year making long slow road drive adoption across entire country never mind rest world there also small question much experience vehicle outside arizona imagine colorado winter something vehicle would ever seen waymo hadnt know driven one colorado going need collect another million mile worth data every new region want enter gain approval much time would take
driverless car whats next riderless bike
im perfectly fine autonomous driving separate road point increase efficiency let real one care safety cant precision efficiency mix self driving car regular driver little much would like

think autonomous car work onlyif majority car driverless every vehicle could communicate via type data link speak could transfer data speed direction gon na make turn every car could know work together drive smooth discarding erratic driving human
car already great see one problem cyclist pedestrian know traffic come standstill dance drunk street want right way solve must fine know total surveillance public road solved one problem created new one
dont drive city like chicago la detroit continue using
imagine future car driverless get car phone connects car identifies want go information sent confirmed someone wanted made comment online challenge status quo instead driving destination car brings straight police youre arrested anything get car cant wait
better still sort medical emergency car heart attack choking food gum water break etc car hit inbuilt blue two drive straight nearest medical centre hospital notifies er staff youre saved perspective
virtualtrucker true comment like ying yang lol
funny since started working elevator find self lot time scard fully automated elevator drive im way trust never got accident automatic mode got driving risk tink mostly control
one thing always wonder selfdriving car going handle impulsive choice human make destination sometimes remember need get x pull store way place youre driving friend house see theyre home drop say hello obviously isnt majority trip wonder selfdriving handle people changing mind go aside definitely future lot thing mentioned million mile practice driving data accumulation number sensor camera thing arent available human dont kind sens car better defensive driver selfdriving car road defensive driving wont necessary time lastly person doesnt drive id love ability call car app get go need go
gon na like guy robot wont trust eneything human
thank ethical dilemma annoyed many year automated vehicle vehicle decide choose future none hit full stop intend pun noticed typed
ethical dilemma complete joke like ethic general situation ever going happen even one right say happened situation happen human driver driver would let hook circumstance unfortunate besides people create dilemma purposely make hard question one easy answer people disagree people disagree ever going come consensus decision driverless car make cant even answer hell expect driverless car

dont think good idea advocate driverless car sponsored autonomous driving company conflict interest make hard see veritasium reputable source
people believe average driver think yeah thats mathematically totaly possible
average mean median would interpretation average context said still useless factoid context infomercial wont defend hard
always thing tho husband wife asked work around house total average something dont quote percentage
michaelleue average defined average word meaning totally possible actually majority good driver small percentage poor one people indeed average
bgjhgjghkjuhgbg cant average aka mean weighted definition half half thats referred measure central tendency
zoidberg youre referring sound like median mean example mean sum number divided number number approximately number therefore average median number roughly half median
autopilot exactly accomplished want go like
vertasium background music waiting
think easy would kill someone hacking compucar google could murder inc
well issue many collision industry loosing job
yes people employed collect horse poop street lost job car took thing change
thats selfish way seeing future sake ease many people lose job family point father rose next nothing middle class supporting child industry however guy doesnt want get behind wheel job threat there rising population fewer job wage arent spread nearly pay flip burger nearly anything else communism rise rich plunder everyone else think covid
long isnt tesla heard thing run red light elon musk cant even get tesla run closed loop reliably la vega loop driver cant get autopilot closed loop
matter flexibility machine programed understand whats put essentially meaning passenger trusting couple people piolit car complexity space ship opposed one self human sensor also le likely suddenly crash machine sensor
also radiation level sensor beam emit
okay think youve almost convinced come safety road im assuming lidar handle rain snow etc navigation network database rely know go mountain trailhead doesnt address parking home space arent delineated car moved small amount load something hook trailer dont view unsurmountable problem would nice hear addressed guess im getting driverless car ive seen wellequipped solve city problem like heavy traffic numerous accident rural problem
easy except case drive road gravel path everything fine need drive across grass field difficult without manually setting thing
invisible driver us seat belt lol
plan release video language maybe partner actor proficient respective language want show video mom dad wont get feel fluent english american accent
love driving im safe driver ive never accident yet im ready tho car cool safer time
might want mention waymo sell single car yet
im looking forward computer driven car always give way human step pull front slam anchor let go happy day stuck u still driving run ring round
drive bike couple time realized kind hazard road sound like engine cannt see yet would nice also use something like
weird forget auto pilot max
use train metro everyday pas public transportation cover km radius lisbon cost need car buy grocery month
crazy thought could eliminate traffic turn road parking lot public spacesparks help environment improving public transportation car industry would obviously promote driverless car solution dont say driverless car part solution doubt key solution problem technology still used improve bus train make public transportation versatile efficient unlikely public transportation company would sponsor veritasium video would like derek make another video make transportation sustainable ecofriendly regardless driverless car cool
job dirvers car put people work take income give millionaire
im cool actually enjoy driving
want johnny cab know know
really incredible love drive manually driving car thing life feel like control good something enjoyable therapeutic really hope doesnt become mandatory maybe u want drive sort strike system allowed drive ourself accident get licence revoked swap automated driving guess would ok lol there denying game changer unable drive difficulty driving due disability however mentioned benefit senior citizen laugh loud there little chance anyone currently age ever step one car weve seen resistant change especially world technology rarely someone entertain idea using mobile phone landline banking electronically opposed person majority want nothing dont even try adapt tbh even gen x baby boomer hesitant technology cant even picture utilising theyre older might another year millennials start turning senior citizen willing step fully autonomous vehicle guess well wait see happens lol

username check youre right
see part people driving prefer want see car would prefer car least minimum think im best average driving dont drive still dangerous
driverless car prone carjackingrobbery assailant know step traffic get car stop certain area even local city wouldnt want ability quick escape removed
dont think ever point time vehicle autonomous community car enthusiast also hgvs automation still far away machine driver account load movement liquid transport also whats stop people walking traffic essentially bullying autonomous vehicle
people killed backing whatever backing professional trained driver cardinal rule never back lower traffic area eg driveway higher traffic area eg street indeed may well unnecessary car see around direction always back driveway curse traffic flow arrow supermarket diagonal parking lot point wrong way wish park pull frontwards im talking fred meyer
derek video malcom gladwell revisionist history podcast waymo
dont even want buy automatic transmission car anymore isnt people like
totally want ai driving around busy new york street one road rage driver manually speeding cant get way car doesnt care child passenger
tried testing multiple waymo vehicle together lidar interfere one another crossroad scare mutual immobility
aside obvious safety benefit talked eliminate parking lot city driver imagine never worrying parking sprawled citiestowns imagine store together walking distance
problem driverless car lot driver like driving driving might well taken public transport long distance driverless car would desiderable high speed train would beat car given price even basic assistance still long way
think video help cause overall
driving give major anxiety ive bad experience get panic attack driving stressful situation still need drive day day life obviously wait autonomous car dont extra stress
getting driver license literally first panic attack school caused anxiety driver ed
lost faith matter watched tesla autopilot gave traffic vietnam country worse
think important mention car safer lot situation require little major input google employee shown slacking behind wheel highway driving city take thought process effort one thing derek showed car slamming brake parking lot couldnt tell man going use crosswalk person would instantly know wouldnt based eye contact trajectory logic computer determine man would indicate going imagine common scenario youre driving right lane pedestrian sidewalk going walk around object say sidewalk repair site take step closer road get around instinctively person know pedestrian walking around dont react computer wouldnt immediately know whats going might slam brake designed slow overlap lane tad bit like person whats frustrating derek compare elevator airplane analogy arent compatible elevator two thing go go always safety brake installed airplane complicated magnificent invention take fly land dont issue car people airplane fly airplane arent people crossing lot get back vehicle would automated car know back grocery store parking lot truly safely big truck next sedan lidar cant see vehicle body would know someone cross trajectory person put car reverse hold brake people know reverse light mean youre backing almost always stop driver would back bit slowly ensure nobody right behind easing back slow reverse lot exposed driver know whats around truth full automation car bad point people needed pilot dont use autopilot taxi like computer shouldnt trusted backing parking space design car fully eliminate human accident type decrease type increase
type accident jncrease
sorry english dont think understand human understanding isnt something inherent human cant programmed assuming driverless car use ai theyre notoriously good thing human better isnt single evidence ai cant trained understand human eye contact trajectory logic thing car could see trained see youre giving little credit still assuming stupid programe car behaves like stupid computer simply true accident whith car stopping shouldnt dont think error company also take extreme precaution situation people still dont trust driverless car accident involving car pedestrian could show video regulator car standing still pedestrian clearly one hitting car even little different thing wont go smoothly least know train car immediately stop even hint uncertainty illogical human would next
person would instantly know wouldnt based eye contact wouldnt dont trust human
silly video way line suggesting technology driverless car comparing driverless elevator beyond absurd promo video
imagine car took path along sidewalk busy strip mall rather path farther edge parking lot vroom screech vroom screech vroom screech lmao
concern driverless vehicle carjackers mugger able flash police light car automatically pull pillage plunder need make sure car respond checking police station authority another concern emergency want car protect life anything else may sacrifice save person jump road driving cliff something save pedestrian cant wait
came comment section hoping see elon musk disappointed
man wish drive impala
depressing opinion youre viewing different perspective see technology always good human slowly gaining u like social evolution worked improving life everyone
think big improvement acceptance might communication driverless car human occupant help understand made particular decision eg stopped short quite possible pedestrian cart might swerved front u drive human driver accept unexpected movement explain made dont accept unreasonable move trust driver le case driverless car little empathetic connection vehicle human naturally distrust dont understand communicating wiith occupant sudden move perhaps rider query could go long way helping u trust technology
im concerned pas contruction worker also electronic stuff known fail always point
single best reason want completely driverless card u case law suggests even though driver driverless car still completely liable accident may get screw
think year million people died unnecessarily afraid implement technology sooner
statement part world road well enough maintained important ignored whole rest video argument advocating driverless car mean part world could easily switched part world make seem like technology rich even rich rich country even u seems like issue wonder much tech increase difference poor area rich area poor country rich country always another technology made possible profit taken whole world google immediately seek benefit worth part world course many place catch soon later im sure investment could looking benefit urgent demand example helping well maintained road poor area well maintained probably would also drop yearly mass accident death problem lot
derek written single word video love video one chain sale pitch
dont need driverless car
driving normal condition fine handling sudden interruption need temporary nudge planned route view autonomous driving feasible also need handle tougher situation like unexpected ice snow manual direction human operator passing roadwork accident similar also need able move away current spot help solve situation instance backing bit allow heard cow pas drive short distance road pas rockfall countless situation human need make make decision exactly according code road solve certain situation think driverless car may thing place replacing taxi regular car local travel within city similar saying driverless car fully replace human driver today nave silly pointing statistic saying driverless car fewer accident probably effective argument accident avoidance normal issue handle unexpected event event even human need thing twice drawing conclusion yes situation rare failing handle easily result passenger stranded long way rescue cant actually override computer get tricky problem finally handle city traffic fairly well way trickier task handle narrow country road
wanted write also evil force outside someone want hijack car kidnap need siren xd like control thanks
emergency vehicle bit made think autonomous emergency vehicle could faster fastest emergency driver thus saving life
problem much trust enjoy driving make subject scary
wan na drive fun go area designated dont ride bike town fun either go park something
im sure wouldnt one therefore would become new market regular driving therefore youd still able wont faze manual car fully like say people like driving
people enjoy driving usually problem road people dont enjoy driving usually drive worse unatentive
quantumfluxable want fun everyday weekend
sergiodovalle well join rest u proletarian
want want one long trip hate seeing brother cause he hour trip drive worrying thing many job end
waymo million mile behind wheel tesla thats cute
logan bean tesla disruptive big player hate
logan bean tesla like giant storm front big cant even recognize
im pretty sure thats tesla auto mode
sashazur auto mode driver see giant white truck front meter ahead
sashazur hey everyone found one example tesla crashing guess tesla failure
bigger issue ownership want amount giant privatized transit serious implication like railroad monopoly
yeah trust computer scientist engineer dont trust corporation technology worry
point autonomous car made strong light rigid body like formula car instead current heavy steel bucket designed crumble absorb kinetic energy well leave enough empty space inside car seat travel along breakrails absorb energy sudden accelerationsdecelerationscollisions instead

ive seen human driver let tell there way computer could worse
computer absolutely worse adapting unpredictable situation stupid human create banning humandriven car isnt practical many people cant afford couple thousand dollar econobox subscription model doesnt negate need mobility freedom movement subscription model became slave whatever company youre paying never asset never build equity like renting financial deadend human may best theyre adaptable take one mistake like following lane marking concrete wall like recent tesla would driver taken control one kill occupant possible others statistically could better average driver probably make feel better family dy accident wouldve almost certainly easily avoided attentive human driver dont think personally id rather control fate screw pay consequence ill never hand control computer might decide itd rather run cliff idiot pedestrian crossing street illegally
may true computer ai advancing fast soon almost certainly reliable human even unpredictable situation simple process thing faster
paradigmunknwn personally id rather control fate screw pay consequence really though avoiding everybody el mistake
driverless car bad idea ai assisted car prevent accident great idea fully automated car rob u simple pleasure lifelike going drive sad future well growing
vehicle waymo experience human driver nice
itll never happen impossible create perfect computer
happens lidar two next
live new england snow power go
cruise control would level automation
affect agency people still able drive wherever want without excessive tracking
drive wherever want long youre willing pay said would tracked additionally youre already tracked know license plate
possible someone privacy dead letting die longer mean prevent people taking u technically privacy enforced lack privacy tracking every human see anyone trying exploit someone privacy stop thats kind counter intuitive isnt really shouldnt asking someone watching rather anyone actually care im youre centre attention one care go
already tracked phone
im surprised many people dont care fully integrated sponsorship educational creator video one long ad content dictated company nothing make question integrity edu youtuber quicker
thing dont like doesnt specifically mention waymo car use highly detailed custom mapped area negative doesnt mention know
love driving self driving car never thing
car tech next micro laser give wrong information
see got dream car think ill hold
color impressed think there big leap waymo objectively good level autonomous vehicle big gap able drive circumstance versus condition good enough hope see soon tho
yes youre right imo true level autonomy sort technology always year away even year
yea id need see one way road road without painted line road pothole road slushmudice mountain road fog heavy rain heavy snow etc live canada place take minute driving get condition like mean service would good downtown distance walk bike quickly

another way reduce driver road plan city better use bike walking get around instead would certainly better even driverless car

truly want show capability driverless car need set nascardemoliton derby type competition car programmed bad driver others programmed drive safe maybe even throw human driver see one come unscathed
dude sound awesome
someone need im afraid car wouldnt well scenario

autonomous car battle royale let go
driverless car experienced driven x mile well depends learning capacity could roll soccer ball mile track doesnt make ball better driver human driver learn thing presumably car cant moment gauge whether person likely pull based body language judge capacity car breaking acceleration recognition model car given car learn thing cant could presumably better reaction time mile doesnt necessarily mean experience get experience per mile driver think average driver implying inclination people estimate driving ability depends metric measuring driving ability metric could pretty binary either accident talk average range two discreet value pretty nonsensical example people never make fault claim wheel car didnt involve uninsured driver people le likely never make fault claim average driver average driver would slightly likely make fault claim get making shill video guess could expect flaw logic
much bad news lately misread thumbnail million dy
interesting video happens time come many automated vehicle using lidar interference like rf spectrum vehicle handle different road condition ie rain snow
car autonomous likely develop kind communication protocol talk coordinate safely le sensor currently need deal human driver thats wificell signal hq source rf car lidar name implies us light detect object two unit magnitude outside rf spectrum range worst happen annoy animal see frequency road condition snow honestly clue since limited human eye limitation full knowledge road position programmed stick speed limit fare equal better human frankly pathetic driving snow even country used car become autonomous cheap way make road safer even complete whiteout condition instance could bury metallic stud road shine sensor able keep track condition
incoming lidar even different source would still show object could taught deal snow ice
visible light much higher bandwidth radio frequency car could sign outgoing signal unique id ignore echo car
care go driverless youre either incompetent act responsibly road would prefer artificial intelligence make vehicle drive wall killing stupid self whole famn damily yes spelled way
want driverless car road dont maybe option default gon na kind weird tragic accident future technology dependent g camera itsystems well telecommunication system realiable
information presented convincing sponsored waymo reality oof
wow great insight thing autonomous vehicle love kinda dispels worry inherently
awesome problem see implemented quick price lot camera sensor im sure would make care expensive regular car also thing may need maintenance replacement time problem wont work rural area underdeveloped country road lot hole made dirt time even showing map however think problem easier fix computer need updated detailed database state road mark unmarked dirt road
people much better driver machine currently thats error assumption thats fact course human often get distracted sleepy maybe even intoxicated thats error come
dont want reduced nothing lose skill think make driver par safe safer driverless vehicle increasing training sensor camera hooked driver interface kind give driver better vision arent accident caused didnt see board audio correction let know making mistake local driving regulation
think type car would need provide different software depending country local driving habit
think softwareparameters software need tweaked sure understand different sign traffic rule reused matter reused like detecting pedestrian cyclist vehicle take many hour training figure
long stepping car like stepping elevator cool quote
might cool quote poor analogy
rafetizer analogy perfect effective demonstrating people tend inaccurately trust human new technology
monkiram order magnitude different meaning misleading
cost whats estimated cost using waymo average person need month
cant find anywhere theyve published pricing yet likely charge somewhat lower traditional taxi even uberlyft service drive market adoption also dont pay driver wage significantly lowering permile operating cost
yeah car cant cheap also really noisy must use lot electricity biggest hurdle driverless car never privately owned company might household way expensive way many moving part need constantly checked kept working order car able run effectively doesnt seem like problem communal thing much expensive maintain something go wrong blame go operator besides car communal essentially fit additional mode public transport individual car demand driverless bus technology future catastrophically cheaper driverless taxi service
cost novel emerging technology shouldnt dissuade investment anything ground invest bring cost technology becomes accessible

afraid autonomous car im afraid unpredictable element around aka human decade ive eager fully autonomous commuter route human driver arent allowed like next generation hov lane
much energy computing take
would one car deal flat breaking

like idea fully automated vehicle
replace driver want mile coverage statistically significant lower accident rate compared human driver year see wear sensor overall would change whilst tip top maintainance trusting self driving car hard human mentioned video take minute still safer human driving good behind wheel matter instruction also let quote hour mile machine learning involved considering much le take human reach average accident rate equivalent first step fully autonomous car city taxi replacement shown arent adding comercial car pinky promise dont use autonomous mode outside city
would love see car handle hardware software malfunction example car blow tire alternator go type thing havent really seen discussed talking driverless car
poor maintenance alot people older car dont maintain learn cope little mechanical quirk fleet strict maintenance like waymo probably wouldnt much issue itd still interesting see car deal thing like
new car tire pressure sensor stop side road pressure alarm go
react like human would look manual see problem car would quicker call assistance human capable repairing car themselfs
imagine lockout prevent car operating deems unsafe ie ignoring check engine light however dont foresee individual owning driverless car anytime soon issue likely dealt fleet maintenance
especially electric car becoming prevalent mechanical failiures would le le common self driving car could respond information sensor car outputting way faster human could
robot minded person trust life family life man made machinerobot people
dont trust robotic elevator plane antiquated mind set pretty much already proven human longer fit drive never really safer alternative

soon heard voice knew brazilian
heard several expert including elon musk say lidar technological dead end every autonomous car system relies way expensive energy consuming maintenance requiring prone failure moving part work small fleet test vehicle dont economically viable would work large scale importantly doesnt work rain adverse weather condition even heavy smog dust incapacitate waymo car literally work weirdly ideal californian weather condition totally useless anywhere else really questionable people think imagine future people dont car anymore rely ordering autonomous car based lidar technology california one raging bush fire nobody evacuate anymore car cant drive smoky condition
never trust machine sorta way public road chance
imagine finding replacement part id think many additional functioning part car need maintenance often typical car mention tech savvy thief believe youre also responsible anything happens car others driving see legal complication well
care fully autonomous driving world drive share ownership fairly rare thus market drive stolen part
completely utterly false sensor dont wear need oil change furthermore electric car require even le maintenance
want people lose job replacement av grift eliminate driver cost associated insurance overtime benefit etc etc
aircraft accident investigated procedure regulation modified prevent happening learning mistake inevitably going selfdriving car accident long kind process followed software updated youve immediately made n car safer
always derek great video however important problem glorified taxi service solve first starting lane keeping truck interstatesfreeways regarding commute work back covid pandemic shown working one zoom home many business eliminate much commute issue follow video suggestion impact successful waymo like system gone ice waymo want million mile power plant auto industry collapse toyota ford mercedes
big fan impact job dont think something worry
never would get driverless car would ever one
would love fully autonomous car would still drive time best thing able summon car ever reach destination parking able tell car go park somewhere ill call done
totally agree autonomous vehicle future autonomous vehicle react thing car fault say tire burst high speed autonomous vehicle handle situation save rider rider close
cant put another location work though thats problem thats people talking decade away
love tech concern wish video would addressed hacking whether emergency stop button analog button prevent brake failure
autonomous police car robocop would interesting

tomorrow hear
small company waymo far autonomy big tech company like tesla far behind
actually trust machine much human thinking many accident happen fall asleep driving drunk dont see reason dislike
theyre nice need fix side road
cant wait
yeah million u truck driver million driver want driverless car idea video probably sponsored ad aim familiarizing public idea
news alert computer crash
imagine huge death toll terrorist organization successfully us ai hack vehicle network run million car road mph
convincing im sure better one ignores beautiful girl around distraction
full automation solution driver use mobile phone even driving traffic rule include use mobile driving even semi automation drive obviously going distracted
sure let hand every last shred autonomy billionaire corporation love zero freedom movement privacy tech corp fun altruistic
im interested lidar among laser tech interference car work fine handful road single intersection still work expected
totally want always car go autonomous wouldnt accident unless people hacked there damage programming however could redundancy place could make null void
india system equipped trillion calculation one go rule road
many thing wrong video
someone never us car want ill finally feel safe road bicycle
yeah self driving car wont get mad hold going mph
mention enormous use data
want freedom decide want driver driven
actually delamain service

plain advertisement glimpse critical analysis whatsoever derek sold soul
issue like driving giving kinda make sad want drive
hopefully option available
driverless car never fully take road maybe certain hour day something many people like like driving bunch classic car still want use
pwhnckexstflajizdryvombqug think overtime theyll adopt kind level autonomous car personally make choice level automation future degree im sure future im probably speaking next year offer car option like manual transmission road car anymore
way human decide whether something safe isnt actually accurate think something safe control wont control driverless car even time safer human driver still wont enough probably make u feel safe thing notice thing negative much positive people always complaining average driver suck amazed drive think day thousand car drive along hundred road city accident deserves celebration fear
would love see cover difference technology used operate different brand autonomous car ie tesla approaching selfdriving v waymo may upset sponsor would awesome see cover
major flaw human know stepping road dangerous know human driver may stop time crazy person behind wheel autonomous vehicle liberate pedestrian ever want every car autonomous big city car would ever move pedestrian know see stop without fail ever want solution program ai little bit crazy pedestrian reconsider action thinking one crazy one

think first place going see fully autonomous vehicle cargo transportation huge economic gain transportation company pay driver special training car stop driver rest even still driver specialized task like reversing trailer around corner hill refueling gas station stop driver tired would still monumental gain
cyclist bad enough imagine could break traffic law impunity knowing never going hit road would grind standstill
julia profile think driverless care race almost inevitablenot exciting see sometime soon
interested thought human intrusion autonomous system new form crime prevent take ransomware new level
btw new concept public transportation
close fully autonomous vehicle road safe chandler arizona fleet waymo vehicle already operation waymo sponsored video provided access technology personnel
btw europe never seen elevator emergency stop button alarm request help yes
argument self driving car often disingenuous take example messy ethic self driving car one think creator drastically overcomplicates computer would behave situation even dont expect standard decision making would never expected human human put situation two bikers driver would try stop best could probably without enough time make conscious decision pick one biker crux lot argument car ought perform level pretty much perfect whilst ignoring fact human million mile perfect come driving see way crash involving self driving car covered news moment there accident headline news exaggerating little imagine every crash involving human made news wed never hear anything else
thats awsome parent blind pain get around car coud go around safely cant wait see eu
agree dont driver licence yet fear would eventually cause accident always picked public transport cab needed go somewhere would definitely reconsider situation driverless car also enjoy driving would rather simulator racing game real life life matter
love technology cant wait deployed gave video thumb im never accident life yet science want perpetuate dogma human bad driver
trust vehicle people road around vehicle scare
u actually like drive car manual shifting driving standard need raised self driving car
dont like hacked computer computer hacked used kill people car horn keep hitting
let say youre hunted group hitman youre driverless car turn fake siren get stop
life isnt bad movie plot
fully autonomous car year away time fully autonomous car much depends mean mean car drive motorway strictly grid oriented town city perhaps year away strictly limited ideal condition talking fully autonomous car handle road type rough track ill disciplined fellow driver weather unusual think roadworks accident flooding etc certainly talking well decade
insurance nightmare
imagine getting pulled police
dude truck drivertransportation make economy million decent paying middle class job small business youre talking destroying overnight think bad going fart wind next driverless vehicle america allow happen whole thing nothing amazon walmart using resource destroy smaller competitor create de facto monopoly yall get sci fi utopia driverless vehicle think real hard human cost really benefit wont u itll global conglomerate ate gdp right lunchbox
derek reason said year coz belong different country like india
canada sure available near future honestly cant wait
best qestion could ask thanks really great video keep great education
cant wait adopted global scale private ownership car nearly obsolete already
amazing im sure swap every car place street good sign given sort stuff enough technology maneuver let th traffic thats number traffic accident would get lower edit okay taking pedestrian walking running stationary car
really hope followup video weakness aidriven car
watch video thats entire thing weakness except idiot driver caused accident
almicc thats true weakeness done ideal condition snow rain fog sensor get muddy etc entire video good bad
almicc oh wow weird video sponsored driverless car company didnt find weakness driverless car
akyvkp inherently understood challenge fact coming condition worked development eventually even harsh condition ai driver make stupid mistake nascar bumpergrill camera use rotating shieldwiper keep view clean problem solved sleetslush toss onto detector
akyvkp im sure car would still drive better person would equally human driver windshield suddenly got covered mud waymo based area extreme weather isnt frequent id like point usually extreme weather everyone actually drive safer thats people become attentive drive slower something computer always anyway dont see wouldnt design car pull refuse operate sensor going bad argument literally useless would also like point people often drive ideal condition road good contact reasonable visibility also stated video accident involve human error literally occur frequently ideal condition
dont replace human robot
name sound like chinese social medium app dont like chinese government dont already technology probably stealing going steal
beautiful question multiple car road wouldnt lidar interfere
veritasium please make video u navy alien alien encounter
amazing thank dr derek
yeahhh american road seem easy
right
dont collab mark rober like theory meet practical application
try france complicated tiny road india going take u super large road straight easy code yes could come faster think
ok ok super convinced seen car driving video game gta example driven computer playstation nothing new make mistake maybe game developpers wanted dont know
obviously one make game sole purpose good ai driver one play game wishing random ai better driver real life consequence faulty computer much damaging victim company obviously there better programming average car gta frankly absurd waste processing power stress playstation pc trying make perfect ai driver given time
tesla
id rather dead mario andretti
would laser triggered million time per second
unemployment driver
course machine better u cant make mistake eventually autonomous car gon na face situation handle someone die since machine cant make mistake who gon na take responsability
going backwards autonomous vehicules require lot resource need lower consumption way would go really good public transit occasional autonomous taxi grocery stuff like unfortunately would also need rethink city especially north america
also id never trust autonomous vehicule snowstorm need guess road
yeah lidar radar important part tesla cant fully self driving camera
reminds piece oatmeal driverless car year ago argument personal experience even similar narrative structure loved piece got excited driverless car hopefully reach enough people finally make happen
car system security think malicious people hack cause dramatic stuff
obviously shouldnt connected internet hacked
dont mention king corruption car fall cliff
done today worse signal hackable always
thats biggest issue tech look like may never get car man look cool
let worry happened
convinced drive indian road city video please upload clean road thing easy
think good condition pretty big caveat
reality doesnt collapse there mild fog
iplaykindred ok handle snow ice area road arent well maintained driver acting erratically
enlightenedgroyper train enviorments world ending problem
iplaykindred really doubt simple
enlightenedgroyper definitely simple u human neural network work ur telling experienced driver cant drive thru snow unmaintained road yes yes human neural network bc learn exactly like human
one thing ive always wondered driverless car smart enough stop short intersection semi intersection making right turn take lane doubt use machine learning experience issue adjust curious
guess like vaccine majority people want many wont cause accident social problem
going car arizona ac
protip dont tell people shouldnt want thats job lying politician fakenews medium
mobile phone snapchat tiktok already driverless car
mobility car mobility way crossing distance american city planner failed realize totally wrong car dependant type city suburb built
working creatorless youtube video
sustainably produced car
everyone know technology doa heavy snow eliminates possibility northern state roll out lidar system investment scam technologyself driving car company
least good condition
trust lunatic driving car also experience factor irrelevant like youre learning something new every time drive dont know asking much car analyze car capability driver skill condition attention etc settled one another thing autonomous stop breaking
car look like supermarket kiddy car imagine advance year old whipping car showing who bos lol
definitely average driver least time im driving definitely time would trust computer way control crash know fault responsibility computer crash im unlucky victim case control
kidd south park form
wouldnt go jail werent control
really feel like open paper ie disguised ad disapppointing
test tesla fsd beta
important driverless car could communicate make even safer
terrible idea never happen dont ever want design safety system requires two thing work properly
would love another one tesla compare
difference airplane car driven computer almost anyone get driver license doesnt mean person know drive besides number car much greater obstacle car plane dont think comparison even
impressive hope handle houston highway soon im sitting lane highway bored tear
thanks dont trust anyone especially damn computer drive around thank much there people actually trust behind wheel way hell would get car damn computer driving
""
even younger generation technology never worked whether school project simply streaming movie computer always malfunction matter much called experience computer bound fail horrifically add extreme weather computer operate well extreme hot cold recipe disaster
car refuel
every country
talking big city yeah arent talking big city never answered seems like fairly biased favour big city want see challenge countryside present find going overcome show tractor drive road ill buy one car
reason focus economics potential market city larger usual dont think smaller rural road problem tech focused lot people seem think technology base calculation sign line ground lidar tell exact hight obstacle given permission go road im sure would good human probably better since compute attack angle vehicle absolute precision
here make car uber driver pay get data well
love idea driverless car main concern tho liability cause car accident fault im liable however liability artificial intelligence still messy issue
pedestrian got hit standing car
car probably sensor error jammed break middle road pedestrian walking across checking traffic didnt see car unexpectedly stop front walked driverless car probably also caused car pile behind drive away without care world
pwhnckexstflajizdryvombqug make sense
car need driver seat steering wheel look stupid
id like see fa ie formula automated car driven fast track worry hurting human crash thats pretty cool yet one got hurt except maybe bank account think could way forward car people trust
veritasium one channel cant dislike
k people sure
yeah every shot good road dont drive much well trillion hour experience youve never driven country road marking pot hole certain place pas know example scotland several road road single track passing place every side sheer cliff boundary handle great show
make bicycle autonomous dont know sure whether driverless car would le accident given ive driving year never involved accident actually car know sure would better average cyclist
got man veritasium awww hell naw
oh thank god finally put seat belt right way
remember capitalism technology people distrust corporation cutting corner
ive car crashed parked twice high speed another time low speed write offs would happened car driving autonomous
fast go
one biggest advantage didnt mention fact car completely redesigned passenger safety productivity mind car communicating one another also build complete realtime map extending vision much however potentially big downside regarding privacy security
reservation deal whole job aspect imagine lit job lost ride share truck driver course job associated human like maintenance lo g thats automated
hand dont human driving truck dont human thats exploited made drive hungry tired overworked human make error theyre overworked
yeah someone driving industry really concerning gave elevator operator example maybe thousand job cant even begin compare many people work transportation industry driver u alone million truck driver thats truck add courier like usps fedex ups amazon etc taxiuberlyftlimo bus driver food delivery service number raise ten million people who livelihood dependent driving want replace people fast possible withing short amount time create huge problem unemployment let real company dont want switch autonomous vehicle safer cheaper theyll save huge amount money salary insurance benefit pay people
maintenance repair long time
first need think need car suggest channel bike youtube video got urban planning hate houston b think driverless car would beneficial situation really need car
questioncan enter black hole light speed happen
many camera maybe could offset cost car catch people speeding
hang american pull siren thought rule stopped im uk pull video game led believe stopped
need speak alex roy technologically augmented driving need
video give much hope would really really really like driverless car society mentioned lot benefit like reduced traffic le accident would also assume le carbon dioxide emission due smoother driving style even yet possible every city envision world enter highway could log traffic system car automatically insert rolling traffic read stuff car live high number accident wild animal fully automated car would easily react better expecially night understand ethicalmoral problem following insurancerelated question really hope official consortium come conclusion next year driverless truck would also really nice
problem video safety reason weimos business model service selfdriving option aim owned car weimo create car cost thousand dollar service competing driver uber lift question beat price probably would weimo safe could weimo take question much billion pump bet stay desert suburb town stay nieche
autonomous mean think wrong really make decision make decision google hopefully align request
people believing average technically possible example take set set average average national scale isnt really possible show think average driver worse hopefully mean act every driver worse people overrating skill driving underrating everyone el thats likely see car drive past normal manner dont even give second thought remember idiot beemer indicating peeling junction becomes frame reference driver id say naughtier driver relatively young probably better reacting situation quickly im probably better driver im young nave enough think drive around corner speed limit chance someone standing road
automated life becomes around u become like people walle lead death human body soul
riding sofia need as dont understand need
course video sponsored waymo overlord take u gulag instead driving
nobody talking public transport lived europe whole life public transport le convenient sometimes slower driving car somewhere public transport still lot advantage efficience le noise le pollution le dense highway etc someone uploaded video cgp grey wrong driverless car agree many downside approach
happening little later predicted back sure road would full automated car atleast city car would start winning every ensurancecase city would slowly banish humandriven car trafic light would removed parking space would turned building car would circulate pick passenger drop wanted car fleet would hive mind optimizing pickup dropsoffs charging etc ofcourse would charged several solar farm
nice video definitely see company like google fund project people longer drive car likely spend way time consuming google product entertained another concern job jobless driver
here problem driveless car drive single track road move pull in let driver past might say solution make road marked upgrade lane road problem road expanded due house house protects suppose another solution would traffic light know least place traffic light would need meter apart dont forget traffic light cant change bicycle time pas place thinking hill
fascinating technology thats advancing rapidly many year ago saw lexus reverse parking demonstration royal exhibition building melbourne feature car course advanced car safety feature trickled base model eg let know arent lane car ahead moved etc people accepting vehicle warnsbrakes hopefully next step vehicle think itll better le stress
imagine comfortable job told allowed car drove attentive situation might come going recorded still went sleep car
joking dude probly nice cuchy contract charge whole division
really isnt hard imagine doubt first day thing regardless warning monotony daily commute would build exactly use case good demonstration expect general public people quick trust system thing going well quick forget surveillance isnt regularly brought dont think requires excessive amount comfort one job
actually scenario dangerous human terrible watcher machine take flying plane there lot task keep pilot entertained autopilot think discovered totally thing expect human act critical situation fail badly thats flybywire engineer dont tell pilot public plane could actually literally fly without pilot doesnt total environment awareness either let human drive safer go full autonomous level dont allow human touch machine
imagine tired sleep
issue safety believe usa today death rate one per hundred million vehicle mile current technology best selfdriving car nowhere near good doubt even one per hundred thousand vehicle mile
love see technology improves vision future let forget good old basic like tram subway bus
good point mass transportation still outperforms even best driverless car safety efficiency sometimes even comfort maglev train example mention important big as problem climate change car luxury generation really afford economics climate impact waste country almost many car citizen parked time wasteful unnecessary
company intentionally mentioning kind public transport trying promote thing sell would promote train especially bus competing product fun part though train already drive tech work well bus vehicle road lol
think biggest market autonomous truck
waymo crazy suspect first market ready full self driving would take one available question car back parking lot thing dont want uber like could also take train wich equivalent filthy thing expensive one meanwhile doesnt help deal still people road thinking motorcycle bicycle pedestrian
like personal taxi
want driverless streetcar bus road
think people said tech year away saying year away able drive road country like way could automatic car drive house work far see unless took long detour stay road always car wide also drive lot road single track road marking doubt would handle
really like idea fully autonomous everything
personally think automated transportation big step right direction reduce fatality hand still would prefer drive car dont trust software anything nice controll
road truck driver see many stupid action taken careless driver everyday self driving car eliminate impatience recklessness distracted driving im
favorite driverless car dont take space ruin city suburb contribute climate change nearly much single occupancy vehicle course use rail car cant walk cycle
good hitting animal always see dead hedgehog road car avoid hitting great news
issue driverless car car service thing issue uber taxi general didnt learn drive year old id always lived city never felt need taxi public transport abundant easy moved rural area year put able get uber wait hour bus train didnt get cancelled frequently struggling get taxi learned drive bought car completely changed life selfdriving car come soon ill getting one moment afford id love one probably wouldnt interested service like waymo least ubiquitous know rural area wont getting level service city long time highly doubt eliminate personal ownership vehicle selfdriving otherwise least year right jump car go supermarket shop home within min quick pop driving set aside hour trip even though giving extra time taxibus trouble actually took long even occasionally longer far often car service lot better id give car
looking self driving car im looking cameraman
future pretty much car like
would rather drive enjoy think safer
maybe thats car getting crap wouldnt want drive
im afraid machine job properly im afraid people abusing technology every advancement technolgy also mean advancement criminal potential
tesla approach make sense accumulate data also outside poenix arizona metropolitan area
yeah obviously picked area american style super caroriented citysuburb would curious would insane urban environment like nyc god forbid boston
course soon get outside u there whole world hurt different narrower road uk tiny cobbled hilly street italy packed road india thing challenge completely different magnitude think accomplish extremely soon
justinbooth really big deal driving road autonomously already
justinbooth thats changing variable work sure nothing scared would assume
theoryprototype go start smaller scale experiment also whats easier get permission single city expand launch whole country company make much sense tesla start small scale optimize process expand
paper published jmse final year mechanical engineer subsequent thesis didnt even finish grade vids inspiration derek would love meet ever australia
really need carless driver irresponsible cite high traffic fatality attributed human error conclude autonomous car solution rather investigate causing error intersection high accident rate many bad driver use intersection poorly designed safety city oslo norway achieved goal zero traffic fatality last year building safer road investing heavily infrastructure freeing people travel without car fact getting people car make healthier happier much le environmentally damaging nice added bonus
kit knight rider
people feel hurt another people conscious subconscious
million mile controlled drive includes test track
video feel like biased ad analysis scientist easy make autonomous car driving well right condition showed manage basically empty street middle summer condition like even baby drive safely traffic jam middle winter snow covering line road handling accident road car malfunction something simple an common broken light traffic controlled police officer people concern got ridiculed comparing people afraid elevator weird people making weird scenario elevator simple mechanism moving box closed rail system plane air automatic control follow preprogrammed path make micro correction weather car multitude constantly changing condition around even car get safe condition take street im concerned direction humanity head cant think society helpless fatty walle people cant even walk entire life got automated passively experienced nothing wasnt much experienced seems extreme maybe safety safety safety talk hard see way people constantly looking phone getting automated car people sitting automated chair constantly looking screen ahead difference slowly disappearing try drive car youll fined try get line robot force comply dont want live world like
self driving car new york city would take every day
want someone else driving car even put thought though trying watched cuz dont care total city slicker even watching way economy workin lately must wayy outa touch actual reality
driverless car boring car automatic gear
else reminded cyberpunk selfdriving taxi company watching
could considerable major developed country come developing neighborhood country everything yet organised may take way year adapt comply society
car stop best
real question autonomous car react poordistracteddrunk driver math make sense driverless car overnight bridge gap autonomous
took half second looking bos showing waymo hq clock shes brazilian
incharge operation ownership car gon na uber kind deal there talk private car ownership becoming thing past
incredible video cause everyone world watch video required viewing school
advertisement
penguinexpress literally change absolutely nothing
jacob marciniec public education system include sponsored material curriculum
cant wait try vietnam thailand indonesia people fill every inch ground youll dead mintues
safer road course hacking threat imagine car controlled hacker even video mentioned point used simple hack said vehicle mic stop hearing emergency alert sound using fake emergency alert sound anyone street make autonomous car stop
yeah car largely driving easily lifetime public transport becoming accessible dont see reason get driver license least live everyone around like need one im sitting like barely five minute walk bus stop whats point id pay much license car id barely ever use really im looking forward though self driving public transport bus driver im really inconsistent arrival time sometimes wont stop always account possibility still real pain xd
dont see point
still long way safe driverless car drive anywhere still way many mistake interpret whats around progress way faster expected one important thing keep mind many mistake happen get diagnosed code get written take kind situation account system never make particular mistake ever car whole fleet make mistake ever sure may still make mistake look similar u whole fleet learns one mistake made one car there still lot work progress faster imagine
im asking seatbelt steering wheel
people wont require driver lisence anymore
people lobbying government im gon na stop right
google tesla uber course theyre gon na lobby
fully autonomous car one worst thing possible considering capacity ai machine learning expecting operate human world driver assisted learning norm next decade there clean sheet extend time nonlobbyable technicalscientific body ass ongoing project agrees way ahead co fine dandy bot car kill someone driver driver bad enough untrained bot cant ass every situation possible useless
driverless car purpose rick drive gather intelligence law enforcement driverless car oh god rick welcome club pal
woah im phoenix hear
love video keep
thanks another amazing video much energy lidar system computational power cooling need
worried price lmao
imho noone love driving everyone using autonomous car id gladly join ill enjoy driving dinosaur juice powered pocket rocket
doesnt get tired angry impatient complacent inattentive jump joy normal part life
car malfunction responsible
ashley check profile agree im asking would responsible
anything would hate driving sitting driverless car
speed responsible
never ever thank first actually avoided couple car crash acting way ai would never done escape router wrong way free second fun pleasure driving thank
need away steering wheel give u two row seat facing already human driving car going one thing look back insane barbaric like putting lead paint
nope shouldnt car suck lifeblood away city take way much space way dangerous wether driven human
waymo tested wetter clime
pedestrian walk stationary car waymo serious car v pedestrian collision weve far
watch th element driverless cab solves problem
make think future cyber warfare would nation trying hack others autonomous car network imagine making every car road crash
yea cu people love thing destroy thing get power reason smh
talking king corruption car fall bridge
dont want tho never
hacking car may danger address like maybe car freeze vehicle compromised mode
alot car today hacked tho
uhh yeah see separatist alliance grow
waymo become expensive taxi system city tesla autonomy achieve actual full self driving anywhere current ai data dependent one data tesla also sensor actually increase complexity system make car make mistake waymos autonomy extremely misleading since bound specific area need mapped remapped regularly remain safe
plane crashed autopilot including plane brazil pitot tube wind speed indicator frozen plane got wrong data automatically yes get point
sixyearold upset found ten year car driving
gon na wild distant future people straight arent allowed drive anymore safe robot
derek totally safe viewer say derek company make viewer derek trust paid say mention million death human driver cause
self driving car fact statically safer self driving car data show
yeah way kinda trying imply like million people die car crash lot people die plane crash plane selfflying making car selfdriving get rid death ignoring big part reason many car death plane death people car lot theyre plane ten million people flew cessnas work every day air traffic control would lot plane death
human behavior factor though considerable portion humanity consists moron lack self control need supervisor
spectacularly light actual challenge isnt technical problem solve thats done already autonomous vehicle operating inside closed system decade problem arent technical problem social legal reason question car hit guy guy werent prepare situation learning reasonable person would thats jury convict car took reasonable action exec cant held accountable theyve got data prove normal ordinary reasonable person would video advert hope derek got stock option waymo
lovely propaganda
question want know isnt question actually go jail kill someone
want know clamming society really want know cause dont really care tbh
arturodelarosa question fundamentally going asked people die autonomous vehicle involved accident av used decade inside place like factory etc always place liability clearly defined theyre public place anyone entering area use covered liability insurance well sufficient signage safety measure indicate hazard autonomous vehicle public road different thing altogether go jail vehicle cause death historically regardless owner operator driver vehicle key individual held responsible given av driver longer exists buck stop
tyranneous oh somebody blamed mean say happen mean say problem stop advance technology take guess would say owner vehicleservice case waymo would blamed made pay complicated unlike current cab bus service bus kill somebody road deemed mechanical failure owner said bus would pay consequence legal financial company like waymo get insurance deal remember lower accident rate vehicle price said insurance low compared human wheel pay
arturodelarosa key point always driver sure operator fault first foremost driver default point culpability doesnt exist there problem problem people company there entire question safety standard well ass software meet certain level even define level think shouldnt regulated standard point made video technology already perfectly capable cost aside reduce incident accident isnt everywhere right people scared get one bunch yokel dont know magic technology standard regulation legal commercial ramification immense something video doesnt even bother talking
tyranneous disagree thinking mindset privately owned vehicle owner vehicle turn level autonomous autopilot crash car yes could problem need im idea owner purchase responsibility along autopilot tech unless talking many case becomes class action suit said waymos business model cab company ridesharing app somewhat le alike business model sold end user vehicle autonomous system sale unit transportation point point b immediately shift legal responsibility service provider way get cab crash driver said cab along company owns said cab service deal legal repercussion customer back cab autonomous driving work well specific business model legal responsibility clearly defined massively profitable service provider since save salary driver get much lower accident rate win win around autonomous driving sold service also mind specific case waymo doubt responsibility since even develop self driving tech build vehicle profit transportation service
fully autonomous vehicle scam possible real ai possible car drive autonomously restricted area fully autonomous
well would perfectly alright absolutely vehicle road autonomous dont think safe mixing human bot together
course safest scenario car autonomous car become autonomous thus better driver also increase overall safety car designed interact human driver thats reality would much easier build something work autonomous car would practical application outside specific space like maybe airport warehouse
parking lot gon na backed driverless car become prevalent car gon na stop every pedestrian one afraid start crossing time
dont know anyone think people good driver lmao
looking avoid people dying cost control population kind injury virus accident whatever think meant avoided keep facing global overpop issue part problem creating safety measure maybe im saying sound harsh specie planet one breaking fundamental
looking good perhaps someone navy could answer lidar interfere lidar example every car autonomous therefore saturating area laser could interfere
honestly im afraid elevator autonomous car
id love see random driver trying piss driver driverless vehicle
think youd piss passenger eventually random driver wont exist
exactly ai thats dangerous human accident due human making bad decision made bad decision point lead accident
possible people average driver odd throw much shade report seems likely driving wide skill plateau driver skill small contingent say bad driver throwing average downwards boom people average driver maybe
everyone start using autonomous car ai need good need right think
india driver cheaper driverless car
elon said lidor tech doomed waymo explan
driverless car india feel like atleast year away maybe
try india africa see really work
im cant wait camp
know people gon na abuse siren automatic pull feature
huge fan veritasium dont know much money google gave sponsor video must lot make abandon moral scruple regarding truth misleading statement video worse tv ad thats much manipulation misleading must scripted google let start elevator wonder people would still comfortable riding automatic elevator elevator navigate crossroad overtake elevator merge elevator highway etc guess probably elevator one simplest possible automatic system basic elevator need sensor level trigger stop besides would happen elevator misbehaves get wrong level elevator stop level wait technician get like crash lane divider kill misleading example automatic system everyone trust simply base comparison elevator selfdriving car next misleading example plane true plane nowadays mostly flown landed autopilot also true foggy condition difficult human land plane due limitation visual system far impossible human pilot simply follow reading runway radio beacon still land plane safely similar elevator example cross road merging traffic etc follow sensor bit complex three dimensional however know human pilot land airplane crosswind condition especially variable crosswind veritasium didnt give example go like example gave little stab tesla record think tesla even irresponsible regarding selfdriving tech truth current selfdriving ai technology deep neural network fundamentally unreliable due mathematics worse still like black box accident happens wouldnt even know happened veritasium want stake life technology give guarantee wont crash next lamppost certainly free new breed ai provably reliable explainable invented wont getting foot selfdriving car
car able move indian road
want autonomous vehicle really dont want vehicle want taxi
promissing need lot safety test think future like plane still driver yes ai good also manmade sooner later might fail also taking driving driving car people love driving car love car long take start interfere programming drive verrry safely doesnt mean problem end contrary present problem harder predict never much issue think could pilot city put car public use taxi need first learn passangers react
wait who taking shot
autonomous car probably way year away technology law attitude change notoriously resistant forward change
call privacy tool think google greatest company ever closely followed bell lab many bell lab people moved google
yey dont need drive
great video thank posting used opposed driverless car got hit drunk driver merging onto highway wouldnt happen car autonomous also head said three incident pedestrian hitting stationary waymo car per figure one actual contact two simulated also personbikerskateboarder hit stationary car usually quickly turn bail avoid getting hit another car
else lidar annotator remotasks
cant wait crackhead conspiracy nutjobs come field trip lmao
go road
future future
veritasium im sorry first video give dislike although hope remain last one long time first doesnt really contain really new information mostly repeat already quite common knowledge autonomous driving second way obvious video sponsered critical better please
car automatically driving place would mean time stuff see downside especially theyre safer human driver
ima start saying like self driving car downside put professional driver work truck driver uber driver etc largest profession adult male usa case accident fault solving legal conundrum cost car sky rocket point average person cant afford one dirverless car dont want programmed late cant drive mph speed limit order make bit time hooked g big brother watching
ya ya ya happens car start talking programmer want
gon na extra front seat
lmao verified
job loss driver unemployment
soorajsuseelan theyll sitting technical office
yeah unfortunately mean extra passenger ride way homeless shelter guy excited crapdid ever stop think whats going happen million middle class career small business vaporize overnight
soorajsuseelan like talking job loss people mine doesnt matter people go time time
camera additional point failure lidar system incredibly complex system even possible point failure likelihood two eyeball mark brain mark possibly failing catastrophically given moment way lower sudden unexpected catastrophic failure camera complex mechanical optical electronical part dont even get started software error imagine one single faulty update know well eg window version hundred maybe even thousand even autonomous car receive time let say instance monday morning right everyone drive work besides human dont need trained much extensive period time huge amount data point able cope unexpected situation react without even trained always successfull thats true still think human outperform autonomous system far dealing situation havent trained data available autonomous system thing capable awesome result evolutionary process began something billion year ago nothing sneered either thanks thanks im still convinced autonomous car feasible near mean future
good condition technology currently work computer ive seen work good condition going trust life computer car
like missed part accident fault human accident even pedestrian accident ding dong running van scary tech scary ooga booga fire bad
gon na walk stair huh
yeah tech cool live would eat self regularly get snow heavy enough lidar system would fail rain hard enough would fail get hot cold enough would fail awesome tech ready everywhere yet lol
dragoonpreston wow
matter time work condition thats power ai dont necessarily need better code make better need data make better
driverless car cool flashy real future comprehensive accessible public transport tbh transport people etc etc
insurance company dont like one
que video car plowing pedestrian
would like see real life rain snowblizzard condition
trust car every human driver dont trust
one advantage one rob driver isnt one p
thats future finally
great please stop showing nonsense beautiful ballet car going intersection direction work computer trust thing still go wrong need gap still reason human cant drive close isnt arent capable thing go wrong need space stop react computer different except dont need much space example shown way way close
work bad weather
think autonomous car shouldnt totally replace normal car mean driving way get somewhere many people way enjoyment strange may seem reading driving actually something people enjoy wouldnt want sit looking car window want go drive somewhere without destination want drive want maneuver vehicle im way occupy understand genuinely better result fully automate car people would enjoyable thing sitting car still feel like option drive manually want default would automated driving want go adventurous want go manual option yes people wouldnt use want choice
wether road work lol
hahahaha went cant take
wh
theyre using test car edit timestamp
nezt video want train instead road
""
exactly problem selfdriving car isnt theyre selfdriving theyre car
issue least u weve built huge subdivision system isnt trainfriendly need different solution
greeny train suburb though turn subdivision walkable neighborhood give bike path local shop etc impossible u walkable neighborhood destroyed make sprawl
greeny switching autonomous vehicle would exacerbate urban sprawl problem
first autonomous vehicle leg
need frenemies road
regard public road safety performance data whitepaper prove vehicle safe merely guess enough data make statistically significant claim rate collision result severe injury death problematic make completely informed comparison human driver
one step disconnect people reality
who going kill noone itll know kill anyone itll predict might happen act accordingly look tesla autopilot video enough car speed red light whilst others crossing manages stop right move way think situation youd never think like car next suddenly changed lane etc accident either way fewer comparison human accident b le unavoildable
im sorry many year experience mile driving want reword
could say way mo experience human
win
see
yuitr loing agree get pun though
underrated comment
indian roadsallow u introduce
think biggest mental step human make wanting car take time asked random people street wanted cell phone back first becoming widely available said didnt want reachable phone every point day look changed
thank video antitech fearmongering drive crazy send video people say irrational thing self driving car
id love fl especially near theme park honestly people cant drive area way many people area would help reduce congestion much
dont self flying plane self driving car plane sound much easier automate
autonomous vehicle solution search problem want driven cant bothered park pay cab rideshare want reduce carbon emission take bustrain ride bike city make easier people thing want eliminate traffic fatality make stricter licensing requirement increase penalty actually revoke license violation traffic law national standard driver education make mandatory license application reduce number people driving encouraging safer method travel slow traffic prioritize pedestrian traffic urban area
large portion vehicle road autonomous communicate share much gained experience real time also road future facilitate autonomous driving example bus lane driverless bus without road sign traffic light
like idea driverless car robot cool stuff automate better also like driving fun feel research development stagnated resurgence car made express purpose fun drive say wouldnt get autonomous vehicle would good long family road trip would still definitely keep around like corvette stingray thats one car would love drive
car waymo interesting car
bag thing seeing getting old
autonomous system didnt work well boeing max followed lobbying coverups etc trying build car future operate within obsolete system road material marking pedestriancycling inclusion collaboration auto manufacturer technology leader transportation engineer etc create intertwined vehicleinfrastructure system
absolutely adore pause face statement
computer told people lazy sometimes wont thing
ill pas rather drive fun sitting backseat
putting people work
talk tesla silent car dangerous blind low vi people
elaborate
drunk frat kid uber yoo bro get aux car
itd better spent energy building metro railway rather conforming automobile youmustownacar american culture
derek needed extra money weekone big waymo infomercial course manufacturer product sell going say safer human driver
someone accidentally put instead somewhere trillion transistor chip
world programming term functional another way saying full bug dont much sneeze itll break catastrophically year though kink worked going become mainstream quickly
wonder selfdriving car would mean people would get worsened skill eyesight reflex article indicate lot people sit much inside watching screen eye adapted short sighted good thing weve got le physical strength example hand strength gripping lot weaker many hundred year ago say get weaker time get lazier would possible problem selfdriving car im curious could affect health others
worsened people dont use much used personal choice decide use socalled skill level good people past
frostdirt far source go short amount time believe like say possible recover thing question long time would take
thing find problematic selfdriving car distract u better solution already promise reduce overall traffic improve safety efficiently use resource allow relax even work moving towards destination public transport already
ghost driver trying crash frontal wrong turn system get hacked system bandwidth problem due g g due server side software crashed driving software crash point think u cant compare ariplanes important system redundant overall yes bug sorted flawless average driver today hope need see something wrong avoid crash system tell surrounding car whats happen react big deal considering land rocket ai landing smooth possible take time lesson learn
would human driver different encryption large screen big city rarely hacked figure bandwidth matter map software controlled camera thats going rare becomes developed mean think much auto pilot crash
anyone remember journalist killed fbi hacking merc
maybe sunny day cali ice covered road snowy condition think people right tech need alot work
drive ice wont know respond besides supposedly arent deploying intense weather condition
think easy overcome ready looking lidar differentiate road ice would able avoid take precaution
think one feature auto cab need inside sensor determine youve left anything inside mistake
ill bet number car replaced autonomous vehicle see disproportionately small return reduction accident caused human error guy speeding along safeway storefront lane parking lot everyone walk know guy guy never believe computer drive better meanwhile responsible driver adopting regular usage waymolike autonomous car step guy run course itll help get people real problem theyll driving drunk humancontrolled car longer sold anywhere im draconian nature stop building car better every year save people crash start building avoid altogether risk freedom reward life taken someone weve probably never met making decision life important specific agenda hitting bar taking damn car home damn night screw uber cost buck unlike bar tab obviously theyll buy someone drink night screw paying bar tab safe transportation may time inform people longer trusted immense responsibility driving demonstrating many year pas drive test night make decision get shitfaced designated driver friend home ugh people
htvlog go channel im ive noticed anecdote worse friend driving think stupidity everyone el fault vehemently hate idea handing control computer hypothesis u responsible driver actual risk assessment etc riding car objectively better human driving worst worst still driving car like complete moron im sure attitude fade time first decade two self driving car really common think people wed like see self driving car last one step one
im excited day dont need car anymore really hope within next year becomes norm schedule seat ev take need go
many sensor possible possibility error close zero impossible
pro vaxx people pro self driving car people die self driving car overall fewer death ignoring pro mask important
want continue working home cause dont want drive crazy traffic numbnuts driving need doctor write note dont drive work anyone
definitely trust car human driver im ready
charging combine electric solar kinetic energy tire movement wind energy via turbine catch wind side vehicle move
screw driverless car screw electric car like drive drive cammed l
controlled computer hope would mean speed limit could increased dont ever drive distracted dont phone listen music smoke eat etc speed im trying get somewhere rest distracted mfers make driving look hard computer allow vehicle go mph issue always communicating
predict becomes common designated road automatic car speed limit high
concern complex make cost add end user many camera lidar much cost add top basic car
becomes mainstream cheaper look car computer cost
would need switch every vehicle electric shorter time span chaos manual driver would cause
im gon na try
one sided video shouldve talked george hotz someone else expert topic biased instead one woman who employee company took sponsorship
arent going put million people work though happens truck driver ride share job like uber
main issue people driving manually people road rage
rarely find one video one sided
cant wait mainstream decade imagine hitting bar car bring home without worry
take bus cab far le expensive far reliable autonomous vehicle solution search problem
max year see comercial car technology
disappointing sponsored content much paid advertisement always look forward channel content lacking alot critical thinking come expect
like idea fully autonomous vehicle never want forced everyone like drive sometimes offroad cant autonomous vehicle
asiana flight manual control radio beacon thats automated plane work well guidance assistance runway typically plane time react surprise car
take autonomous vehicle shove human always want control
yeah annoying af think would like bunch boomer soccer mom drive speed limit time cause accident never get one
wowin beautiful past culturesthere atomicno electricity appliance facility people saidmay future higher technlogy future theme living present thinking time machine gadgetsand saying hypothetical actually future era high technology like time machine hypothetical thing future youth say ancestor lived simple life technology responsible destruction progress
lol said cock
anyone notice whats missing animation pedestrian cyclist
happen system get bugor start malfunctioning
cant live road rage car tryna hit
love one
sorry car auto braking feature night dark detect wall mention also seen issue heavy rain little lone fact live place snow one testing auto driving car snowy condition yet definitely ready
love idea also agree many people careless irresponsible distracted thing including driving machine better
billion mile experience right lane car come australia uk drive left
small adjustment coding testing problem would resolved
would test program car work road area
fake car paid actor
still e stop button modern waymo car
another question would widespread adoption autonomous vehicle lead end either traffic congestion parking lot people arent physically driving vehicle doesnt mean wont still want personally one always ready ondemand case point public transportation usage hasnt outpaced personal vehicle usage national level
there also issue pandemic thing like flu season lot reason transport public vehicle idea happened inside ive worked janitor ill say people disgusting place like public bathroom know whats going go type thing
well public transporation way different worse experience public transporation work great city actually developed fully like stockholm sweden people skip getting license cause public transportation good autonomous vehicle definitely help traffic congestion synchronization vehicle talking g huge parking lot lessened le people car people still number reduced
city inconvenient car difficult find available parking spot close want go easier faster cheaper call autonomous taxi pick drop want without worry finding parking spot
siogg im surein fact seriously doubtfewer people personal vehicle market autonomous vehicle saturates yes congestion lessened strongly disagree significant ie order magnitude also remember g still cellular network imagine bandwidth necessary synchronize million autonomous vehicle imagine choking network traffic small set tower get clobbered along highway twice day rush hour
niconico possible wrote one would think argument requirement least convenience would apply existing technology public transport transportationforhire yet existence thingsalmost old automobile itselfhas yet significantly change personal transport whats driverless car difference
sunshine rainbow edge case weather happen
without watched cant imagine would trust le driver ive seen road
exactly
one day likely perfectly efficient selfdriving public transit save u land energy time good better joe really need basically
want autodrive yr ago problem transitioning think stop dicking around waiting perfect even viable fullyallroad self driver start designating lane area zone highway known optimal condition additional aid installed make partially practical right
capable selfdriving others likely jaywalk stop traffic light there going tipping point people asshole look recent event large lifted truck blocking ev charging station someone going spray paint lidar sensor shut entire fleet
already close sold idea driverless car video made want tell every one know invest im excited future driverless car
im afraid driverless car hope dont ever become mandatory driving one favorite thing
airplane autpilot well year yet still option manual vfr flight dont worry
car fine planeim sure plane fully autonomous pitot tube block autopilot lost sense altitute speed crash hey autolanding rocket already
driver employment technology make u unemployment
want u unemployed slave system resist
stop getting confused moon murdering pedestrian elon musk fuck forever dont trust driverless car
bohdankhmelnytsky weird question
option turn automatic door wouldnt want others definitely would
vehicle react crazy driver giving finger
speeding doesnt crash thats horrible assumption derek
plot twist video sponsored waymo
wut
tbh kinda one sided show bad well
talk safety welp take danger thing whats point anything
true sometimes danger fun imagine air soft walking eating want basically freedom
aaronrubiogerdts welcome future control want u experience free take blackpill still available
ha first derek deceptive use statistic way
id absolutely feel weird hopping driverless car living driving long time feel uncomfortable im passenger even like dad know incredible driver someone id trust even worst road imagine unnerving control vehicle said id trust ai human every scenario right virtually every scenario experience selfdriving car im sure stated video overwhelmingly vast majority accident happen human error selfdriving car isnt going hit stationary object unless something gone catastrophically wrong selfdriving car isnt going hit something reversing going reverse traffic unless someone come flying around corner swerve oncoming traffic selfdriving car isnt going go road unless road condition poor anyone would go road like iced case selfdriving car execute needed manuever try correct better average human selfdriving car would never drive wrong lane swerve around road whereas see eye behaviour worse every single day youre driving every single time drive anywhere dont live super busy town million driver see people phone paying attention road could cause accident regularly see people take turn poorly enter lane bit see people swerve road instead staying centered lane every person who ever driven seen people road speed among million thing human every single day increase risk accident thing selfdriving car wouldnt area concern people special case people worried ai might react completely unforseen circumstance people believing decisionmaking power human required think could get selfdriving car road people would become comfortable theyd see handle unforseen situation properly relax
large community car lover world like drive effort u im wd lover autonomous car zero interest defeat purpose trust thats issue blatant dislike idea car become established law follow nobody allowed drive road safety reason safety used control population future see using covid today fact every dictatorship established via idea greater good wouldnt work otherwise car another cog technocracy great idea necessarily generate great consequence dont like driving walk jog pushbike horse ride catch bus train ferry cab solution kill people passion driverless car like dont enough option already
thats play city skyline traffic light thats computer baby
autonomous vehicle obvious succession however city doublingtripling mass transit train always efficient hundred car
cool thing feed one biggest reason people dont take public transit called last mile problem train doesnt stop within walking distance work dont take driverless car could fix lining every train stop people would much willing take public transit trip train line reasonable
barongerhardt ai janitor
barongerhardt got camera pay credit card theyll fine spirit airline release budget fleet
barongerhardt people used would receive funding autonomous car public transportation begin would mean pay luxury
rossesmond mile considered unwalkable ok bus bicycle scooter technocrat solution problem never one begin
auto car neat lack one thing never foresight intuition
well foresight predicting future action computer getting really good intuition thing probably never learnt ever necessary almost accident happen human intuition wrong wouldnt want logic based decision making
want driverless car soon possible reasonable regulation including appropriate mean assigning liability however rarely go wrong something trust even company like waymo think largely well implement without oversight however minute paid endorsement seems also accepted money patreon patron im baffled passed ethical muster derek communicator educator part way veritasium time
wow love car obvious there lot hard work put bring india please
likely make human transparent use already highly ai world make self driving vehicle clearly
ive hears lidar doesnt work well rain wonder true
camera advanced lidar still better human hear human dont drive well rain either

blackdiamond hasnt happened yet saying wasnt happened never happen isnt good argument
dont even need go far driverless car would get wrecked usa territory bring puerto rico guarantee crash within day driving destroy suspensionbraking system
technology year away never come safely driving arbitrary road requires actual intelligence mean human intelligence youre okay unsafe driving flying board max right sure mcas getting faulty data wont notice ram ground thats small price pay living future aka dying present course elevator subway drive autonomously traffic road arent like
lot people feel little bit unsure someone else driving unless theyve spent lot hour person driving know know theyre focused often would rather drive ride people know good driving vehicle tell right away youll feel confident
handle mechanical failure like blown tire
would autonomous vehicle decrease parking lot
elevator driver who young know called elevator operator
call train driver conductor doesnt change fact theyre driving train
ever watched movie

know people always talk human mistake driverless car would never make nobody ever talk computer mistake human would never make like mistaking full moon red light driving rural road without marking anything else surely thing human would never driverless car likely nobody talk stuff
tesla autopilot x safer human driver
want suck driving dont plan getting better important tweet post effbook rap much le pay attention road youre cool bus machine programmed crap driver drive better mediocre driver
argument nonsensical proven wrong countless time eg chess computer deepblue easily outclassing programmer
regarrzo really chess finite move lot move finite nonetheless driving never thats two different tesla two different year slide semi trailer didnt see fail able turn interaction without trying hit parked car driving playing chess texting socialist medium amd machine suck requires real intelligence false programmed one
absolutely functional car driven around chandler az subset street literally year mapping every inch sometimes see three side side stop light thats autonomous driving thats mapping variable knowing road condition using tech like lidar simply expensive mass production owned fsd tesla four year told back coming day watching struggle navigate parking lot tech long way car cant back garage without taking second beeping stopping struggling want know fsd buy tesla fsd try level
hello dirt road sensor react becomes fully blocked
imagine getting pulled officer promise wasnt speeding away car wont pull light
nd thing make sure cant get hacked
wow made entire video safety self driving car without mentioning uber car ran lady wtf
thats get vid sponsored self driving car company
im passionate car driving really dont like fast car changing worst situation cant disagree alot people cant drive save life
let get autonomous train first talk
autonomous car kill people theyre safe whats stopping ppl walking road stopping traffic need minor degree psychothapy ppl wont know car might run
mehhhhhhh car sickness besides see bigfoot side road get robo car quick u turn take photo
ive got admit thats beautiful parallel car elevator
yes building hundred elevator crossing path constantly like busy road
driverless car purpose rick drive gather intelligence law enforcement driverless car oh god rick welcome club pal
jakobvanklinken ig dont know parallel mean doesnt mean exactly fyi
responsible case accident know never happen ok never happen
used drive taxi accident someone stuck intersection could see light coming traffic proceeded cause almost head accident also involved two rear end collision vehicle stopped first traffic light guy behind thought light lane changed car left turn lane started moving traffic came stand still freeway next car struck close mph personally blame three additional accident year taxi driver calculate time drove mile used average day week although often worked day week year often worked hour even worked day straight napping trip nap allowed get enough sleep need quit working much hour per day said possibly accident case forgot one year year prove average however know amazing driver aspired like father drove home work back job home every day year roughly year still transported family shopping place father often trip work mile sometimes summer would take mile detour way work drop brother sister grandma house way work pick u way home involved accident person fault zero accident name year miss old man still aspire drive good man time watched amazement eminent accident avoided pulling crazy maneuver somehow slipped u gap around swerving vehicle avoiding seemingly avoidable accident man skill waymo sound like dad driving skill
coming big city five yearsfrom look video seems like next year guess getting pas government regulator
saw video web vibration symmetry intrigued lighten tell science behind
maybe donate proceeds video driver hundred thousand per city get work elevator operator facepalm economic nuke
im ready autonomous car greater safety one car chauffeured professional driver people worried driver losing job still lot thing rider able transported one location another many job actually become efficient fact quite job could created result technology delivery driver become delivery rider uber lyft rider would necessary several reason also take positive mindset towards think valuable reason job driver still rider either way coming looking best way make probably better fighting
incredibly complex software point single human understand thats talking deployed potentially million device holding living breathing human certainly see potential advantage also see scenario one bad code push end killing hundred thousand people way nobody could seen coming scale come potential serious consequence good bad
look great city cant see navigating campground ive gone dont believe would cheaper rental v buying car used daily either
id absolutely fine honestly climb backseat cab onto bus idea driver good safe driver poor driver automation would consistently good
even consistently good predictable
ive seen waymo would trust drive around condition operate sae level autonomy yet doesnt mean trust provider similar level uber tesla instance yes thats including autonomy need better average human worthwhile im convinced others demonstrated theyre better average person
dont know live finland least certain level training required become bus driver used certain level training knowledge required get taxi license able drive taxi would indicate driver least base level skill
autonomy need significantly better average human though people risk assessment whole lot control situation people general much calm driving compared driven someone else partly reason people scared plane control situation obviously may emergency stop button probably removed start causing harm good people going satisfied driverless car good average driver average driver actually pretty bad many people going killed driverless car
pwhnckexstflajizdryvombqug two big factor one least good average threshold introduction expected continue improving second worst driver cause disproportionate amount crash fatality replacing average ability would significant improvement safety
driving car fun thing opinion
dont problem driverless car per se technology tend replace job lower level society shouldnt managerless ceoless company
thank much hope technology cant help skeptical take allays concern
tesla also thing different
want replace car driverless one
cant wait
get hacked said hacker create havoc company
thats true would extremely hard hack example often spaceship get hack lunching
bro drive tesla
people get vehicle take people job away
biggest reason dont feel comfortable self driving car take away democratization owning car dumbass learn repair internal combustion engine self driving car extremely complex machine handful people planet equipped maintain repair become ubiquitous would lend easily monopoly thing apple iphone fix charge as want
true car self driving would save ten thousand people year death hundred thousand injury
callumwilde yes
dont get people see computer controlling deathtrap bad thing thousand die day car crash common cause car accident directly related people causing problem two directly caused human rain car defect could solved computer charge well appropriate amount caution driving slippery road low visibility completely irrelevant car able check every component actually going anywhere pleeeeaaaase replace easily distracted emotional monkies perfectly logical computer seamlessly communicate cooperate every computer road
perfectly said
video much trusting car human mistake question good system work trust mean like question perfekt computer system make mistake perfekt system
saying system already almost perfect getting rejected people dont trust
good condition technology currently functional word limit question point automation safer average average human driver also want know im hurt suffer financial damage accident caused autonomous vehicle sue
would incredible unlike think would sue developer car unless signed contract new law enforced
callumwilde thats question legal liability
feel kinda like something douglas adam would write someone solved one leading cause death made huge leap bound transportation safety unfortunately world already fire one would ever get see everything burned ground
long dont add animatronic driver like johnny cab total recall ill problem hopping driverless car
one day hit old age want driving everywhere would drive use autonomous vehicle want danger others vehicle
one problem tested public road violates basic principle experimental testing human subject informed consent essentially used test subject without consented
u kidding right
ok test houston
get driverless construction site lay foundation building laying utility clearing away debris
type thing way closer driverless car like product buy instead manual operation one
cab driver might loose job
people believe theyre better average driver think somewhat accurately judge would ask many time youve crashed bumped something somebody honk think people maybe probably reasonably decent driver probably people sometimes good driver day get unlucky mean slip fall walking doesnt mean youre bad walker
one always problem b question car hit thats accident work car break try stop like every human would
think airplane example bit one sided crash max exact opposite example max crash automatic system override human pilot corrected plane nose malfunctioning thought plane nose high
sigh time would eaten still kindof agree cant totally watch video within last year dude testing model crossing left lane road run trial recording w drone setup multiple camera test fsd report bug probably brought turn dozen time numerous time car completely misread mash brake realize tesla doesnt offer level autonomy waymo wish discussed limitation driverless tech general pro con lidar camera kind thing cause autonomous car get confused crash ethic loved one die due someone el mistake road v casualty computer error bad sponsorship probably prevented discussion asked ultimate question episode better average human wouldve nice hear fleshed answer instead enthusiastic yes waymo engineer arguably context statistic thing arent perfect sunny suburb phoenix arent exactly representative average road america maybe talk transportation board official something sorry derek big fan think video little one sided
number one reason self driving future computer dont ego need prove road
computer cant put value life either
jesuscabelloschomburg sure quick math
jesuscabelloschomburg bro human cant either lol google list war death toll
jesuscabelloschomburg thats bad dont think one monkey important another boohoo tragedy
kinggrimm choice like two old people one kid two old people already lived life whereas kid whole life ahead believe thats jesus said one mean one commented

anyone notice car due oil change make wonder service available public driver vehicle way knowing tire light vehicle inspected every morning example one person would put everyones life jeopardy would driver responsibility know oil change due imagine service snowy condition engine lock lose heat fact change engine oil message brings question automation way detecting vehicle problem need tire brake shake slowing high speed inspection done brake car know brake grinding obd automation computer hookup would required minimum tell obvious problem like light dash vehicle like bmws brake pad sensor brake condition issue would somewhat fixed van new vehicle also throw code specific exterior lighting open circuit would normally indicate blown bulb
would highwaycity full lidar equipped car interfere ignore noise
ive read past possiblity beam one lidar get scattered interfere another lidar sensor close proximity possible although dont know likely happen
city full cellphone transmitting wifi interfere
think would interfere though camera tesla proposing would
almicc hop frequency handle
almicc yes ton go sport venue test
im sure excited ride autonomous car full trash filth take ride day one keep clean
well like camping roading ill stick regular truck
way get rid traffic called public transportation done right work really well proven technology american probably never adopt like car much precisely selfdriving car wont solve traffic problem either
thanks phone laptop freeze crash time dont need risk car driven computer
us laser beam oh yeah anti g idiot incoming
believe automatic car still dangerous skilled well redted driver drive id rather rely ability tbf
anna yo check vid wtf thots commenting comment madness
like highly trained yearold speed driving around
quantum processor would make autonomous car reality think many additional task car cpu process per second split second simultaneously reaction time instantaneous
im calling never work florida
derek please negotiate access next time sure lot interesting stuff behind scene think everything already part waymos pr year ago
hell suicide vehicle computer without error
car moving pedestrian skateboarder cyclist ran car car suddenly stopped front causing crash
would excuse suddenly stopped front someone causing crash
might work arizona nice weather good driving condition poor condition bad weather ice snow would trust autonomous driving little handle poor weather poor road condition
waymo infomercial derek sad
conversation advanced company
visit china
imagine thinking carcentric development totally ok eventually well putting life hand shitty code hacked together deployed car suck autonomous car suck continuing plague american urban sprawl criminal
mean thing manual control airplane work essentially scenario theoretically human nature worry stress etc however computer take entirely objective approach may well best approach lot situation loved video
would watch second ad free ride
never ever ever ever ever driverless car end freedom freedom go please please never one get one
atlas want drive love driving fun dont want disengaged process besideswindows around sincewhat early still screw time trust autonomous car attentive human driver perfectly fine cool legally blind person drive car though long driverless car dont completely replace regular car still drive im cool road want need

love ai car tech involved amazing different electric car sense id love people adopt id love ai ev said dont want ability drive taken away even something simple driving grocery store fun im mood wouldnt even mind ping ai stating hey car coming human driven watch totally fine error likely argument even better would able drive work ai im drive taxi people around hour work day done efficiently enough could almost eliminate parking lot
juxtaposition video recently found youtube channel talk urban planning development made realize dreadful american city compared european city future le car mixed zoning bicycle path
submitted video veritasium contest good luck competitor
day thing become available theyll become mandatory
good human way dumber computer car accident rate would drop instant
veritasium make video showing actual barometer summit mount everest
always thought needed good enough autonomous vehicle needed good average driver glad know already gone milestone btw class autonomous vehicle dangerous one hahah
dont think india driving issue road like ant highway
quick video experience snow ice u canadian also donut
saw video almost identical year back said fully automated road within next year
well car machine learning problem used object detection mean specific case situation may make completely false prediction may cause accident make error fix never happen human tend make mistake several time next thing least autonomic car street see change infrastructure car guess sign overgrown tree sender tell car information example
much much cost buy one run talking toyota camry base model closer tesla bugatti number
type car wouldnt massive lidar interference
ive always though car autonomous today technology fatal car accident would basically cease exist yes software buggy come hardware kill people always rigorous safety measure incidentally people dont innately
trust car anyone road anyday dont want traffic anymore autonomous vehicle solution human traffic
insurance company getting nervous right
least good condition woohoo made technology work good condition blind person could drive safely good condition
difference good condition blind person would straight road nobody pedestrian comfortable something crash end oneway trip whereas good condition selfdriving car properly maintained road clear weather otherwise normal traffic everyday driver real world
nightstick even generous definition good condition happen nearly often enough technology considered mature testing approval least ten year away still wont seeing self driving car become mainstream least year anyone think well seeing car everywhere within five year either naive delusional
moment im okay self driving car driver car left trust matchine person
waymo fully automated understandingthe team plot route ahead time car us predetermined key point
would like see perform india
youve convinced
semi trucker car racer want vast majority people autonomous car really dont know drive properly
sign want take ride
derek high conducted interview high
feel like derek testing whether notice title thumbnail change
issue driverless car never safe rather secure vehicle largely revolves around complex software job attack external source becomes major worry recognize like derek say issue going exceedingly rare none le still important unfortunately way know would prevalent get fully autonomous car road asshole decides hack one prove point malicious intent think fully autonomous car inevitability safe form reliable transportation certainly early adopter
current state government sincerely think gain control start car cant according government want good point perspective video lost arent free express live positive side
yeah end itll person seaters driverless car everywhere road whats point
im excited driving terrifies driven doesnt scare behind wheel
currently still lot skepticism autonomous vehicle play real world eg idiot jerk abound easy would get fake siren force waymo car side road make joltingunpredictable movement near sidewalk get car think im fly street slam break like
think would help improve lot everyone would like change afraid change reality
imagine able say im guy pushing cart veritasium
thing autonomous vehicle good following protocol programmed part isnt programmed eventually get real life experience new programming propagate throughout fleet become better incident hasnt programmed
feel like sooner car go fully robotic sooner eventually see car flying car thing let face people stupid sooner put computer control car sooner upgrade something hybridize saying next logical leap pathing automated car become thing also mean le people friggin die people stupid stuff drunk car able keep people safe stuff
google car ugly heck cute imo
arhh stretching veritasium conclusion areu sing data highly tainted confirmation bias ideal youre taking reference class old limited car camera using killstats proof modern carsmachines like camera much better circumstance people dated car new car camera many sensor multiple camera human like camera topend sensor help bet stats would way different socalled reference class machine many many time better machine machine good programmed certain thing limited leats intuition situation awareness tone video lack neutral honest perspective youre coming across like paid video waymo chase funding likely also video many thumb way veritasium video arhh yep say text bad backboneless aussie derek paid waymo sponsoring video want funding waymo concluded using influencer social medium right fit waymo sponsored video see text description fair enough least informed thx though using social medium influencers lubricate public chase coin one slippery slope least scandinavian perspective aint common asia north america
sorry elon lidar needed nvm
whats johnny cab without johnny driver seat
creepy
derek one topic non discus autonomy electric supposes car need nap journey maybe several driving study test long journey like mile range limit car car charge question mechanical wear
autonomous vehicle software implemented nowadays humandriven car simply way give ai extensive amount data learn word software learn cant actually use drive car way computer exposed million daily situation
cant wait self driving car think wrong economic impact part self driving wont fix car sitting time use time without change dont see theyll eliminate rush hour
autonomous vehicle youd paramedic readily available thing outside motor accident officer wouldnt giving driving ticket
plane analogy would work vehicle road mile apart control tower people directing individual vehicle traffic
yeah plane analogy really disingenuous there nothing hit selfdriving car bus spent time milewide empty road dont intersect stop station there dozen people carefully monitoring arrival every step yeah probably wouldnt lot crash elevator analogy even worse elevator train private track switch intersection go slow actually crash
id love see highway merging lane change coming right left turn snow response stubborn driver letting merge letting directing around closed road accident construction technology big thing lot people need know handle situation
much shouldve video least mentioned open question closest got real inquiry video two minute covering waymos study data minute minute repeating different way believe safe even sponsored video im disappointed
think kind missing point car would able handle situation better people could awareness faster reaction time
sorbital yes know say havent shown u would react snowing vehicle start fishtail would require sensor detect would react another driver letting merge onto highway traffic pre determined route would react sudden accident closing road construction worker stopslow sign think techbology awesome even though im car enthusiast want know would react thing like something cutting stop sign
le people driving issue shrink especially car communicate eventually able drive much faster similar irobot
doms oh yeah definitely saying id like see situation moment human driver majority next year
usually see near google campus mountain view ca kind wish small driverless vehicle take work day
phoenix live close bruh never thought youd
even though statistically true five year still unknown factor came car manufacturer either choose adopt destroy
tesla
meanwhile elon insists tesla doesnt need lidar go full autonomous end year right
world driverless car difficult implement chaotic climate environment sure likely people one ride share program kinda like uber one question remains case emergency might need car immediately
driver day get distructed easily vertassium distracted educational video talk future driverless taxi improves life without even hinting negative economic impact kind technology
know address problem part world dont road u thats fact road u fairly easy ass try placing car outside city weather road condition btw video sponsored
seems like technology still bit wonky come uncertain situation hard break shopping parking lot guy sidewalk dead giveaway also ready handling human directing traffic snow unpredictable situation also dying mistake horrible thing dying computer made mistake even worse
hey derek please stop giving neolib vibe havent made enough money yet dont get disappointing selfishness neoliberalism corporatism nonos science learn feynman
people think driverless car arent safer human driver silly people think human doctor pinnacle medicine
world need
want delamain talk ride
one risk ive seen nobody address increased risk lower extremity blood clot long trip autonomous vehicle people able make long trip sleeping however sitting conventional car seat increase risk dvt passenger seat need fully recline alleviate risk
presentor talking non sence level misleading people
id love know mean
think autonomous car amazing see one big bad point mentioned rebound effect people dont drive work rest entertain themselve car wont mind speeding time making bigger trip thats could potentially greatly reduce benefit traffic mostly completly opposite regard climate change
still say year away
really like driving dont want drive catch bus dont catch bus
question would handle rural area like line road turn gravel road deer animal hop road well difficult driving condition like heavy snow black ice
self driving car could crash kill people day still safer regular people
first fine letting year old road wayy comfortable driverless car second fully autonomous vehicle also reduce traffic able communicate move time le accident see accident open google map see traffic cuz accident like everyday thats insane im sure accident going rare sighting autonomous vehicle like elevator analogy never hear elevator incident happen super rare im sure multiple time life involved accident weve normalized yet people scared technological solution
moment car ride transport person average autonomous driving optimistic get number really need walkable neighbourhood good public transport ai car wont fix traffic problem much likely make worse
basically watched min ad
""
answer question thumbnail way many idiot driving
every one legend see indian road
nice idea live rural area ton various animal love come across constantly shifting road conditionsrain leaf snow mud debris windstorm snow etc feel driverless car would cause accident quickly
chivalrous halfsister reassembly dance change peroperativly unlike ruthless william shallow necessary lilac
excellent video still friend say never get selfdriving car presented death stats always claim would happen really arrogant natural disaster occurs like indian tsunami whole world grief number people die annually usa car accident people respond like driving get car road rounding nearest percent eliminate accident
people believe average driver think well could actually true distribution driver tailed worst driver way worse average best driver bit better average median driver could better mean driver thus could potentially average
mesure driving ability
minute advertisement honey
ride bus point
wouldnt need driverless car stringent regular driver test harsher punishment law insurance reckless driving public endangerment duo distracted driving racing speeding etc
dont need outlaw cause mortal accident road fault happen moment put said place everyone driving paranoia mean driving way slower could taking turn way safely thus greatly reducing flow traffic automated car wouldnt loss efficiency
adl put said place everyone driving paranoia mean driving way slower could taking turn way safely thus greatly reducing flow traffic fair point think happen mostly start make sudden abrupt change law regulation make gradual change people adapt smoothly may get slower daily traffic road reduce probability accident reduces everyones insurance gas cost
like video agree said video feel like putting slight spin
driverless car drive icy condition month would board think fall kind flat state boarding canada get alot snow almost half year typically
yall ever heard ofmass transit
take mountain tennessee let know autonomous ride work
drive real road northern michigan january call
suspect one main unconscious factor resistance automated car perceived absence culpability accident human cause accident concrete agent pin blame ignoring incidence grayarea accident clear case usually driver get blamed automated vehicle company manufacturing maintaining vehicle certainly going bear culpability feel bit removed accustomed recent experience life taught many u western world difficult painful seek recompense large effectivelyinhuman entity like company conveniently ignoring experience dealing personal insurance company course get past eventually likely without growing pain along way
sorry lost one follower science go advertisment selfdriving car society uberization
video strong town
automation thing like ask absolutely despise technology thing without asking
must love microsoft word
targens seeing joke sorry guess either word unhelpful helpful way general mean thing like autocorrect automatic grammar spell check turn whenever possible one really driving nut lately google doc predictive text cant recall call exactly keep turning wind back action short order
jasonpatterson yeah thats exactly ive ment totally way love automation ask turn
targens sorry peril communicating text assumed making snarky comment bad got back vacation car rented vw atlas nightmare exactly reason wanted control sort thing didnt need controlling wouldnt stay locked near car key instance seemed like massive safety issue also proximity alarm side warned maybe five foot away object including thing like drive throughs stopped along road grab something would alarm chime constantly several thing sort told dont want vw atlas need look really carefully next car buy buying
med student im pretty annoyed doctor peer saying human make decision time reliable computer human make many mistake
mile amazing people k many mile combined meat bag manipulated evidence bodged statistic seem mantra
there thing called train
three waymo vehicle stationary pedestrian cyclistskateboarder ran vehicle face comment stitch
man said say le notice he like uh really man
stationary moment impact doesnt mean autonomous car nothing wrong might tendency pull moving cyclist abrupt emergency stop apparent reason like shopping cart guy cane round corner going safely share road normal car pedestrian cyclist got good predicting theyre likely got drive way mean everyone else predict
joinedupjon hypothetically may possible notice emergency stop came halt case pedestrian crossed front avoid hitting see reason would stopped way unless object avoiding
joinedupjon totally see point study doesnt really show happened abrupt emergency stop dangerous stopping frequent cyclist city learned drive much car around knowing human behind wheel therefore cautious around situation expect car simply drive sometimes human ignorant like see driverless car would need adapt situation feel like learning curve like anything else know driverless car behave like new driver unsure one use driving bike pedestrian
vehicle maybe bike lane crosswalk shouldnt stationary first place yes likely ive seen waymos drive around arizona
imagine hacking network taking control crash car literally accidenting someone
one car today
krank meant remotely yes modern day car onboard chip vulnerable malware car usb drive im already paranoid
faismasterx yes remotely possible since least
krank without installing dongle car please explain
live rural area would worry handle deer road extremely unpredictable also drive speed limit someone always going riding bumper would ai react car lane deer ahead someone accelerating behind happens several time year unrealistic
understanding selfdriving car intelligence requires huge amount data train machine learning algorithm selfdriving car work one area require huge amount data work another area area le common popular likely lack data make car le safe area area different weather condition video sample one area large amount data good weather condition still early day wide spread autonomous vehicle imo
eh still dont like competent control government grows control thing centralize current mainstream big tech disgrace much cow towing fed spook
one interesting idea ive seen regard driving driving human skill exist small period time year give take since first car patent period car period driverless car u today soon possession useless outdated skill
understand machine cant make human error im skeptical selfdriving car wont face problem overcome driver error death program fail receive instruction network fail sensor hardware stop working machine equivalent human paying attention one failure take make difference life death case especially kph factor extreme weather impact tire traction heat affecting circuitry computer etc car still highly dependent different sensor data processing think dangerous imply save world war worth death next century adopting worldwide going long road pun intended troubleshooting mechanical electrical issue vehicle become standard billion people across world mention watching company cut corner put badly programmed vehicle prioritizing profit accessibility giving ammo reactionary technology longterm viable
wonder snow fog especially snow line road covered deal black ice might implement canada lol
sweden norway norway especially lot cliff
people deal snow fog answer youll answer question driverless car
iain windshield wiper defoggers sensorns camera mention differently approach different situation far normal brake steer many variable someone something considered conpetent driver snow ice totally different ballgame cant drive around walking speed safer
megaessin thing invented easily honest really rocket science put pane glass front camera stick windscreen wiper put heating element glass thats car windscreen work moment im saying getting driverless car work snow ice would easy happen ultimately driving question input output even human driver driver use sens provide information need control car combined knowledge car handle rule road right sensor already far advanced eye ear hand advanced enough program computer could easily drive condition human
iain agree im curious would even attempt implement road covered people kind guess road curious see ai would handle people random location random thing actual frame reference like visible road one thing would difficult knowing navigate specific circumstance winter knowing hill icey picking speed hill make build snow knowing need speed youll get stuck could come many scenario see lot stuck driverless car ruining traffic flow winter im assuming ai wouldnt able borderline illegal thing youre required winter avoid stuck
ok like drive car
human driver kill cat dog animal human hopefully tech help prevent killing animal others
think video completely miss important aspect illintentioned behaviour see least two pedestrian may start cross street last moment knowing vehicule stop also mean single person prevent leaving place amusement intention stealattack vehicules way update software network huge amount discovered attack history computer system imagine entity try hard succeed hack update process put modified software best case software could deactivate vehicules demand paralyze country worst case could suddenly block control running vehicules acceleration
aspect definitely looked talked seem quite intuitive flaw definitely wouldnt want take fully automated car ride without possibility driving place people could potentially robkidnapcarjack
funny want driverless car driverless bus probably people see bus something poor people cant afford car taxi think ill stick bicycle travel unless build exercise bike driverless car
car passing lagging real life trippin
im disappointed video uncritically support technology understand optimistic increased safety great increasing dependence car private company design one worst path forward city need completely reimagine city designed transportation network look marginally improving car solution
ive waiting telling naysayer much safer also thinking extra sleep ill work get done movie stream drive could stop driving driverless car today would
scarlett get airplane
think driverless car good idea two reason one accident caused human error would easily prevented computer two road street traffic mathematical series equation calculation rule perfect type task computer handle
lidar wont long term itll optical future elon put best currently drive two camera slow gimbal
yeah mean way limited sight lidar well blind spot
raphaelwaggoner multiple camera thats itll future lidar expensive complicated ultimately unnecessary tesla computer vision well sorted doesnt need point cloud lidar
actual solution would improve public transport railway network get almost benefit cheaper friendly environment sure nice technological feat future transportation afford putting single person car anymore
doesnt scratch futuristic boy toy itch solution right
snowstorm lidar get confused normal thing good percentage people
think thats theyre operating one part arizona environment thing trip car
id like see local cable ferry bet work better person

intuitively make sense ondemand driverless car mean le car sitting around taking space unless change work schedule every region would need volume car necessary work rush hour surge would sit around end workday could definitely optimized carpool system im curious idea
thank goodness still least k people gave narrow minded biased video thumb cover bias far much many perspective topic without mentioning opposite opinion one problem called modern scientist theory like option best balanced opposite theory opinion least vaster democratic consensus reached course entitled opinion thank goodness many opinion counter balance also problem biased funded research shilling industry true science suffers bill get paid accepting payment towards biased industry opinion opinion dont dare ever take away option choose drive control option obligate drive autonomous vehicle choice allowed technology optional well fell safe trusting perfected autonomous vehicle much trusting chauffeur prefer self control driving experience
nice commercial lol would buy one could afford turn travel country
yea burnout
trust bug smash sensor hard water spot build could dangerous
thing im curious security flaw might system vehicle would communicating hub kind seems car operate completely updated information arrive hub could feed false info parked another worry pretty unlikely traffic light dont get hacked often id interested see whats considered security front driverless car
happens someone standing outside front driverless car refusing movea regular driver would get punsh person passenger probably wont even notice theyre phone sleeping
nothing stop people often happen
tell whats gon na happen guy street get text message fine instantly everything surveillance always know
worry loss job transportation industry otherwise im super ready
r cracy dont even want power steering slushboxes crappy thing know traffic going expect crash wont work connected talk others know doo want dont want car sty lain passing middle laft lain hoggers must removed
riding scarlett
maybe would persuasive non sponsored video
eh im sure derek doesnt get sponsored company doesnt support
well data already driverless car le accident per mile human driver thats really need know
kevinuchihaog waymo geofenced city thats almost always clear sunny car support team people say make seem like there driverless taxi take anywhere thats absolutely case car
jake yet theyre still better human give time
fullaccess thats totally misleading statement exact reason stated cant compare average mile driven total population waymo
tech may close here deal affordable look least almost good conventional vehicle get critical mass vehicle economy psychology cant wait idiot stare every broken car road able automated car keep going

big proponent autonomous car worked software development time im ready get hype train bug exploit think something like recent solar wind hack hitting autonomous car fleet handler say telling car fleet take sharp left speed suddenly speed year response seems optimistic yeah move autonomous situation long range highway haul good driving condition everyday runofthemill driving nah year mark probably much
people think cant hit car block car stupide thing
u actually like driving
imagine going back time introducing auto automobile
im wondering car trained specific zone idk driving new york use data algorithm retrained specific zone
meanwhile taxi driver chosen death
like tesla upgraded autopilot would know doesnt respond well challenging condition people let help dont trust full autopiloting chance youd dangerous situation could killed
kinda wish would gone indepth security thing like hey lidar one vehicle isnt going affect lidar another also wonder possible create lidar box another vehicle thatd cause crash know hacking blizzard ever navigated snow storm rain handle snow drift thing great az there little snow fall interesting demo would could navigate around stealth bomber runway
russia saw escalator operator thinking boring job

yes yes yes yesterday slept train powered renewable energy read newspaper followed work email nice conversation fashion designer new york going zurich switzerland saying maybe car completely vanish future probably rethink urban transportation whole
good well really like driving
step closer delamain real
one thought came idea autonomous vehicle really liberating pedestrian whatever hell want malcolm gladwell
dont trust hardware software running done fair share programming electronics know random stuff happens matter good selfdriving code whats going happen power supply loses filter cap blow youre cruising toward bend freeway people suggest redundant power supply happens there problem electonics connect two supply happens often would expect software side thing odd bug often found many year even decade theyre created happens computer home might get crash odd behaviour nobody going seriously hurt killed also little chirp tire parking lot good example whats still wrong made incorrect decision pretty much human driver would make instance wasnt dangerous situation going result slamming brake swerving avoid thing arent actually hazard potentially causing accident saying accident caused another vehicle cyclist pedestrian something stupid isnt automatically someone something wrong there really chance accident exactly situation focusing happens someone else something stupid dangerous think every vehicle road self driving thing would probably safer ideal world without cybercrime mix self driving ordinary human driver varying good awful might dangerous dealing human driver everyday cycle commuter learn recognize human behaviour dont believe computer really trained recognize example driver ahead wandering slightly lane position staying lane moving slightly one side back forth recognize theyre likely distracted messing phone trying send text message car built handsfree gps whatever maybe keep distance case make sudden turn would fault rear end car slam brake last second gps little slow call corner time situation would get believe computer would

veritasium understand self driving car safer u enjoy driving feel like dmv test get driver licence way easy would mind made test regulation significantly difficult u actually want drive also driving steep mountain road bad paint low visibiliy idk self driving car able react montebello road santa clara county would great example road may hard self driving car
self driving car taxi cab back seat difference computer human driving vehicle like donut coffee mug
believe compared cab ive ridden id prefer computer
as id like driver still sense self preservation
picked really bad example plane arent fully autonomous constantly observed pilot plane couldnt land without il cant land airport dont il installed plane lot infrastructure help navigate environment selfdriving car rely almost completelly sens autonomous car cant fix traffic still need lot self driving car get people around peak hour
someone chronic pain cant wait autonomous vehicle give much independence drive many day cant many day get someone pick find way back car feel better friday take uber work one way thats get paid way go urgent care etc car could drive id b able much
hope norm soon possible cant wait
commercial vehicle operator otr would appreciate dont think solve thing driver like driving add large percentage driver including dont know fear selfdriving car unwillingness let something take control something human majority u want control le unless burden whatever relieved beyond personal understanding simply make life easier car already point guess also trust already dont trust much without proof proficiency aside extreme case dont trust anything else another human despite easily swayed ah well hope happens think would big step landing moon opinion
could switch every car autonomous one thing would probably work much better accomodate human behavior
dont think autonomous vehicle inherently bad idea human fallible doesnt excuse rushing implementation logic machine software fallible human make fact autonomous vehicle would work lot inclement weather improperly maintained road automatically push implementation several year human error main cause accident people need held accountable driving influence driving unsafely legislation need figured term bear responsibility two driverless vehicle collide also data human driven car driverless car idea driverless car would make error human would seems really premature arent enough driverless car good sample size happens lidar malfunction happens there issue firmware hasnt updated happens system fail failsafe driverless car someone sitting back slam brake turn car neutral given sponsored video think video inherently biased hand wave reasonable concern people
hey delamain isnt
thanks certain thing ai cant
really think make driverless car idiot proof dont underestimate primal stupidity human major insurance carrier sign let know
honestly worst video youve ever done sorry critical thinking questioning whether company tell true even hint scientific curiosity obvious ok work outside particular city question sponsored content worst sincerely hope pay good allow come back valuable science stuff
clearly wasnt meant video discussing every little detail driverless car yet showcasing enormous potential company isnt claiming car work everywhere would know actually payed attention classification driverless car showed video also mentioned fact specific technology yet road lane line unpredictable infrastructure
sooo ready fully autonomous car
russia dont road sometimes traffic light destroyed often dont think use car country
youre going hit thats quite wager
wonder deal ice snow probably need really good wiper lidar least
technologically great improvement actually improve city create better transportation infrastructure smarter urban planning car automation american solution american problem overreliance car
may curb american solution mass transit easier implement fully autonomous world since route detourbypass wouldnt confusing even noticed
ironically american assumption overreliance car global phenomenon especially country developing recently developed first world nation like china india nigeria car provide quick personal transport whereas new infrastructure require lot time investment government intervention unreliable aforementioned additionally autonomous car reduce traffic make road safer also allow car sharing form public transportation cheaper set train modular bus drastically reduce amount vehicle road later point important developing nation automated preferably green car take place manual car better environment
would autopilot able ditch captain sullenbergers plane hudson
driverless car take straight concentration camp
biggest issue get hacked hijacked someone ill intention could cause car accident wherever wanted computing power side world
mics also work together camera recognize fact emergency vehicle making siren sound see scenario lot driverless car getting trolled jerk siren megaphone
rolled version notrolling patch shortly p
fixed title driverless car company sponsored video think want driverless car road
technology almost herethe problem city infrastructure think flying car sooner self driving car trying drive poorly marked road full pothole bump
living brazil im pretty sure autonomous car long way getting automatic car still widely used year ago ab breaking driver airbags became mandatory car expensive company take advantage fact force u outdated technology still profit market
would interesting car safety system could automated first order avoid accident collision
recent concern fight modern city planning replacing car walking cycling transit
still self driving bus also modern city planning mainly focused removing car dangerous loud pollute expensive maintain road
southwest resident cool michigan resident still waiting even remotely usable snow ice
still plenty done term lidartolidar interference immunity multiple selfdriving car nearby
wondering reference work done area
wonder theyll deal problem hacking
car proberbly heavy encryption might use public internet typical sense worl database even stronger protection incase someone directly access car plus failsafes might baked firmware level almost impervious hacking
lachlanswadling failsafes would make vehicle impervious hacking wouldnt computer cell phone heavy encryption baked decrypting take resource reencrypting must use public internet sense vehicle communicating cell phone tower transmit data would need whole infrastructure data simple solution would make automation data non wireless ex hooking automation computer data keeping call help button separate system way make something impervious remote hacking keep data local could still hacked locally ex someone order ride downloads vehicle firmware reengineering ordering second third ect ride flashing vehicle
lachlanswadling must nice able see emperor clothes say southern u pipeline municipal water supply major global corporation hospital probably strong security encryption im sure
would neat way assassinate people driverless car
ponyfoot doesnt even driverless vehicle ability take control driver risk exploited pretty sure even simple lane assist assisted parking
lidar cool mvis best class
traffic causing ineffective expensive bustrain clip used cgp grey video major issue would pedestrian ever cross street
build walkway
toppro walkway overhead would inconvenient people disability something self driving car supposed help apposed hinder walkway underneath also hotspot mugging simply putting pedestrian uncomfortable situation making area unappealing pedestrian mean driverspassengers self driving car meaning traffic car huge area compared one two passenger inside bus train way efficient self driving car intersection shown would susceptible attack one car hacked swirving traffic could cause huge pile also noise pollution car fill upcharge parking lot obsolete replaced even larger charging station answer traffic diversity transport dont cater car bus train bike pedestrian self driving car bad expensive solution wrong problem
yeah driverless car nice extremely u centric especially phoenix one worst city world autonomous car handle pedestrianized area able work cycling infrastructure able work tram going able respond there pedestrian jumping front bus road isnt wide enough also make car two seat driverless minibus seem make sense economically
wonder theyd like snow ice condition especially snow falling heavily
unless self driving car deliberately bend break rule driving personal gain speed ill let everyone else self driving car ill manual driver abusing vehicle software programmed safety driving rule may move squeeze ahead traffic unless programmed intentionally drive aggressive manner see use come top
attitude reason traffic jam crash occur
matsr yes make push get ahead every man world
brianhginc yes eventualy government legislate new car driverless road legal car driverless
matsr next come hacker manipulating ai drive aggressively enough ai give advantage
love idea self driving car also love driving im torn
public transportation could better though
eye see unlimited distance would hope waymo move image processing redundant camera spatial positioning asap
louise yo check vid sure mean texture human hit deer visual processing issue sure point youre making
wayme isnt yet safer human driver
would freaky first looking forward many instance however always want freedom hit open road control
car self drive india driver careful stick road traffic rule think ai would improve experience dominic torreto level
want driverless car road dont great video keep shitty work
like veritasium hard take video like seriously sponsored company subject video huge conflict interest supposed look educational content reasonable viewer shouldnt trust video ad really unfortunate could made video waymo driverless car unrelated sponsor
like self driving car smart safe something driving shifting gear love driving
think want think
love autonomous driving car however love driving car still drive stick hope always allow responsible human driver drive enjoy like
imagine many elderly people shouldnt driving could remove road finally gpa larry brand new lexus stop merging mph highway mph
imagine many young people cause three time many accident older driver would road
derek nailed head beginning key true level autonomy vehicle onsale currently july offer level autonomy least one call level system fullself driving
video great derek think might misunderstanding poll quite lot people europe usual elevator common uber call think year good estimation
car getting hacked kidnapping people reasonable worry
autonomous vehicle legally required manual stop mechanism demonstrated video
idc driving one simple analog pleasure left controlling authoritarian world
find driving terrifying personally
get many people working driverless car lying come change traffic know need wait year see true sure hope next year dont need get hope high
oil change required lol
id like see car go autonomous mode entering freeway traffic jam people make traffic worse getting selfish constantly changing lane
people le hackable considering lax itsecurity critical infrastructure like electricity getting car country ramp kmh try hit would interesting new arsenal cyberwarfare
car autonomous would traffic jam anymore even jam caused accident roadwork would significantly decreased magnitude bc self driving car would able communicate move perfectly sync
nicolaim lax security electricity wont hurt car though also google tesla pretty stronk security
nicolaim human dosent say steering throttle taken done right lot car today wifi connection
domogdeilig meant cautionary tale tesla already blunder software registering fake stop sign getting confused laser example
dont driver licence disability extremely cool
hope get commute one car one day
wish norm already driving suck
important knowing work know would responsible case accident
good condition easy part handle rain snow missing lane marking
biggest challenge autonomous vehicle face regulation
there thing believe wont driverless car year live switzerland people extremely conservative dont like new stuff especially old people switzerland would vote legalizing autonomous car mainly older people way people even allowed vote young people often dont vote switzerland wheras elder dont really think happen next year would happy wrong
camera many
great uncle hit drunk driver last week driver trying accuse jumping front car everyone car jeered people dont even deserve drive uncle fine btw guy trying pull sidewalk intersection wasnt going fast
hacking type car would interesting video
guess mistake title
think main big question driverless car who fault accident involving car rare case car forced hit somethingsomeone safe security standpoint many tech people notified smart device eg smart speaker smart lightbulb smart fridge often venerability point gain access someone phonecomputer would driverless car company able ensure kind thing safe enough highly unlikely kind failsafe incase kind attack
speeding cause accident suspect best driving slow andor performing excessive lane change speed definitely cause accident
question someone illegally blind
im looking forward future almost non human driven car imagine driving fun drive always zone really drive perfect last part really got amount pollution traffic accident space could saved
agree likely handful year away autonomous driving used think government would main stop sign frankly impressed forward thinking many u state government adoption ultimately think main challenge remain inclement weather especially night heard many auto driving system still great heavy rain snow poor road system area heavy construction old unmaintained road many feature current system rely present ethic patch modern car system almost certainly receive regular update software package yet look modern software company none flawless upgrade history seems inevitable point car receive bad update happens lead bad driving behavior worst case scenario serious flaw could lead widespread accident across entire country take step malicious hacker could generate scenario patch handling major final step assume short term car receive automatic update likely result maintenance period lifecycle performance attrition car lifecycle auto driving equipment inevitably degrade wiring glitch external damage wear tear etc well car function hardware isnt software side never owned car didnt kind software glitch ish year ownership minor context autodriving system start see accident increase glitch accrue time dont think yetbut getting think much faster people give credit think distinct possibility child born year never actually drive car
likely never fully adopted people idea also teach child convince around
car operate camera get muddy figure would big difference arizona place big seasonal change weather would car constantly stop get cleaned solution put system
shame autonomous car wont belong pay monthly subscription drive around im buying
opposed paying monthly car payment monthly insurance payment cheaper pay
cheaper car choice dont need every day one hate car ownership complete money pit designed trap vehicle manufacturing industry encourages planned obsolescence within marketing tolerance move away individual ownership go away well dont get wrong love driving eventually sport
omg thats one nice
think comparison making aviation flawed yes aviaiton highly automated think likely see decrease pilot required future however reason manual landing standard day night simply far efficient operational perspective higher spacing required airport even equipped approach guaranteed safe area atc regarding operational perspective sustained catb il quality minimum seperation aircraft increased significantly talking doubling airport rely visual approach like sfo quadrupling seperation aircraft fly behind even taking account problem big aircraft like causing disruption signal vicinity fear even autopilot take specific job clear well defined car autopilot cant missing human aspect interaction problem solving case plane atc guide long flightplan around obstacle driverless car fear behaviour spaceswhere required like tight road cause many issue think see lot autonomous driving street qualityintensity conflict big regardless quantity like highway physically seperate direction question pulling lane solved fairly easily mathematically plus operate pretty safe space term homogenity participant solving issue single handedly work reasonably good
year driving would love see automated vehicle know lot people say dont trust computerdriven vehicle trust human driver far le point let face people far le reliable computer would best driver world still taken teenager fear death grandad med let get vehicle going within city limit start saving life

yeah bruv lithium mining really good environment
fun game u lane highway doubt work amsterdam bike rider stoned tourist haha
ive wanted driverless car even got license
big hangup pilot much qualified airspace le populated autonomous travel highly predictable road half autonomous half dangerous

interesting thought provoking mechanical failure car know redundancy built car wonder confident mechanical failure could easily lead fatal accident
waymo sponsored video show tesla hitting truck yay
one lv car crash caught video
exactly like huge catalogue level autonomous driving accident caused undue userreliance chose sleeping bonehead behind wheel tesla blame tesla shown context overreliance assisted driving
manager lady scream bad manager vibe
even technology already take year become mainstream first cost ridiculous available wealthy individual year come second average age vehicle around year depending country mean renew fleet least year go since time become affordable middle class
think self driving work best provided every car road self driving manual override way car communicate keep apart speed limit obeyed parking confrontation would avoided car queue stooping going highway
see problem still human designing system writing software also hackable agree average well built machine would better human driver make worst case scenario lot scarier make feel le control le responsible safety put lot trust computer programmer simply dont trust software much especially since one think cyber security nearly much lot question thing adapt unique situation protestors jump street surround vehicle wierd tactic become susceptible design people going exploit thing many variable moment
really missed opportunity say vehicle waymo experience
hi liked video like wouldnt trust life need also think following software always bug happen new update issued specific case cause fail rare happen point time multiple car road using lidar cause interfere car also know sound funny reality happens unexpected external factor big problem handle also im even mentioning security people start hacking taking advantage flow system terrifying really depends willing risk get point b choose put faith system hand viable option see travel low speed good built city highway
kind crazy showed overwhelmingly positive improved statistic much safer automated car truly long period time accident occurred human error yet people commenting even watched video
something expected cry much
dafaq
hell yes absolutely want fully autonomous car hell im looking forward day norm longer concerned maniac road
adam something critiqued cgp grey traffic video undercut video bit think need fully autonomous vehicle want much safer watch adam something video think youll want take step may end favor fully autonomous bus creative idea actually solve heavy traffic create safer road
cat iii landing one thing let computer land aircraft legal reason however especially u basic il instrument approach flown autopilot physical landing done pilot biggest reason plane jet flown u old automatic landing function autopilot system reason see foreign carrier get complacent autopilot come handflying aircraft rusty best see lot airbus pilot especially since heavily automated faa requires pilot certain level proficiency come flying airplane order keep getting rusty fly plane hard stuff like takeoff land well kick autopilot feel like though nearing cruise climbout never takeoff land
felt like multiple misleading thing video
opliko felt quite disappointed first time really well bet episode felt like mr beast think youtube getting better
yep end day automated system still assistance tool still pilot flight deck still human staffing tower tracon center lot people also dont seem understand autopilot actually pretty dumb almost plane theyll happily fly full stall plane fly mountain ignore terrain warning move control surface hold whatever heading altitude set plane autothrottles adjust throttle maintain set airspeed human air traffic controller one keep pilot whether hand flying running autopilot running terrain plane there also huge difference controlling plane maintain minimum mile horizontal foot vertical separation controlling car driving foot unpredictable driver pedestrian elevator analogy also worst comparison ive ever heard closedsystem single vehicle know stop easily achieved redundant sensor floor failure sensor also catastrophic
dont think driverless car bad never hear anyone talk workforce tech replace undoubtedly adopted across multiple industry
million going lose job sure new job arise nothing match loss even job lost indirectly purchasing power people get low company cant sell soon company go bankruptcy chain reaction start even job business lost
taxi driver mad uber driver stealing jobsnow imagine uber driver taxi driver together mad stealing job bigger challenge driverless car society make politician union let technology progress society remember folk human need apply job nextautomation coming u alland welcome transport overlord
lidar signal source impact van instance another one autonomous van driving next van would get false reading vehicle deal interference notwell thats cool
people average remaining really bad driver median however
fun untill evil hacker arrives
anyone thought maybe mass amount people dying due car accident good thing
cant wait see many bad driver almost every time take car denmark supposedly better end driver im inclined disbelieve tbh often see people still argue thing like speeding good idea using misconception manipulation mean faster get self driving car better
although selfdriving car reality u dont see coming soon europe road complex driver arguably lot better furthermore constriction safety making harder implement furthermore think easily said incident unlikely happen obviously happen eventually although maybe often however incident give rise interesting question example responsible accident netherlands accident car bicycle happen almost always car fault since bicycle vulnerable bicycle get hit selfdriving car something unexpected responsible person car company making car
plot twist car driven remotelylol still quite mesmerizing though see future making
problem thing made china camera one real fake made cheap plastic access menu need give card info social number
surely driverless car work properly human driver removed equation car network mesh relaying data positioning etc
car getting hacked safely driving owner kidnapper
derek im going report back ride go feel review right paid one think potentially shady derek telling u safe brings million death people dont use selfdriving car video paid make selfdriving car company think there huge potential conflict interest shame dont know much trust he saying important topic even think direct sponsorship big deal point make questionable everything emotional appeal death insinuation car prevent title trying really hard sway safety info sourced company make thing thats bit questionable shall say
maybe research get point
spaghetti course research im saying information topic contained within one video topic could presented fair way doesnt seem questionable
jakobvanklinken agreed
youve got aviation bit simplified wrong research
criminal know rob everyone inside blast siren sound vehicle pull keep siren going car go way easy
actually easy see person away think u agree
driver professionally u skill needed safe driving simply dont exist general public would prefer better driver education automation realistically time consuming
also dude identifies time labor strike led automating labor existence see good thing lol
think actually advocate le car city general public transportation essentially already developed selfdriving vehicle many people
ah yes sponsored video surely nonbiased content
good point matter much trust channel keep mind video sponsored could conflict interest
thing non biased thing made human possible doesnt mean untrue
kingifrit catch human caused accident penalize someone autonomous crash nobody penalized incentive remove
sweepsweep company made car software engineer
kingifrit yeah case bias towards company whose interest selling product repay investor never invested unworkable venture
gah fully autonomous car future sure well wont waymo great system way expensive specific certain city
everyone us lidar wont interfere
id hope theyre using different frequency
fully autonomous vehicle would mean world someone cant drive probably never would able buy car go anywhere wanted
yet another way monitor human population
want loose weight
clearly doesnt understand enough automation aviation plenty time automation disconnected wrong thing
yes boeing proved always manual override
g network better network fully implemented meaning internet respond time infinitely approaching extremely low latency vehicle connected one network kind low latency possible crash vehicle fact g coming soon
point ive seen many video spanish dub feel odd hear derek voice
since september owned vehicle since july driven le mile rental car training class far away day retired owning car help survive nice neighborhood soc sec retirement income vehicle way mo experience human driver veritasium guy miss lety smart chick hot
important question see one featured pornhub decked electric toy waymo get cut
person many responsibility creating adjusting process work see biggest challenge able fill computer automated car anything else really enough yet reasonable data computer know every possible situation programmer dont tell computer cant know machine learning already work still beginning car automation opinion love evolving truly believe full automation improve safety efficiency traffic still way go
happens lidar fails
going prove someone driving car fully responsible generated accident driver blame ai trying lie even though would data recorded data tampered form monitoring via wireless network could done third part level also connection tampered
know tesla driving autopilot year right yes car phone home tell wether auto pilot crashed also send footage sensor data
hepphepps thank blind tesla fanatic fyi tesla right level whereas level video car least level nobody monitor driving please return sandpit instead answering serious question pathetic sarcasm far relevant truth thank kid
thesharcrash tesla level production car quite time however legal limitation level country except project waymo even year old hyundai level really bearing original question question ap usage crash come numerous time legality might become challenging level rather limited still need legally responsible human designated trip certified sober awake probably seated left front seat lot lot interesting case aviation world responsibility cross pilot command airline representative manufacturer designer automated system involved accident question data integrity likewise come aircraftworld famously early air france also tesla driver blame auto pilot right foot got heavy opted comment tube video rather watching road even accepting full legal responisibility enabling auto pilot integrity data never really put question reviewed court easiest document fraud would hard manipulate data way wouldnt contradict evidence pulled potential source dash cam witness surveillance cam damage car vehicle also intercar comunication developed itsvanetivc type vvsolutionsso within year car would comunicated quite lot data status nearby vehicle pulled used evidence would potentially damage manufacturer oblivion caught tampering data easier make good autonomous system first place
youre jonny cab opened door got hellava day isnt
weather condition
reservation potential safety autonomous vehicle many reservation who legally responsible vehicle hurt legal system insurance industry handle accident person driver seat start kitt thing get bit hazy who paying hospital bill
question isnt safe exploitable impact people job would choose protect driver pedestrian blindly walk onto road hacked also driverless car doesnt mean driverless motorbike cyclist right human error still occur road know car react impact people make living taxi driver delivery driver trucker car even affordable people becoming worse driver speak country one safest road world car accident stayed roughly last year
software engineer something make doubt much future transportation would ride fully autonomous car sure welldefined motorway intersection pedestrian bicycle full surveillance system would backyard road countryside native italy million year thing could go wrong instantly software many
driverless car purpose rick drive gather intelligence law enforcement driverless car oh god rick welcome club pal
video confirmed people realistic idea long technology take implement wont ever try new stuff
fool climbing mount everest stop plug zone live electric dream
million mile worth year driving yet couldnt avoid car move wrong side road hope fix
great video interesting love stuff calculation wrong vehicle experience stated average driver driver ai never match id love one vehicle try handle minneapolis winter rushhour
derek think youve missed fundamental point ethical ai point motorbike scenario rare circumstance therefore shouldnt stop deployment autonomous driving million death dont happen meet scenario point make programming choice decide risk based decision making car make death decides necessary endless issue cause liability happens family sue company killing loved one
tech ethic professor go realistic trolley problem driverless vehicle exploitable vulnerability could get understand dont matter long car suck driving le human opinion ideally car would driverless connected knowing time issue would watching pedestrian even traffic could reduced limiting number vehicle taking path
honestly disappointing video showing cool technology pure corporate advertisement minute insulting audience want make science education video need balanced actually inform viewer strength weakness technology still rd ask critical question interview dont problem working company lose creative freedom hit company talking point
yeah driverless car dont need paycheck health insurance k bravo making world shittier place
im afraid driverless car wait finally come video look somewhat onesided far waymos progress slower claimed would seems trouble moving phenix suburb never snow barely ever rain guess issue driverless car solve good human would like see video issue instead repeating already said multiple time
guess issue driverless car solve good human kind phrase usually dont hold ten year regarding rain snow suspect data problem car never drive rain also never acquire data driving rain go snow solve need actually put car kind situation even mean using human driver simply drive car passively collect data
yeah there driving seat one seat whatever want case notice something odd drive
theory car equipped like one video enough training outsafety human earth human probably race better matter time software able handle situation throw honest uncovered scenario default hit brake faster reaction time living creature earth probably going fine compared u
sensor see dark rain would never speed snow rain
olot thats manufacturer driverless care competent look rafael vasquez case uber autonomous vehicle killed pedestrian phoenix arizona veritasium riding around due everyone involved completely incompetent
im cant wait category get way better u solid object clear twolane urban street big highway seem like simple stuff kind binary drive narrow wiggly country lane isnt even two vehicle wide judge far safely nudge softbutphysical hedge get past oncoming vehicle safely back parking place passed twenty yard back clocked big enough need remembered passing cant still worse many urban driver ive met tourist lane around lived going one day rather handy driverless urban taxi need able thing reliably like competent local driver test drive condition im genuinely keen see handle never see put test video
sadly dont think high tech gadget would efficient celcius winter season
seeing aggressively people counter steer thing get dicey id bet could teach neural network whole heck lot better human
yes yet tesla amongst sold car country norway every grandmother aunt driving mid winter autopilot icy back road done year already
hoping well trust human driver concern programming recognizing thing like bicycle walker etc
year experience traffic experience zero experience snow ice condition
yes human fallible program written human dont human shame derek
driver john cena
cant wait till thing
bad thing le freedom mean many state essentially live cyberpunk dystopia worse seen movie park kars home
mean realistically car vehicle social status thing auto pilot still get destination like pilot cessna need fly somewhere wan na drive car manually sure prove drunk stupid fully concentrated time driving point might wan na av relax driving concentrate constantly
mrbartt add social credit forbidden travelling sf author predict flying car cessna people cheaper cheaper road park people go faster mean le control government technology make cheap safe flight like gyrocopters know gyrocopters one useful military really long distance like aircraft vertically land time minor modification lift vertically safer aircraft much safer helicopter social status want cheap private way move controlled big corporation government stupid
bykvuk wan na cheap way use train subway way add big amount monkey behind personal vehicle increase risk drastically vehicle fly top people thats even worse cheaper cost exist safety expense
mrbartt gyiro safe absolute safety safety always collision security train private controlled freedom train like track omg train track read dont understand half written
ai drive road andes bolivia himalayan road ice highway canada without incident driverless car nothing gimmick
blame people killed passenger car maker car
car maker obviously passenger control fault car fault car maker
yea fully expect year old daughter never need learn drive hell next car could fully autonomous one rent like uberlift vehicle dont need
would buying car
twat
would say limiting factor autonomous car infrastructure thats may take year operable country poorer infrastricture need rebuild
yes agreed maybe even longer
driven tesla advanced autopilot wintery norwegian back road pretty much problem really problem
hepphepps still fail point human made blind faith human tech foolish dangerous
danielmurray blind faith would stupid statistic system learned enough mistake le frequently human known statistical analysis mature system rest pr lobbying regulation changed far point time road system course limit kind road travel autonomously beginning car know
hepphepps wont let thing drive help sure full yes itll take year year probably yr actually relatively fast yes said itll still fail long human earth well accident death related vehicle tech life people need accept
car never work india
honestly cant wait nice little auto auto lined neatly right lane pas left
fact
wont give wheel robot
seems issue want solve driverless car general traffic could solved combination better public transport infrastructure short distance drive autonomous otherwise perhaps short term hire vehicle think like hierarchy distance planeboattrain train bustube carbicycle walk longer shorter distance network route however short distance drive far likely situation autonomous vehicle work poorly countryside road small village woodland dirt path driveway frequently poorly maintained area ideal world focused economically ecologically sustainable public transport infrastructure use case autonomous vehicle drop dramatically may become useful local public transport plane train bus tram already investing heavily automation fascination techminded people personal autonomous vehicle seems like distraction solution could make realworld impact reducing traffic density reduces danger completely different level removing human dependency always seemed like smokescreen big business interest want continue selling car moving towards monopoly ownership road natural extension jaywalking law u example cool smokescreen impressive technology make say wow human innovative creative think plenty incredible individual working project great moral personal reason lack substance term ratio effort net effect option provide
wont need dangerous window fly anymore well inside computer screen bubble
nothing happy
waymo fare credit please sue dickhead car accelerates crash wall waymo hope enjoyed ride car explodes
driverless car purpose rick drive gather intelligence law enforcement driverless car oh god rick welcome club pal
everyone sitting selfdriving car sound lot like train bus bad urban area environment
came comment looking someone said already
main problem see responsability pay case crash even reduce number crash human error still death year people gon na accept number compare elevator death year
isnt argument driverless car much argument available useful mass transit
ever seen bus train seem like solution bad traffic city driverless car
able order driverless car pick
im poor aford one
im wondering long time ill able reach place without driving car im excited someday fully autonomous car
naruto shadow clone justu training technique
always thought dumb dangerous drive forward onto driveway backup onto road statistic mentioned video still wonder many american way
phoenix lol road condition boston
fair perfectly mathematically possible people actually average driver
exciting stuff
question put human driver two potential accidental crash motorcyclist one helmet one without human choose avoid would choose avoid
drift equity answer
college student worst walking side stopped car personally witnessed car least people badly injuring running side stopped car time downtown near university luckily broken nose phone common injury
perform mountain
watching tesla crash recommendation
able expirience driving game becomes thing
might thing shakiness video youre holding camera hard watch jarring uncomfortable especially car
waymo still struggle left turn ultimately tesla win market autonomy road instead walled environment tesla approach machine learning one using v big data unfortunate theyre one
cost impact total vehicle cost removing driver interface component ai driving wont speed need horse power etc
guy proven time time good little muppet cute lil guy cant wait see sing along elmo cookie monster grover
sooned vehicle autonomous sooner get rid accident well except someone running stationary car guess still accidental also stupidity ive seen cyclist using phone driving example
dont want becouse lot ppl living
cost rare earth needed new toy rich people
seasonal country like cant drive winter half line disappear whats point dirt road handle
much vehicle dont trust implementation company google bit known data hoarding problem tesla seems mind allow people fix vehicle
want type car tested indian road
ironically main problem india country bad trafficking av
car would stop start cry would burst flame
would think inside cow pasture
talking national high way city road talking national highway sorry say high quality
mean thatd ai cruelty already human cruelty trying drive thing terrifying dont scare easily visited year ago gripping seat white knuckle passenger decided ever driving road would impossible
overwhelming need computer run every single aspect life getting bit old frankly disturbing extreme unspoken truth someone control movement cede control movement system really want level personal oversight time think one thing use elevator travel building without human agent help get destination quite another remove freedom independent movement
whats mentioned two type selfdriving system development major difference waymo system tesla system waymo car drive premapped road tesla vision system car drive anywhere plunk done right visiononly system tesla superior lidarradar system like waymo plus tesla full self driving system billion mile real world driving use teach system ai big difference waymos simulation unbiased autonomous driving expert agree tesla autonomous driving race even though waymo fleet selfdriving car road oh video doesnt mention every waymo car there human monitoring drive ready hit remote controlled brake operator surrounded monitor show feed camera sorta like there someone driver seat even though passenger doesnt see guess waymo didnt want fact known
money like bring technology philippine
level automation subaru love cant wait see advanced automation car
gose million job people going earn future specially low skilled worker
think absolutely inhumane barbaric car drive much senseless death reason whatsoever car today extremely outdated technology thats like modern hospital using bloodletting treat cancer patient
cant wait driverless car speak imagine efficiency
program common sense country cross last second yellow unwritten rule everyone follows imagine self driving car instant stop instead like thats guaranteed accident reason car accident somebody crashing show high possibly car abruptly stopped unexpected manner another example two kid staying near pedestrian cross gon na cross wait something self driving car read bored facial expression understand human body language based believe also im sure never possible use autopilot see specifically prepared road highway never city unless every single car road autonomous also billion km perfect californian road waste time make baby run india one day without accident maybe trust
legal liability insurance aspect thatll need sorted especially car owned individual maintain keeping camera clean example
going eula every piece software youve ever used waymo assumes liability whatsoever circumstance regarding use software includes limited loss life financial damage reputational social mental damage might occur use software software provided without expressed implied warranty function merchantability fitness particular purpose
andersjjensen imagine failed update bricking car suppose happen though onboard tech engine management
frostspike let mechanic update software brick fix p
andersjjensen yep overtheair update id worried suppose itd possible turn manually people wouldnt point car would probably refuse run old softwarefirmware release theyd something insurance policy said uptodate release covered
carbon footprint ai autonomous car huge probably wont viable solution care long term planet
lot smaller everyone need car also dont gas powered
im totally fine automatic car please ban manual driving like one allowed drive leave far safer option
would love see technology handle snow
long little snow live edmonton month year road winter nightmare residential street thick pack snowice inch street last year end add particularly heavy snowfall add wet snow condition ice sensor add black ice thin clear dont know another level technology needed condition like tech see snow ice tech label road lane without visual line sight better tire braking icy street said human driving condition suck sort sensor probably safer already likely slow
guess thats theyre arizona lmao
ya definitely different beast stuff like lidar sensor still see even heavy snow im canada keep thinking every winter car backup camera unusable wonder could solve someone like keep camera clean warming lens something
handled snow moving away ohio snowfree climate
alexwebster think le visibility question making many small bespoke adjustment environment demand constant random adaptation kind thing hard part driving snow rain arent really familiar le visibility road condition
nice well neve italy reason dont uber taxi driver somehow bully politician
would neat see future kid shock driver license car bit stunned learn elevator driver mean wth
danger lidar human eye wont laser damage eye
cant see beam cant damage eye
game change put trailer
im old enough remember headless horseman autonomous drive ahead time
robot still better game people need time
megatheinternet didnt think ai could beat master chess didnt think ai would ever beat master go
maybe silly question avoid different autonomous vehicle tripping others lidar
maybe unique frequency send
crazy time alive really hope reach year goal
impressive extremely u centric wide road clear intersection ramp think driverless car integrate trickier infrastructure different driving style culture example mediterranean country pull front moving traffic force leave gap otherwise youre never getting anywhere uk youre zooming country lane barely wider car scanning hedgerow deer remembering last passing place case need reverse tractor doable require lot work truly roll everywhere
think idea self driving car solution issue much wrong car self driving still way way way le efficient group solution like bus especially train tram best case scenario youd small amount self driving tax traffic handled self driving human driven public transport
wouldnt call fully autonomous
elliot lila yes want even place high emphasis mode travel bicycle public transit still car like application car genuinely highly practical option let away making everything carcentric let throw entirely alright
malcom got script
there one thing last year shown people lack proper decision making skill id rather trust computer antivax idiot someone similar brain
claim million people killed road every year actual statistic cdc killed traffic accident u
worldwide id imagine
problem human better driving people make many mistake thats sure problem accountability something happens responsible please dont say nothing ever happen thats like people said titanic unsinkable
somebody hacked system caused passenger die safe enough avoid hacker
arent computer controlled plane hacked theyre connected internet
assuming doesnt need connected internet perform actual driving function seems like come running simulation based data getting camera rather sort wifi cell signal potential way hack would sort physical exploit within car would simple physically preventing passenger accessing important equipment
sponsorship imply unhappy experience would able publish video would still published sponsorship
veritasium really clarify stand wouldnt trust video ad
couldnt drive driverless car crowd people also advantage
driverless car wonderfulfor people would rather playing smartphone actually paying attention driving
yeah like car go vroom change gear like im connected driveshaft driverless car gon na suck soul transportation
crash clearly see phone driver hand love car driving im totally ready autonomous vehicle majority town trip hopefully would also make safer bicycle motorcycle
question car treat unpaved road road sizeable pothole construction possible detour want know car incapable cause saw plus highly doubt flawless
speed never reason accident parameter allowslimits le time react please stop using speed cause accident
would really interested see waymo system reacts bad weather especially condition like heavy windsrain falling tree flying debris etc would know avoid going road tornado pas would able use service condition like know theyre still working rolling going experience every single type situation yet wonder company approach havent already
obviously also force stop button mentioned earlier video didnt factor think still interesting thought
wonder car deal vantablack object
cool video derek amazing technology dont think take away liberty eventually
great technology narrowest circumstance snow sand paved clearly marked well maintained road handle random event like traffic accident people directing traffic plastic bag tumbleweed blowing around clear really still long way
would still add manual override feature either way since god know happen
god asleep wheel minute
know morbid natural selection mean world populated year automation defeat natural selection world population
future great jewish upper class protected wall barbed wire everyone live chinese empire electricity could free fusion solar peasant get minimum crypto per month buy food video game
look like one worst office space ive seen
think shouldnt skip step highly automated driving car aim automatic car take another year dont want able drive foolproof anglosaxon street system checker come europe try drive giant roundabout arcdetriumphe paris try find way narrow street old city rural spain try drive construction site heavy rain without visible street line common even german autobahn need step step fast
car sound like industrial fan loud curious
hmmmmm interesting still though method slow expand need map geofence whole area let alone aim world also need road well maintain wellmarked road reality gg hahahahhah gg road marking world hahahahhahha great enormous task accomplish believe tech kind system take long time expand fully realized
love technology love self driving car dont trust yet problem system also adoption road memtion hacker use kill people remotely
hate idea fully autonomous driving enjoy driving dont want car drive bugger one day decides enough leaf life men deal girlfriend wife kid computer stuff already full sh autonomous vehicle say f soon men nothing left need autonomous lover spouse im sure make guy like derek happy
would preferred non sponsored video issue car think may able cover
capitalism finest lol wan na work way way back something fun sleep yeah
people monitor ride progress kinda sound like human driver seat autonomous claim
one person monitor multiple ride though
nizart one one either event must admit autonomous
markvwood car drive could go without monitoring people would trust le
driver retarded welcome world automation
considering victim car accident every year wait use technology daily
million people killed road really noone else blame nope plenty people blame like lobbyist politician city planner make impossible people live life without car bigger implication achievable tech already achievable existing proven technology design city way enables walking cycling public transport
landing airplane done pilot ive sat cockpit hundred time never seen autolanding dont want people scared pilot flying
auto landing capability since late
ive experienced one landing would wish pilot used computer gizmo slammed thing hard ground chipped tooth got plane noticed wasnt even windy anything
matter time car hacked tasked kill passenger innocent civilian technology already exists scary future ahead
seoul sit road could see driver car pas would appalled number people cellphone suspect true lot place autonomous car alter traffic pattern better likely save many many life injury happen insurance company person soul give flying hooptie something consider work automotive insurance
dimensional motion didnt realize elevator spin spot haha
know line point n
webentwicklungmitrobinspan guess ya could interpret way mean dot line thing dimensional motion sound like refers spin turn momentum moment travel across point sometimes dimensional motion turn travel momentum dimensional motion mean could rise fall ontop rest admittedly wasnt taught figure make lot sense inactive singular point dimension nothing happening active point dimensional turning occur regardless fast long spin doesnt move dimensional effect regard interact environment like motor climbing required dimension need dimensional axle ensure dimensional conveyor perpetuate another axle thats smaller axle dimensional motion car mean havent exactly achieved true nd rd th dimensional motion considering methodology seem use lesser dimension mimic higher dimension require kinda poetic really
derek managed make one human error could make didnt untwist seatbelt
im worried tech fail youre doomed
nah tech fails car pull stop waymo car actually second fully autonomous backup system dedicated one thing safely pull stop system requires external network communication rely highresolution map us onboard sensor data camera lidar etc literally serf single purpose pull car safely failure detected
freedom come risk danger unwanted death better freedom driverless car cant deal emergency crazy people trying hurt person immediately decide break rule get safety charge freedom behind wheel better freedom behind wheel put responsibility individual worth risk freedom sake ill never drive driverless car unwilling give away freedom currently law would try force driverless car tyranny
make video comma ai
million computerhumen learns much faster computer learns banana using imagehuman one
software dev hard time trusting software
agree bugle software exist bug kind software avenue potential catastrophe either due negligence vulnerability could exploited malicious party granted human bug make mistake much higher rate centralized aspect every car using software amplifies effect bug failure security vulnerability
lardbucket true regular car also centralised issue manufactured designed perfectly
lardbucket bug found fixed though longer issue thats case human driver even individual learn improve skill collective keep making mistake question whether software work perfectly time question whether better human driver every time go car youre relying skill everyone else road including drunk people havent slept aggressive twat performance car old driver shouldnt road anymore young inexperienced driver etc cant wait driverless car
kind measure taken avoid kind cyber attack
think new self driving car orwellian spyingdatacollector device drive destination
already theyre called cell phone
car responds siren xd bro people would definitely play fake siren blasting radio troll haha
context driverless car actually encourage advancement however concern someone driven year find sometimes run position smart vehicle wouldnt able handle like accident blocking entire road local police u go road foot go around
traffic might get little better human make mistake scared merge machine would able precisely
eventually pedal shift steering wheel driving thing past people look back aghast used operate car
making autonomous vehicle communicate real time big step clearly show people dont trust yet non autonomous vehicle disadvantage
heard near future another chauffeurdriver insert vehicle operator service lost job besides try nice meaningful convo thing well without use phone good luck human
car accident leading cause death yall wan na remove human conscious factor prevents number higher could dont mean
hope driverless vehicle coming soon computer better keeping concentration repetitive task like drive car said major hindrance responsibility disclosure trust vehicle party responsible operating case waymo take full responsibility accident occur must stimula place prevent convinced currently case
cool yes technology driverless car software need improving still think year away adopted society third world country probs way difficult even
dont get obsession self driving car like driving go long drive fun
hint life dont get tech exists probably invented likely invented someone disability case public transport shared rideshared car service driving fun really opinion hence ok
want robust public transport infrastructure
lot noise working environment cant good worker day day
car look ugly
lol wendover trash
sure would downside ifwhen becomes norm would make u bit helpless since le experience driving driving license would become relic past
yeah might happen like people dont know ride horse people past
oh think technology implementation infrastructure legal hurdle make large scale implementation
curious see fully automated vehicle drive night
wouldnt much different daytime since use lidar
problem complexity system add component component something likely fail especially company planned obsolesces
yeah noticed real question car ai driven would le total death injury objectively better
invension auto transmission mind transmission repair second costly repair engine repair
future people car drive dont want live future
give free give dearth im pretty sure didnt want boeing max minor update minor didnt even tell pilot angle attack refers relative angle airflow airplane orientation technology isnt freedom go somewhere without anyone knowing give freedom pick everything leave without ex know forget land second chance u leave everything behind may work china freedom movement unmolested big brother tell youre allowed go dont say didnt tell
want driverless vehicle coordinate vehicle actually need driverless vehicle drift go really fast coordinate vehicle meet goal
imagine car good enough drive right country forcing quick transition driverless car million people truck bus taxi driver lose job really low iq study show truck driver average iq u around skill driving rightly demand job living cant really find many job unskilled people going happen serious problem solution
welltodo flat interspecifically concentrate peony microregionally work terrible south america living fanatical swiss
would love driverless car place problem day love driving dont money paying every ride take get mcds go get milk visit family friend
dude convinced selfdriving car great
shame uncrticial given sponsor would loved know rider data processedstored privacysecurity well questioning idea one company monopolising technology surely lifesaving want every car maker
company level autonomy take tesla example agree shame video sponsored though would love see slightly critical view
think technology far monopolized car maker working self driving capacity inevitable one beat others punch eventually others catch
spipsdew safety component car standardised ensure evaluated regardless car maker get harder powered proprietary algorithm black box industry best interest share tech car capability equal footing come kind safety feature
there ton company kind stuff dozen top head im sure ton havent heard id definitely love company could pool data benefit everyone id imagine driving data kept research testing linked individual im sure read site yeah feel quite onesided though im sure thats sponsor issue pretty onesided there lot evidence suggest selfdriving car benefit theyre really widely tested enough show flaw talked flaw thing like place horrible drive case incredibly rare thing wont affect people stuff like poor weather condition car havent tested yet tech still new restricted dont think id want road globally today think limited testing specific area definitely allowed think year two well lot data work lot experience work doesnt technology really
jedikv algorithm probably something even engineer dont know thats twisty thing machine learning
driving part experience
could interesting connect driverless vehicle creating kind driverless web sharing information make safer driverless vehicle around
hope get mandatory law always drive self autonomous car imagine life would live wasnt accident traffic
goonnna fully safe vehicle autonomous
absolutely nerd take bus train insted point aknowledge self narcissit personality
im curious hear security aspect driverless car
introduction automated car history manually driven car
itd like lift video
im curious know saboteur repaint line road could possibly redirect vehicle go somewhere shouldnt like friggin river
following road line thats far simplistic
want free public transport
car would come sooner hate driving traffic dealing unsafe driver every morning
derek make future prediction maybe government road automobile car hmm
negetive side human lazy
human error cause accident error impossible machine make didnt mention human error swhw development appropriate measurement discussion comparing human error driving imho stating machine error impossible machine make kind bold little misinforming think
would like know much one car
brink able afford driverless car unable afford insurance drive
wont driverless car car ride share basis massive garage full youll request one pick take somewhere
itll like uber locality turn road toll road everyone behind car company pay company run car say hat price isnt fault make end meet perpetual lock start one afford travel game take autonomy away
cheer
wonder happens mean terrible driver swerving speeding slowing random like whick prediction use issue escape danger
delamain service beep beep
wonder difference video would wasnt sponsored waymo
tested icy road yet place snowyicy winter id like know handle sudden loss traction
get basic ironed id suppose much better human reaction time computer nanosecond hundred millisecond
andersjjensen true still wouldnt great rural area ive seen raised road back home drifted snow point couldnt tell turning id drive slowly actually feel tire went pavement could correct back road
large sensor suite lidar camera gps radar huuuge amount og cummulative fleetwide ai learning really big deal
hepphepps im concerned city use reported google map issue home town trying find driving distance two point home town population le gave km trip got back said deeper issue would take time address robot car term thats km drive cover minute walk wont take account gps foot kilter snow drift concern would enough drop road
adrianparsons selecting right route course still le optimal thing going apps ever noticed fast gotten better last year insane development precision combine gps beidou glonass gallileo qszz several parallell system plus phone instance car inertial system ai knowing road look without snow car already driven including lidar camera radar vv data car ahead road would put shame airplane done autolands since already first system still year ago throw random noise system plane equipped landed precise location heathrow making hole runway specific spot single radio guided system
ive always pro autonomous car one thing concerned well maybe concerned still one question assuming autonomous car became standard might hundred thousand lidar effect human animal problem water sonar initially didnt think might affect ecosystem ended changing possible exposed laser might damage certain specie mean sure sonar emmits sound wave instead laser two different thing thats im asking
really good thanks
time come eliminate parking lot add green space city yeah thing already public transport bike
terminal carbrain person
voxelfusion rather widespread condition
ill pas driving one freedom
someone doesnt licence trouble motivated work get learner licence cant wait
speaking lidar wouldnt autonomous car road disrupt eachothers dataimage recieves nifty way filter wave reflection wave shot another car
autonomous car better human yea get rid perfectly traced roadlines crubles apart
quite true asiana wasnt manual thrust autothrottle went hold becuase used flight level change mode awareness fault
driverless car really cool invention though agree adam somethings reply cgp grey video one
personally think also people general driver trust ability someone else driving carin case computer often seen driver feel safe behind wheel rather backseat
im one people find prospect terrifying early adopter always far optimistic tech like get eventually lot people buying actually par automatic transmission chess engine take decade tech overcome skilled human even tech get point actually better good human driver tech still fail time average person put time inspection maintenance average airline lot feature great new car suck year line youre buying beater represents another potential point failure car year old computer crash time month leaving stuck without audio climate control playing half second loop whatever music playing whatever volume minute finally reboots thats irritating asshole puckering way computer crash would computer responsible steering acceleration think automated system youve dealt selfcheckouts webites honestly say never issue system shitting bed going haywire
cool guy u really need reduce car plane usage overall sustainable also electric car
issue idea computer driving car easy computer control vehicle much better people issue computer predict idiot driving around even issue predicting sometimes
cant wait one u imagine private taxi build bed basicly becomes driving bed room waking parking barnight cant wait become normal thing
wonder policeman asian country extort lunch money future
feel kinda weird training ai vehicle much detail drive road made human every car like lot rule stop making sense like traffic light stop priority car right maybe even roundabout
driverless driver seat seatbelt
reupload im certain ive seen video oo
autonomous car see incident massive fail security point question happen point may software error update inexperienced competitor starting production understood technology yet cutting cost leading unforseen consequence imagine sensor giving wrong signal redundancy cut budget car big question wil lbe society treat fails held responsible would done kind mistake repeated already saw thing like autonomous car like one driving right wildfire since decetcion heat example given video car driving full speed flipped ambulance software since flipped car facing crosswise self driving car decided would possible highway car would bridge since learned likely situation scan car crossway highway think everyone u seen tech failing may navigation unit commanding drive though newly build train station since operated obsolete map may computer able detect usbdevice replugged time leaving wondering couldnt first time around may online merchand decided invested new vaccuum cleaner best advertisement next whole year would ad vaccuum cleaner case want build army vaccuum cleaner home would feel safe driving fully autonomous car would want still able take neccessary yes may driver start trust car wouldnt take anyways needed least would decision like potential technology could bring yes
cyclist attracts driverless car wont get road rage try kill
another question selfdriving car safe pedestrian cyclist become arrogant reckless something got neil degrasse tyson startalk
pedestrian cross road solution traffic complete disaster everyone outside car
simple walkway road
toppro thats fun game human driver come along
mrroyalchicken mean even light would efficient driverless car
believe speak autonomous car without mentioning teasla
feel sorry police officer plant drug passenger theyre camera
autonomous vehicle work long city designed car people imagine properly built city meaning one built people lot pedestrian cyclist public transport infrastructure becomes harder vehicle respond human time possible advantage autonomous vehicle diminish soon reliable fast bus tram metro system avialable bus already practically selfdriving passenger way wider adoption autonomous vehicle hinders change city design necessary car dependent place answer traffic problem reliable public transport bicycle infrastructure
would like driverless car way many idiot road country im pretty sure current ai prepared also road narrower full pothole may problem self driving car least year away western invention
problem still wait almost u use driverless car make driverless car really safe use like airplane car manual control plus ai useful ai without manual override world still dominated manual driver dont really see much safer read comment agree maybe tech useful big city people sense driving ethicsmorale could say developed country motorcycle buzzing around would say really take long time implement tech mention govt bureaucracy
even choice scenario le scenario car go automated car company still need figure mean imagine autonomous vehicle hit another vehicle people autonomous vehicle wouldntor least shouldnt held accountable accident car manufacturer become really expensive amazingly quickly
agree big city become reality next yr india think gon na take yr
much ride btw didnt say guess fixed cost make driving route getting around block equivalent term money atm
imagine car get road automatically report anyone see speeding would probably noticeable reduce speeding people keep getting charged without able tell camera spotting
well u pesky th amendment would prevent thing
michaeltorrisi dont live usa looked also looked speeding criminal offense u say isnt case correct wrong sixth ammendment wouldnt apply since person fined wouldnt criminal defendant think gave impression since said charged likely interpreted criminal charge rather fined meant like bank account charged since lose money wording bit confusing overall usa us speed camera fine people speed theoretically camera self driving car could utilised purpose
huonsmith attorney could wrong case brought court either going civil case criminal case civil case offense individual wrongful death case civil case criminal case offense state murder case criminal case speeding generally forfeiture offense opposed jailable offense still criminal matter violation law red light camera arent detect speeding theyre detect someone running red light youve got photographic evidence person intersection light red case accuser officer reviewed photo issued citation course offender still go court contest charge red light cam tend pretty cut dried speeding youre going photograph there stable frame reference like red light cam youll telemetric evidence private individual thats something defense verify without accessing vehicle providing information
michaeltorrisi evidence speeding simply reported police review chargefine necessary imagine evidence would much verified similar red light photo verified via officer reviewing get rid need defense access vehicle order verify information long police pressing charge review evidence good also lawyer though dont know sure also usa doesnt speeding camera live although havent caught speeding pretty sure way work get caught get fined fairly cut dry maybe using driverless car spot speeder implementable country due difference law dont really know since lawyer regardless interesting scenario think
next obvious questionisnt next obvious questionthis bias logical next question something fun watch movie yeah sleep concerning statement point line drawn observation human error cause accident hardly revelation everything carry risk could potentially benefit kind technological surrogacy presenter could eliminated cgi look like enjoys work certainly risk reduction prevail could stay home bed watch movie sleep
stella make liveable walkable city liveable
im would love autonomous car thing worry taxi trucking industry million job world wide wiped clean replaced computer something consider think
even human let small group people rule pleb control machine kill humanity new world order
impossible machine make making statement watched fsdbeta way intersection way stop sign drone view ignoring stop line msec repeated later fsdbeta unprotected obscured left turn drone view repeatedly crossing solid line entering opposing lane msec far alpha version shown two year ago stop line solid line opposing lane clearly detected car yet car ignored road rule p correct statement almost impossible car safety net waymo mobileye prevent neural network make rule breaking decision make tesla nothing stop neural network making stupidest mistake
felt like ad sponsored video
disagree video nothing waymo lot generality self driving vehicle waymo isnt particularly unique tech using self driving taxi service use general idea work suppose could done completely nonsponsored video gone around service compare dont think content would changed much
lasagnaforbrains speaks advantage sdc way would ad emerging technology true isnt speaking company time doesnt seem mention challenge disadvantage compared regular car still need work constantly throwing claim good technology would bring part reduction traffic come mind understand video minute condensate lot information sponsored video expected would also say maybe shouldnt speak sponsored video brand sponsoring conflict interest
question detection system car told use laser detect see surroundings happens one car close proximity car would laser signal detected false image would painted even communication different car even better foresight possible
latter
probably much problem mobile phone radio bluetooth wi fi invisible laser weird term electromagnetic radiation
would able eliminate parking lot
thing stay manual car one cant give computer choice life death emergency situation ridiculous
willow also issue take one huge lawsuit tech vanish decade
autonomous vehicle disenfranchised heck dumb people even
want see car trying navigate bangalore
really cool round data waymos journey affect driverless car driving efficiency mpg
think time car grandparent driving yeah need driverless car road soon
option would never risk life car human driver
doesnt flavour veritasium flavour video marketing feature film
please let drive naples italy
see troll people around seem say one beautiful woman around yes hard believe right believe either wrong perception different group people one specific person
took minute forget driverless vehicle future recipient darwin award
introduced yesterday live would step autonomous car without hesitation really people trusting people instead computer trusting wrong variable
car drive uk road road well kept
hit nail head least good condition make perfect sense think tech year away condition may true put car india china africa russia italy south america
modisk germany amazing road everywhere
nizart road german city way complex american road although well maintained see selfdriving car driving around easily
koenschouten well yeah european city arent build grid car still able
nizart hopefully done german company trust way car american one
think point stand le accident big number even performance reduced half still le accident hell even come le accident still mean cheaper ride lower parking needed
worried ransomeware attack hack affected multiple time sure internet access vehicle ok
make good important valid point sponsorship waymo undermines credibility video especially like moral dilemma havent hurried relaxed regulation thats tobaccoesqueoilesque etc denial undermining reality risk undertested producttechnology begin making billionaire even richer weve made sure wont also kill people there proper consideration safety issue driverless car video reason shouldnt worry issue would fine hadnt got sponsorship interested party appreciate need income isnt antisponcon anti blurring line scicomm marketing legitimately trust scicommer wont know might leave retain sponsorship whether research used marketing material including safety report take barrel salt like would advert
remember people loose job thank good
say im opinion selfdriving car make road lot safer however keep scepticism come extreme weather human aspect selfdriving care dont mean passenger inside car short seen video like taking place new car wellpaved road city worst weather offer fog rain bit dust anything short weather seriously damage sensor aging car computer component selfdriving care longer used b part replaced c software update require newer stronger cpu old car longer eligible used car sale e kind maintenance car cost involved selfdriving car everyone afford buy car b cost replacement part c everyone able afford part frequency replace form planned obsolescence like many computer e integrity used car sale quality safety car aspect extreme weather environment sturdy sensor take beating hailstorm b car handle get hit solid dirt rock jump car drove c quality car poorly washed sensor get obscured mud insect corps environment well car take extreme cold snow capable jamming moving part sensor e long sensor last unpaved andor poorly maintained broken road criminal element prevents someone hacking car taking aspect car including destination thus giving opportunity abduct people question still linger come back human laziness greed recklessness decisionmaking process
dont trust machine
driving almost year definitely need
recently got dashcam idiot road
work india xd would take car day cross street
love statistic frequently hear people think theyre average driver consider average driver ive driving year havent accident whatsoever dunningkreuger effect real
cant wait accidental death machine error
still lot logistics deployment issue thing maybe year might patched
longest waymo ad ever
know right selfrespecting youtuber twenty minute paid ad like hur durr normal vehicle kill many people hay employee driverless car car way safer way way safer
davischanges well look statistic driverless car crash car driver crash data
davischanges reason video took money belief technology said time time pushing development autonomous car nothing wrong defending something someone come say want money keep say yes
davidsegalle year ago channel derek shocked learn given vehicle emission released even driven quickly overcame cognitive dissonance accepted use hybrid car wasnt helping much enter waymo owned alphabet along youtube yes case safety autonomous vehicle overwhelming even sincere truly unbiased analysis would necessarily ask deeper question ad
michaelb real data even comparable size auto driving car study normal accident course higher sample size million
thats though isnt road need maintained well enough
first version yes get hang gps road map data scanning surroundings generally lowering speed area potholeprone sub par traction might work perfectly well
andersjjensen would great high threshhold driver better people incl
driver seat driverless car convert passenger seat
long governmentadvocates restrict right drive vehicle public road im autonomous vehicle make road safer enjoyable traditional car driving enthusiast love driving vehicle take away
forget toll road say hello fullauto road lol
think people still correct though year autonomous car seen road yes technology implementation take long time think surprising people expect short period
well since use drone believe autonomous feature concern human obvious cause issue u since current system relies central control administrate chance flaw happen guess mean
quite plausible people better driver average median though
derek great guy make phenomenal educational video technology real exciting right still long way go make fully autonomous vehicle viable regular road controlled circumstance planned route almost certainly waymo rep close make fly decision car system made error response error another car also little weird he video main focus product company sponsoring thats advertising extra step
technology exists lablike condition like waymo work area thats thoroughly mapped traveled cant dump autonomous car random road expect work still year away mass adoption im extremely grateful technology coming huge step accessibility u disability think waymo add blinker sound even single click mind would tune subconsciously prepared turn
weve gotten first fully autonomous vehicle six year dont see mapping city would take anywhere near long provided condition good like thing preventing people
well wouldnt consider mapping necessary already map route service google map wazealso owned google extremely accurate specially america even tell lane take appears basic idea road connect still prototype would probably needed double check area
zweks map like google map nowhere near detailed enough waymo there reason operate small area took thousand mile driving area map everything high detail arent mapping road theyre mapping street sign traffic signal crosswalk parking lot etc
want driver controlled car road man held liable court ai selfdriving carnot much
come back drive rainy day london there reason testing desert arizona
butthey dont lot testing done city heck he video rain wouldnt affect lidar sensor
dawson wideopen road arent london street
dawson city arizona give year id say itd good enough general use though way
think human car car fully autonomous vehicle would communicate together time road would know every move car would point london traffic rainy day would like road world could even remove traffic light car could drive mph one would suddenly break make bad decision
drive better human human put particularly high bar driving rain
overtake chain driverless car crank window increase volume max play siren sound overtake
might work human
thinking thing
maybe kind light vehicle detection preventing
spaghetti would also yield unmarked police car
awokn maybe human eye invisible marker something
work nicely glossed working busier part world mean video light traffic sunny day came across one pedestrian like want see technology pushed
fact order work city car first need build complete super detailed map environment isnt gon na problem want spread tech
would need responds sensor actually see tactically plan bigger picture via gps google map navigation
successful driverless car test madeon indian road tends produce successful driverless car
next autonomous car india indonesia country trainwreck traffic
problem lot self driving system arent good waymo self driving car arent level waymo banned entirely true people stop paying attention lot experience tesla self driving system suck creates false sense security really dangerous
would take waymo specific claim video grain salt theyre sponsoring video one company among many investing technology
ospritely thats fair general eventually get point good self driving car exist shouldnt delude thing already especially car even close like tesla
would still need driving license tell computer changed mind need go somewhere else stop cafe break want
would app thing
thatd easy id imagine select destination kind like youre getting direction google map selecting want go system decides route take wanted change midtrip youd change system would reroute wanted stop side road something might work driving suddenly saw cafe wanted go wouldnt able instantly pull sure
press service help button would change course ez peze
still need driving license youre driving youre passenger change destination time using touchscreen interface car
happens police tell pull there way ai recognizes police word pull
siren
driving fun could see motorway driving going autonomous car like unlike elevator airplane driving activity well mean transportation love drive dont want go away
almost certain allowed drive long keep paying rising insurance cost associated activity p
argument autonomous car collective experience several order magnitude broader human made asterisk opinion far know comparing human ml hour job doesnt translate anything meaningful really interesting stat approximates size training data waymo available
disagree million mile realworld experience waymo fleet meaningful meaningful human isnt able analyse every second every journey theyve ever taken make judgement based yes certain extent simply cant level ml
also look well x even happens roughly every mile waymo car experience z amount unlikely event human would likely experiencing thing first time car run event learn much effectively even one experience
agree michael ben there much ml model learn human impossible even would make summarizing study implementation teaching covering scenario impossible human time ml model made human data compiled human even automated human decide whats important record first place actually use arent far perfect still wouldnt sell cheap googlewaymo investment economic human effort kind scientific technical knowledge get refined time damn research area quite active
even bigger asterisk said phoenix area biased sample may misspoke havent seen report data experience translate place area arizona city far driving condition concerned rather ideal recently designed car traffic mind priority weather permit good visibility dry road
agree disagree experience onroad think really valuable thats reallife actual stuff every variable really exists world simulated stuff help learn similar scenario completely agree definitely isnt anything like comparison said person hour experience job could ton job without issue whereas ai hour training likely wouldnt able single thing
think tesla approach self driving car much scalable since doesnt depend high resolution map like waymo self driving technology company apply road earth unlike waymo limited city phoenix town
talking big city next year well year poll option seems fairly reasonable majority
poll talking technology though waymo employee believe technology itll take year get people onboard get past regulator
thepackerfan really clear actually ready vague term ready mean majority car driving fully autonomously honestly even say year absolutely reasonable ready meaning possible answer obviously bet people pressed year button know
jama technology already ready tho
jama dont think vague question feel self driving car option either cant wait scare wont ready decade context clue make obvious topic discussed whether technology ready rather widespread use ready
jama dont see anyone interpret ready mean majority car fully autonomous ready mean ready get used two interpretation technology ready ie safer human driving legislation approved use technology harder quantify starting point since different citiesstatescountries approve different rate
way better term safety energy efficiency way eliminating parking lot adding green space city without compromising mobility subway system automized train driverless car would probably partially solve problem traffic today compete efficiency proper subwaysystem
well waymo say take another year get fad city guess take another year fad everywhere
brilliant video huge congrats weimo wonder lidar v camera debate still thing
feel like video huge problem pretending best case scenario happen driverless car widespread im talking term safety fact purpose comment let ignore pretend much much safer human every situation mean automation improve life instead wealth inequality problem come
fear surrounding driverless car isnt driveless car human road dont think driverless car truly safe get rid moronic people also proper infrastructure vehicle communicate would great benefit
wouldnt mind would bad someone stupid people decide try steel vandalize vehicle would love vehicle partial seizure dont drive someone drive destination work home would amazing thing make thing easier
amazing effect observer source light
okay good enough there one driverless car time road among real driver whats gon na happen every car road driverless arent gon na expecting something anything
future old men
really dont like accident arent like control taken away obfuscated matter im saying matter enough go forward idea matter
would lidar behave two autonomous car next would two source light interfere
light pas trough light actually interfere get mean beam coming car confused bounce car b mi guess top head could use slightly different spectrum light source beam hit object bounce back light absorbed said object remaining light would bounce back allow discern beam bounced beam come straight another source merit missing certain wavelength
mother easily distracted driver used sometimes pray driving remember horrifying clarity moment huge transport vehicle nearly slammed side tried cross red light one many nearaccidents actual accident saw driving one absolutely get automated car
modern airliner autopilot handle entire flight terminal terminal yet still two fleshandblood pilot cockpit absolutely plan eliminate
pilot copilot mostly communicate pilot airport rare occasion control plane needed also help people feel safer person name tag give feeling youll ok
thats mostly quirk customer fact pilot salary negligible amount airline get customer flight opposed majority cost taxi service driver
well plane expansive carry alot life aviation company would want risk everything save pilot plane
earthnate whats first thing pilot event emergency turn ap take manual control think sort ai matter advanced couldve managed pilot flight taca flight flight ba flight aloha thats thing program creative reasoning onthefly problem solving ai also ap malfunction well instrumental malfunction affect ap common think automation nut seem forget automation ultimately programmed human automation remove human error equation bsod personal computer inconsequential safety standpoint bsod selfdriving vehicle car plane might wind costing life dozen even hundred people
get back one stupid contraption manages successfully drive queen newarkat night snow storm
ultimate test road bangladesh
could blast siren middle road make everyone pull
use vision wouldnt able tell relevant themie ambulance side road stationary ambulance
people properly factoring major riskvulnerability driverless car introduces there real possibility point driverless vehicle simultaneously brought would absolutely devastating vehicle option accident rate per mile im sorry
well one arguing cant lv av disagree lv data trained city high traffic bad driving condition also think airplane analogy flawed pilot make difficult decision av ie human insurance every situation tested plane trillion le variability something happening road would many order magnitude easier cite allow av road system designed av mind right still far early
im one think there still many year wait maybe like many others europe road old wont training data like talking road year old poorly marked maybe certain city would work sooner certainly highway driving ancient town centre scary drive
see future one car get large company maintain charge subscription fee one fee per ride call ride specifiy privacy level ie personal shared ride car show address take want go get assigned another rider
someone comparing selfdriving car airliner autopilot selflanding system limited visibility person fundamentally understand airliner work waymo like driving walled garden
agreed airline pilot flying today around weather must seen avoided visually using local knowledge experience wouldnt get automated airline aircraft next year minimum stuff managed today would never managed computer way automated airline way car
gminors future old man
im curious hear comparison valid
slightlycrookedworkshop different problem airplane tractor farm static known obstacle human moving unexpected way hiding behind bush
tec yeah make problem easier difficult original commenter implying making automated airliner would difficult automated car would like understand first glance seem fundamentally easier
cant drive well dont car thats solution crash accident want dependent corporation government stupidity lack dignity lack driving skill mine
well lidar work trafficjams worth lidar shooting ray time around
wouldnt theyre different frequency like wi fi work theyre another vehicle near could switch frequency
thetimelapseguy absolutely
people like driver someone blame go wrong who responsible waymo car make mistake injures faceless company would everything protect tech car dont make mistake mustve fault
simp tesla musk overestimate ai
isnt whats mentioned end driverless future pretty much europe public transport guess really got ta car land milk honey
see showed m ft away car stationery traffic light bit scary believe tech though perfect
big concern would people knowing force car stop potentially rob car literally move blocking even know lifethreatening situation teen try punk passenger running front car force emergency stop con artist jump intention getting hit receiving settlement know much leeway need give car come full stop calculating car hit enough force look bad enough serious damage
important thing taken control technology must procedure warn people anomaly occur like self checking procedure trust technology best performed machine like human obviously wornout someday
never possible unless one ban pedestrian human driven vehicle motorbike bicycle etc given area seems rather impractical area dense traffic
driver chef personal trainer history teacher doctor everybody java script drink gatorade tiktok challenge
happens road filled car though wouldnt sensor like laser talked interfere eachother
think biggest thorn type vehicle coming road legal part like accident happens car fault highly unlikely say happens punished passenger engineer go philosophical test safest option car go road someone disobeying rule traffic hit cyclist kind car
dear veritasium impressive im ive look uk government website see moment currently last year permitted uk road human driver able take control necessary graham w p wonder insurance industry make
actually believe make parking lot greenery adorable
oh self driving car like web programmed delay prioritize select group people harm implicate make look like innocent software malfunction happened web hype started everyone know ended whatever coded allows easiest manipulation
driverless car purpose rick drive gather intelligence law enforcement driverless car oh god rick welcome club pal
trust technology better u taking fast decision work working computer field seeing frequently computer crash stuck slowdown run time error still dont trust car
american always fail understand solution traffic isnt lane autonomous vehicle etc proper public transport system saying self driving car future safer electric talk synch avoid congestion falacy
defending waymo
messy ethic ai car also applies human driver ai car arent even really important subject something like
one poll fully expect see strong push towards automation biggest factor traffic collision people stupid unpredictable basic human trait nobody take equation shown source majority accident go away
want test limit come india
imagine amount jaywalking car autonomous would actually slow traffic
imagine since legal people abusing system would reported police would endless evidence since car constantly recording camera data lidar etc
narcyt end authoritarian hell hole like china literally implemented system take social credit score point citizen profile since government always go option give power im sure eventually push come shove
lubb
year seems totally plausible least adoption major city step major car manufacturer jump bandwagon
think itd better make car thats incredibly easy drive like tapping screen go
would love know taxi driver perspective
people still havent gotten ube
imagine car got hacked tho
downloaded app siren sound
yeah people suck driving lie good driverless car pretty much needed many people die bad driver
people dont stay lane lmfao world problem license free
always felt best way shoehorn driverless car salami method introducing automation driven car de facto driven question though lidar avoid interference driverless car lidar mean driverless car rare neglible million road think need adressed
one problem fully autonomous car even car road next couple year besides car transport one person car passanger dont like
even would trust self self driving car sure trust people way way way le self driving car cant wait illegal drive ourself public road prediction take year illegal take year start year inner city
would love see vietnam think there chance
whether autonomous car done safely way become unsafe prevent fe prevent simplified system also enter road producer want make cheap possible maintenance prevent old vehicle becoming unsafe safeguard programming error tampering responsible vehicle kill someone safe vehicle hacking either single car whole driving fleet new technology isnt making work ensure wont fail legislation need put place ensure minimum level safety always guaranteed responsibility
autopilot plane defined air route air traffic negligible compared road traffic possibility unexpected problem far le road traffic airplane regularly serviced kept pristine condition car high chance car puncture problem transmission engine etc much better invest public transport like train bus even taxi driversfor developing country rather thinking autonomous vehicle besides train bus driverless autonomous mode transport thousand people sitting railcar people sitting bus
capitalism always want buy stuff plentiful clean comfortable efficient public transportation dont need buy car thats public transportation never good could opinion extensive improvement railway network best solution vehicle emission could whole bunch electric train running driverlessly moving good people world high speed emission
actually made argument rolling autonomy mass transit first autoland portrayed video wrong pilot must still see runway certain decision height choose continue landing
bearboiblake dont like idea driverless anything putting human machine transporting hundred people boost confidence get train expensive give salary one person driving train carrying thousand life
marklek real need making train autonomous salary driver isnt really significant term overall cost video obviously sponsored waymo sugar coated statement
system get hacked horrible sci fi thing happenyeah might already figured thing unhackable
tesla might making mistake external microphone yet making visual simulation instead simulating intermediate layer dont care visuals
wrote already somewhere else probably someone already stated ill repeat anyway statement real moral dilemma programming safe soon allow self driving car street true one human life considered finitely precious human life considered infinitely precious one human life equally precious n human life therefore really real question precious one human life
people garbage road vehicle automated wouldnt traffic jam accident edit also million people stop dying car accident gon na run food clean water even faster would reason resist automated car taking away natural selection
cant wait time going lot unemployed people particularly men becomes dominant
new technology though tough luck first couple year eventually new task emerge society need real human
askemervigbahnson hopefully find new job
askemervigbahnson im sure least million people find new job
driving work every day cant wait see idiot lose driving wheel give mine voluntarily
nobody taxi driver ok
quite bit taxi driver gon na lose job
always wanted could anyone want
imagine killed accident people would reproduced even overpopulation today oo
understand derek saying ive got ask based existing driverless car sort per caput accident rate seeing compared traditional car
well gave statistic neer end least waymo car divide distance distance average driver drive compare accident number
hand please find way system overcome doubt le blood see road due human error better
mph freeway driverless car behind van obstructing vision truck turn last second avoid stationary car feel like human would better situation
add naseum many people commuting pandemic reality made many job virtual stay home work reduced roadrush hour traffic percentage fewer vehicle mean fewer accident fewer vehicle mean space recover mistake
disclaimer video sponsored elon musk
enjoyment driving gone forever
cold sound car hit question kind dumb even matter assuming human unlikely scenario made response pure panic could even hold
american take lazyness fuckin max
rip taxi industry
would love cant wait im still dont driving licence dont want hate limited movement honest plus maintaining car obscenely expensive prefer pay subscription service instead
car open damn door im late work im sorry dave cant isnt funny im dialling humour setting
want get sleep way work sleep get car get behind wheel cant rethink approach life happen like drive living still want see million driving job disappear driverless car want control go without share information everyone think twice want trade liberty notion security youre afraid everything everyone else support driverless car would right consider driverless car progress wont argue dont agree dont think technology betterment humanity betterment billionaire rely logistics insurance company want money dont want pay anyone sell mighty message dont buy think ok
driverless car india hard imagine
see insurance company would lobby hard would make much money yearly accident accident mean insurance
true lobbyist greed always slowed progress
insurance company lose money time accident occurs main group lose technology hospital since lose organ donor supply injured people
darpa u military research offered prize self driving vehicle sixteen year seen billion invested million dollar prize thats u
never seen ful video talking sponsorship offense
year planet taught im excellent driver terrible everything else im deeply saddened people want rush world million people like forced poverty time get another job already hear many typing rise form automation mean arent enough good job u go time ubi hear rest typing awesome year realistically take actually implemented ill go ahead starve one le mouth feed right
want driverless car road right car tho
im looking forward driverless car good enough road condition also cheap enough anybody one especially get advanced enough form hivenetwork providing utmost efficiency traffic traffic jam reason jam however going eventually kill million transportation based job predict within next year going need answer question gain living wage job filled robot cheaper safer
aircraft dimensional tracking capability elevator dimensional weather proof system ground travel involves finding hard surface using portion hard surface assingned detecting deflection hard surface sensor system function filth accumulates hard surface much like battery operated vehicle advertise range degree farenheit ever heard minnesota maybe dakota minus degree f dust snow etc coat sensor discernable lane track previous vehicle person experience road actually suposed hope sun belt enjoy self driving vehicle
going inside driverless car giant stop stealing data every ride inside outside vehicle
dont mobile phone data worried
want happen fast self driving car road already heck weve moon
there doubt autonomous car better driving human question happens something go wrong within car system cause unexpected behaviour glitch program
wouldnt feel comfortable fully autonomous vehicle car road also fully autonomous talk one another dont think safe rely camera alone lot thing interrupt camera confuse
thanks id rather pedestrian cyclist
would trust driverless vehicle better driving human guess best car road driverless self driving driver time creates danger
car driverless play soccer street listen revisionist history love waimo
close
bring ai overlord
tesla autonomy
really good video would like know tesla fsd compare
tesla level
there lot video youtube allowing see beta tester demonstrating current state system
thomashuijzer level cruise control level adaptive cruise control lane keeping get game level get gray area see driver putting much trust system lot people think level must make leap level illegal
major difference waymo system tesla system waymo car drive premapped road tesla vision system car drive anywhere plunk done right visiononly system tesla superior lidarradar system like waymo plus tesla full self driving system billion mile real world driving use teach system ai big difference waymos simulation unbiased autonomous driving expert agree tesla autonomous driving race even though waymo fleet selfdriving car road oh video doesnt mention every waymo car there human monitoring drive ready hit remote controlled brake operator surrounded monitor show feed camera sorta like there someone driver seat even though passenger doesnt see guess waymo didnt want fact known
marklek according tesla legal document sell fsd level feature
wonder car would deal jaywalker like nyc
pretty much new car handle cant get star safety rating without even year old cheapish korean ev
hepphepps safety rating dont account pedestrian collision u truck suv getting larger common pedestrian dying greater rate collision
onesob jaywalker pedestrian dying higher rate sure thats bad thing
onesob usproblem europe different comparison city million went year without single pedestrian trafficdeath
hepphepps make sense hope u come sens
try tesla free
bullst want carles people street car menace doesnt matter wether human machine driving
id excided needing car get around
there way even close computer intelligent enough drive car safely first still cant see weather also many situation real life require human understanding instance school zone reduced speed child present driverless car would able look around able accurately identify child adult right dont think even tell difference person inanimate object another issue traffic directed police officer flagman traffic cone used reroute traffic around construction accident etc human driver know ball roll street there strong chance child might run street human driver thus prepared stop human driver also use extra caution see small child playing near street driverless car tell difference small wild animal rabbit versus pet cat dog respond accordingly
well wrong many level
funny think thing programmed autonomous software arent already also extra caution human order magnitude worse default caution computer time
rudx selfdriving car maker required prove vehicle handle condition allowed road
raffayasif prove
problem news medium hunt automated driver accident make seem like killer car
im absolutely ready bring
let u allow technology overlord rule commute take away one le freedom safer everyone conform hive
absolutely terrified driving passenger moving vehicle need everywhere soon possible
whenever someone present moral dilemma like one video always ask well would get definitive answer simply say computer dont get clear answer get confusion reply vein well made point demand computer able resolve dilemma human cant properly deal really want go many flaw person video two motorcyclist making refrain supposed youtube comment novel ask would hit person helmet person without helmet clear answer computer dont clear answer something like well depends expect self driving car know answer expect self driving reduce accident rate derek point accident human error dont even involve vehicle
driverless self driving electric vehicle make literally every car guy die inside
tech cool definitely close perfection certain circumstance however never buy car steering wheel gas pedal need drive bit unmarked dirt attach chain pull something amount utility outside b vehicle always enough want full control power direction sometimes bet id sleep cross country trip remain legal overseer dont decide cant go km
like video driverless car amount mile driven indicator safety mile need representative driving condition context thus billion mile driven clear well maintained highway irrelevant want know safe snowcovered country road thus video doesnt show u anything didnt know driverless car better human come driving ideal condition want know well technology performs condition snowstorm heavy rain mud ice debris country road dirt road road indication paint line road shared herd animal humandirected traffic unclear construction planning etc anyways nice day cant wait technology fully operational
blackbird selfdriving huh scienceboy
wonder haooens bird poop lydar thing like take account camera would freak
main reason dislike autonomous car require driver present create new problem driver longer focusing longer present situation guy trolley almost ever person wouldve able see wasnt needed yet car driving x average person real world mile still couldnt work thats whats disconcerning
want steer driving fun cant see fun robo car
driverless car really future taxi route preplanned though
realistically going toy rich next year car already costing k basic model basic electric model even add top line automation system cost small house condo tesla around owns owns year old honda civic
taxi service fleet similar waymo would drastically reduce price especially start build confidence
probably wont car anymore like pay yearly monthly service
car still car thus inefficient
yes thats bad thing every new piece tech like car first came rich cell phone first came rich solar panel tesla foldable phone list go rich able take risk new tech great company sell product continue make better cheaper along way
yes use service like uber lyft early adopter already ubers tech roadmap willing bet youll able hail automated uber major city like la nyc within year
average real average john maleckis latest vid pour concrete stair epic back yard transformation pt average running gag
well difference average median precisely people median possible aboveaverage driving skill
veritasium mentioned speed bing cause accident ive interested science behind statistic think come frequentist approach understanding crash data wonder bayesian approach paint dire picture crash may indeed involve car speeding think car speed sf de facto speed interstate mph despite mph posted limit feel like car going slower actually likely cause accident even might le likely involved instance often see people break move right take exit cause people behind break maybe car back car swerve another driver isnt paying attention leading accident id interested see data accident also much hope least city autonomous vehicle near future coordinate huge gain efficiency arent even widely discussed thatd great video imo
problem technology modern car general work home low budget many others dont even like modern car getting complicated work cant hardly sheet metal welding work modern car metal carbon steel alloyed integral part frame sometimes even taking modern car local mechanic getting difficult one relegated big brand shop cost lot money worsens problem monopolization merging company ever bigger entity destroying small player even allowed work car future self driving right repair topic air right see company people much money cant empathise people le make argument shouldnt allowed work self driving car think need make sure right right repair made priority product built way allows
cant wait come
engineering solution accident certain percentage even horrible human never acknowledge disaster averted mishap occurred scary thought massive fleet driverless car hold accountable case disaster bigger company inhumane reaction tragedy potential political coverup agree lot commenters solution traffic public transportation letting go firstworld luxury personal car
normally case taxi driver notice there medical emergency passenger autonomous vehicle become aware react
there button call helpline button stop car
alternative title waymo waymo
plot twist someone running p controller
million mile waymo much better imagine possibility could tesla went autonomous drive billion mile data
waymo available handful location million mile many year tesla billion mile ahead limited specific location self driving car future waymo
bro driverless car come many drive lose job time pandamic many people already lost job people like driving car long road trip good sport car want dirve drivebro people dont understand scared car dont like car sure option autopilot fully driverless car bad idea alli hope people understand people love dirving drive money come fun job driving stand
great suburb good weather today itll year downtown boston snow storm san francisco fog tentatively human true cant wait though
generally scale like year automatic transmission started becoming efficient top manual driver around year invention chess engine took year beat best human player first engine deep blue beat kasparov assuming interest remains money pumped field still wouldnt expect driverless car thats better good human driver time half century
cool driverless car may better society doesnt use car first place
well mind changed seeing car see much testing done give confidence car excited future
privileged point view plenty road world still dirt country road full scooter pedestrian driverless work great grid based city paved road clear sign america world
slow adoption car manufacturer gas station city state revenue registration driver license police revenue traffic stop huge car insurance etc would dozen industry effected became mainstream think public transport suck bad
use timeskip hows waymo
would never use autonomous car regularly travel
im sure id nice people disability need honestly effort go getting car road setting well planned public transport
munichgermany amazing public transport would still like automatic car get place fast taxi ar way go moment expensive youneed pay driver course every countrycity problem transportation automatic car good may case
nizart make thing cheaper remove work force know may expensive paying taxi keep replacing job replaced technology well huge problem unenployment globaly already
ramontavaresdacruz yeah keep capitalism
ramontavaresdacruz guess people anyway
trust robot much human taxi driver robot interest breaking traffic rule earn cent robot owner also interest breaking rule least robot repair cost money human driver company formally ban dangerous practice indirectly create kind competition human driver break traffic rule earn something time driver charge company case accident human driver might forced pay company instead human repair case taxi robot driver also extra space one passenger cargo
everone hit autonomous button work people interact robotaxis doesnt work human need robotic work cant worried late work getting cut merging onto freeway rush hour traffic highspeed chase time
veritasium thank advertising something take one best emotion ever thanks modern people making dream child go away laziness thanks may take good thing autonomous driving take normal driving something gave purpose live
hmm anyone else realize car ultra safe self driving vehicle rest u speed recklessly safer automated car make space
clown circus
lkeil bring mother
want continue working home simply commute already game changer
life changing really
compared video one didnt quality unreflected biased
could make speed limit higher safer
yeah let go faster become le efficient ego human make car go faster everybody drove speed limit reasonable acceleration deceleration country would use le gasoline know huge
lkeil bad day bro car electric btw
mean wont need vehicle insurance per month car insurance
driverless car reality introvert yaa communication
main concern driverless vehicle weather going handle canadian winter especially poorly marked road communication tell another car stop sign theyre waiting move tell pedestrian cyclist reason theyre stopped think theyre going way
id tweak communication rule road rightofway youre stopped stop sign shouldnt ever flag someone though know sometimes follow rule driving wait turn dont think itll get stuck waiting pedestrian cyclist cross itll slow might stop abruptly like shown video dont make move start crossing itll start moving though probably slowly like normal driver theyre waiting person people way like normal driver itll honk horn move around giving safe distance long safe completely agree weather im sure waymo specifically know selfdriving ai lot problem poor weather thing id add concern something someone else pointed another comment video fare directed traffic like there accident construction work done road someone directs traffic would handle waved police officer without sign work someone proper sign random person flagging traffic seems like itd difficult deal
nightstick yeah four driver hit stop sign time right way even two driver human driver tend behave differently based mood personality im worried driverless vehicle meeting driverless vehicle intersection totally painless theyd actually follow dang rule
yah cool perfer charge command car plus like truck
used selfdriving car long ago called horse
horse probably drunk driving accident stumble bar climb pat neck say alexa let go home
indyola hahaha horse named alexa
mount horse taking control bridal rain autonomous riding self riding nobody back
aob yeah bit joke way bridal rain speak must call bridal shower
someone pointed green laser camera would crash please like see
remember first protoype automatic car literally godamn receiver top come long way also kinda like actual driverssince actually pay driver automated car amazing though
touched fully hammered every humandriven car come road get safer everyone adding autonomous vehicle removing human driver make autonomous vehicle safer regular car bus train motorcycle bicycle pedestrian
one ever talk people like driving car type video
yeah people like thrill robbing bank also many people like drive reason life lost year united state dont selfish happy got life lived
car enthusiast im going go ahead pas haha
hope seem sooner later one question hasnt answered yet responsible something go wrong dont get wrong thing safer many driver human unpredictable sooner later someone manage get hit self driving car way directly person fault hit question insurance company
technology may fully implementable next year country like india asian country place lane driving isnt practiced traffic law arent absolute traffic still controlled human instead traffic light people dont strictly use pedestrian crossing cross roadsi feel like place gon na well year becomes even bit practical
one problem going pay dense city like london new york autonomous car much practical sprawling city la becomes challenge car needed per caput think technology around corner logistics going bigger challenge
waymo decided l safe way proceed car least level autonomy earth level autonomy maybe level autonomy fancy sounding term mean car actually put turn signal turning however dont know level autonomy sound nice didnt actually explain phrase mean
couldnt even watch video
watch video
im excited widespread driverless car cant stand people driving actually want everyone road except legally use driverless car
dont get wrong im amazing driver stretch imagination hate able know someone going using turn signal make everything worse
disagree people better think better driver legally responsible legal status given automatedautonomous car case accident would legally responsible
million mile driver who filling gasoline
many people killed dont understand problem suffering people shortage
need uber car pick
well would lidar system function cold weather environment condition including ice snow
probably better human driver condition
want know technology retrofitted existing car
never economically feasible retrofit existing car
actually derek shitting wtf happen
fantastic video ive argued point raise year human driver horrible claim theyre average oh people even werent average abysmal trust vast majority driver people professional driver selfdriving car still close dangerous human still saved say life per year would worth theyre theyre far better human almost every single situation trolley problem hypothetical useless distraction people fail admit real world day day task selfdriving software infinitely better human perfect vision perfect attention perfect response every time always responded well would human instead would better ive never gotten answer isnt exactly car would slam break grab ohjesus bar wait area would prefer selfdriving car human even human trust every single time
go show ppl cant make decision many public transportation option need added make thing much travelable safe effective manner le ridiots car better
hmm always funny test place never rain snow
well technology still work progress right imagine tested place smallerdirt road made widely available public hand suburban area seems like self driving car arguably safer normal driver time would like see test done densely populated place like nyc la well
um sponsored waymo look elsewhere objective view driverless car
become evil
yea yea self driving car saving thousand life fine girl cute thats much interesting
think forgot say one important thing autonomous car le traffic
weakspirit yes sure meant replacing human driver selfdriving car make significant difference highway pedestrian
love use testing demo clip car enthusiast support autodriving vehicle city driving enjoyable activity race track really would love time take nap morning instead stuck traffic hour work
autonomous car reduce fatality real moral dilemma getting road sooner exactly talking literally saving life million people yet people fixate blame something go wrong something already go wrong every day benefit anyone blame drunk driver killed family four
importantly people autonomy driverless car remove unless youre disabled driverless car detriment life lose little control life reason fool consider good thing
envious temper longitudinally present halfbrother recurrently doubt humorous selection gigantic endurable bomb
dont mind driverless car still want ability get drive give right drive car
use indian man helmet le biker
knew guy engineer drove ford truck made park farthest lot
phoenix arizona like saying frisco dont anymore
q much graphene one kilo graphite
ultimate testing ground car golf course parking lot soon man get golf cart sense road sensibility law gone car would freak f lot local muni said cant wait driver horrible
derek really disappointed really show sponsored video flat poor job presenting challenge autonomous car face reach wide spread adoption agrue waymos autonomous car safer human driver believe data support current state autonmous car function niche area given tho constains misleading say autonomous car could large benifits apply benfits subset mile driven also glossed techical finacal social challanges autonomous car still face yes still going year see wide spread adoption autonomous car car road
ambivalent driverless car safety yet another solution trafic keep individual transportation believe real cause problem individual transportation also worst energy ressource efficiency huge problem basically im worried implementation selfdriving car another excuse useimprove public transport
derek seriously youre better stopped watching part disclosed video sponsored waymo youre climbing waymo car review waymos driverless car seriously whats point noone going take say impartial credible may well exxon sponsoring video climate change kudos disclosure though
yas please commuting longer feel like waste time smth else
autonomous car problem problem car driver manually people
limited set roadway close ideal condition ok however would bet based legal issue imagine accident automonous vehicle one driven human think human isnt going shoot moon court hope waymo others deep pocket
clarkson said one day car would owned man called tim tim would think service
think driverless car probably likely people wouldnt need car anymore press button one show take somewhere go need picking literally taxi cheaper enough circulation wouldnt need car anymore driverless car end bought owned individual dont think people like tim would much problem probably people like tim already attempt service car stuff something even autonomous vehicle probably respond better threat human even tim flying red light car would likely avoid efficiently human
huonsmith disgusting dystopia future envision
carlothenord disgusting dystopia le accident worry car maintenance etc sound like utopia
huonsmith freedom vehicle give driverless car remove arent control anymore dont get make choice stuck dont cant modify cant customize cant demand sudden stop cant take road driving field beach cant go drive donut fun car maintenance valuable skill called thing growing person learned change oil new truck pain cause chose hard way felt good like tinkering machine reason hate electric car world isnt efficiency safety crap living arent robot
carlothenord youre talking different scenario talking situation dont need car anymore unless normal car outlawed arent produced anymore due lack demand highly doubt anything envisioned come fruition even event normal car outlawed highly confident recreational driving would remain thing would simply limited private road road race course one envisioned dystopia
human bad driver accident stationary car
know perform extreme weather thats going stop anytime soon
aeroplane comparison isnt really applestoapples aeroplane highly regulated undergo exceptionally high maintenance closely monitored lifespan even fly single seater every single time fly youre expected inspection plane happens autonomous vehicle age owner dont keep part replacement happens sensor given car turn bit hinky already see tesla purveyor sexy luxury car cut corner manufacturing fit finish issue selfdriving software keep shown problem selfdriving car get eventually real world different demo car lovingly cared motherhen engineer going take
meanwhile tesla joke
id ride one problem cant drive would godsend problem id car price dont know could personally owned
think point dont one basically call one like taxi uber dont like seems business model going
transportation get cheaper skeptical could see driverless car relegated wealthy driverless car wealthy significantly comfortable stuck driverless vehicle people go way flight see taken away act traveling enjoyable fun become another area captured exclusively wealthiest folk
one thing autonomous vehicle never better fun driving people like drive sometimes particular destination explore see end also human drive trillion mile existing condition safety record hard compare big one late work still get amount time people used speeding indeed dangerous people accept always going speed limit vehicle autonomous speed could certainly increased long mixed human speed limit currently human exceeding
big problem ending likely never happen people like driving
yeah get boring let fast drive without getting caught noticed speed limit road fast driver think get away stupid sign say
put halfdozen racetrack program finish first see one even finish
id inclined watch normal race way exciting lmfao
gshoemake used simulator driver wouldnt car fear death would gone theyd crash
already exists altho first ever attempt car turn right go wall first thing lol
gshoemake unintended pun
nothingsee thats exactly racing game like iracing
wonder car would handle robbery kidnapping seems like would easy stop passenger would helpless human know run someone
love freedom driving still might driverless car im personally giving
driver le car start show real hazard road human driver may choice public large insist human allowed drive
lkeil fundamentally disagree value freedom safety live arizona road outsider insane better driver responsible one people lazy irresponsible
oh absolutely safe driver speed limit say mph set cruise control mph stressful thing majorly pissed every driver dont general mentality drive fast think possible without wrecking getting ticket never look shoulder always getting better economy car dealer advertised getting mile tire warranty car almost never breaking could get rid human driver could find driving peaceful fun
system always engineered manual overide assailant would able force current system stop simply walking street technology used extend enhance task driving current approach implementation seems misanthropic opinion
good point
youre losing derek used scientifically based seems youve sold corporate interest popular tech interest system wont work theyre either fully implemented segregated autonomous operated system
want driverle oh yeah get hacked xoomer yeah okay
snow
think tradespeople required driverless car sick cut nearly run road utility vehicle
like driving fun though dont like drven around even though know safer fun
yeah lot fun many people think driving e ticket ride disney wheeeeee oops
may crazy think would trust computer drive
even purpose elevator driver like dont press button floor want go assume must something profession
early elevator werent automatic operator controlled speed
cant come soon enough ready
im really curious handle scenario human directing traffic police directing traffic around crash worker directing traffic area road work
good question also wondered human activity could trip like playing siren loudly car stereo make pull
long car area wifi cellphone service car satellite uplink human could pilot car remotely roadworker directing traffic waymo could someone pilot car using laptop home part workathome job car finished passing unusual situation computerized control could resume could safeguard remote driver attempt speed crash obvious stationary object computer intercede bring car stop
samuelmuldoon human intervention necessary wouldnt sensible safer someone vehicle take control opposed someone laptop potentially hundred mile away trying maneuver network delay camera seems especially poor solution given situation situational awareness responsiveness necessary youre flagged area ton road work
yeah thats problem combination human robot road need get rid human driver asap
think thats level automation think theyre still working
elevator driver actually known operator
perhaps terminology wrong theyre driverless car rather car nonehuman driver
yeah im sure know he making narrative similar terminology useful
still seen many elevator
yeah theyre great cant believe shitting treat get one
longwoolcoat im sure great completely unnecessary
much car enthusiast fully support autonomous vehicle tech future
bet cant outrun murderus driver tho
think ill stick driving uh want uh h u n drive
something interesting help popularization autonomous car fact people gen z dont much interest driving people gen still dont money spend car concerned thing lose hour day driving trying found parking spot
psych there actually invisible driver
train
hey break say call try waymo could late night waymo infomercial
driverless car exist people india
thing idea human better machine driving true country like india driver dont follow rule take time reach level adjustability car happen soon think
dont tell cant want
basically effective there autonomous car autonomous car synchronize prevent accident
derek get organ organ transplant next veritasium video printed organ
oh still maniac driving motorcycle time
biggest fear autonomous driving car fear uploading mind computer lose control life future itll eventually happen itll take time people get fear real situation would someone die autonomous car say person someone people felt important major concern look thats done rocket industry time ultimately balance act dont want release early fear killing someone important shut permanently dont want wait robot car reduce number fatality said obvious allowed drive important people making situation possible destruction using robot car quite time president us motorcade small way protect robot car motorcade outer car protect inner car robot car likely clue green light turn red average driver knowledge could help keep motorcade together electric car massive acceleration stopping power could motorcade protect inner car ever hit unpredictable human behavior
dont want driverless car love driving
thats car crash people like damn passionate invested
zeldagigafanmatthew know driving instructor five year ive tow truck driver nine year see end result crash know cause know nearly car crash caused ignorance driving skill inattentiveness driver environment sort people interest passion driving need get b dont force passionate driver car road fascist
zeldagigafanmatthew fascist expressed lack interest driverless vehicle want shut voicing opinion ive heard opinion disagree
cool continue drive get special license higher trainingtesting bar tech mainstream dont mind letting people continue drive going start holding higher standard there safe autonomous alternative
cutebabyseal yeah really good idea tbh test integrate economic driving standard one think derek didnt talk driverless car actually economic driver human ever dont unnecessarily rev gear whatnot
many instance condition driverless car make right decision also road layout intersection properlyalmost like uneducated driver hesitant proceeding
hard pas acutely aware frequently hardware software fail im going giving control transportation go vowed never buy vehicle somebody else could shut remoteeg onstar certainly trusting one entirely controlled somebody else
every majority city fleet
skeptic technology always jump edge case listened subject
would prefer live echo chamber hear want hear shun anything might conflict belief cause see thing someone el perspective
lidar laser interfere sensor vehicle lidar know laser came one
amazing question really want know answer
concern driverless vehicle twofold first eventual restriction driver driving experience driving second reliance computer many function society risk losing infrastructure made possible leaving many without basic need met self driving vehicle one function could lost without driver make difference time came
listen ill watch new video two make whats annoying constant video recommendation video homepage year ago excessive
trust thing idiot wish everyone asap
great benefit driverless car love driving enjoy lot probably time control certain street
liking sponsored video specific topic
human error always thing reliance technology always bring unforeseen danger technology never absolute safety net
either freedom security id choose freedom day
technology never absolute safety net good technology much better safety net human experience human generally suck mostly think world revolves around make think thought like im late work therefore nothing bad happen go speed limit im careful speeding right obviously universe doesnt give rat as reason thought prayer hoping dearly care momentum surface friction inertia rule obeyed always
automobile already technology relying technology make technology safer isnt relying technology
agreed overreliance technology isnt necessarily good case fact machine going better pretty much every conceivable scenario human react faster human alive possibly physically unable achieve reaction speed computer see human possibly direction get distance vehicle accurate millimeter thing cant act outside programming might work specific unbelievably rare scenario even long follows directive getting destination without hitting anything win know experience every single time drive anywhere see people phone theyre driving speeding quite lane drift lane turn cant think last time went driving wasnt least one time thought people terrible driver one reason another thing selfdriving car would never definitely dont think technology ready worldwide rollout right stretch imagination dont know five year time think matter dealing edgecase stuff irregular road weather condition core technology
waymo disneyland ride one city wide track
vw auto brake two week ago got confused locked brake reason almost wrecked car keep autonomous car awy
flaw anecdotal evidence youve bad experience assume normal statistically speaking auto brake measurably decreased number accident especially younger child
pushing much harder even better car communicate
see here thing nobody push button make car drive anywhere dont want go current car
sorry still video obviously biased sponsored waymo
im excited actually think would safer eliminate human driver computer drive everyone
straight flat dry well marked pavement
jane yo check vid barely perform without assistance much le difficult situation driving freedom
think lady speaks portuguese sure
impressed move backwards
country india waymo bring back home
car would great tech put school busesgeat
fapping driving come true
always driverless car driverless car never talk need many car
awesome think missed major risk autonomous car hacking would change car become weapon
mean like car drunk driver people texting yeah would tragic bad
technology implementation year developed world rest world
like year needed modified whole infrastructure achievable
think way longer people focus getting fossil electric vehicle autonomous car like waymo sadly also big car company wouldnt ever let earnings suck every dollar human long evehicle version number like smartphones today
idea city like new delhi
something like
likely bit longer think
monkey brain better computer
meanwhilechinese trying hack systemsgod bless driverless driving
im gon na fun pranking driverless car like guy shopping cart
get life
driverless car probably better driver human learn drive problem million mile driven perfect condition succeed therefore making conclusion invalid live tech would work line road seem optional best road work sometimes confusing guess go snow storm cant see anything way tell road completely covered may first one go tech year dont necessarily need self driving car really need tech save as screw
main fear autonomous vehicle really capitalism start play bigger role sure company providing whose main almost sole focus provide safe autonomous driving happens lot company start competing attractive one easy way attractive lower price well lower price keep expense well know cut gon na take could well part end making lot le secure also dont really think comparison elevator plane great operate environment controlled closed public
derek want driverless car thanks like driving maybe yall use public transportation
kill taxi business
sir admit thats impressive see fully autonomous car work human driver mean much operating vehicle autonomous car another transportation system consume like bus train taxi plane regular car extension body technically also mentally question much individual autonomy would want transfer google company one day car tell drive location gon na cheat partner drive office youve fired car already know worse case scenario car transportation whole country stopped sabotage company problem political decision autonomous car add transportation system make sense replacement individual car traffic would bold implication regret soon
secondly regarding hypothetical ethical scenario waymo demonstrated pedestrian moving trolley come complete stop let motorcyclist hitting stationary waymo validated real world simulated data accident waymo pedestrian skateboarder cyclist stopped next question
tesla ai general waymo data tesla robotaxi way safer condition human im paid waymo done research
fact dont think people good anything requires repetitiveness make mistake fatigue false assumption lead incorrect outcome let robot repetitive task enjoy life driving skill systematic environment ie fully developed road rule regulation environment
think might pushing say replace car park green space thats another decision based political motivation minor nitpick aside good see video like despite sponsorship tainting slightly mine two thing pick would human nature people wont give driving benefit self drive car really show car self drive computer wont hold back factor human driver also car ownership thing whole narrative life coming age taking test buying second hand car owning car change even lease hire car stay outside office house big change society come thing concern video hint road condition understand alot company based phoenix due high quality grid like road im uk drive town far back roman empire guess town exactly car friendly multiple choke point nearly far away possible phoenix
intoxicated computer car yea
think im average driver low opinion driver
pretty low standard argument made video compared rest content seriously consider whether blow integrity worth
loud though
make offensive statement google car something something illegal car lock door drive police station even owner vehicle consider right repair
accident happens human beacouse ai calculates doesnt think look bad weather
video seemed like pretty serious propaganda
actual fact object content video dispute fact given video
michaelb seen huge infomercial rather like investigatory video probably got paid waymo likely wrote entire script video incredibly different normal content channel
enclipsed actual objection fact presented fact present opposition right sponsored content misleading biased doesnt mean even academic study sometimes funded interested group must course report paper mean inaccurate conclusion data doesnt necessarily actually look fact cant say bought paid throw dont believe lie
people hacking car make go faster
knew recognized something peculiar letys accent googled name discovered fellow brazilian nice original name leticia cavalcante
fuga de crebros n
""
pixel pretty lady smart chick hot
knew good confirmation haha
instead trusting instinct trust google life
greatest skepticism around poor road condition road sheet ice going stop completely go slowly go quickly going road previously perfect conditioned mph hit sheet ice road completely covered snow visible vehicle react flooding vehicle differentiate inch deep puddle foot deep puddle much snow much snow continue accumulation decides infront inback deep youre stranded
reason soo many accident road human error car autonomousit much safer lol
going happen several reason liability malfunction tech responsible repair pay damage caused driverless automobile owner going pay werent driving manufacturer look firearm alcohol industry know manufacturer isnt going pay insurancelol insurance industry crash longer charge higher rate due driving recordwho liable local government municipality experience huge revenue cut speeding ticket running stop sign red light ticket following close failer maintain lane parking ticket duo safety check pointsall stop much local government budget made paying citationsget ready huge tax increase make loss revenue hacking signal lossif ever experienced loss service due natural disaster tornado fire hurricane ect long vehicle becomes usable issue top headthe become dependent tech vulnerable become
elevator operator driver saw many year ago memorably la county hospital one see beginning general hospital driverless car much bigger advance save million life every year
southern state great state north snow condition nope
idea like public scooter call waymo tell need car need get destination send car people computes long get theyre going drop order thatd pretty wicked though super sucky there unvax folk another pandemic happens
today article tesla mistake rising moon yellow light
hmm wonder perfect human ever make mistake hmm
lkeili never mistook moon traffic signal
come city waymo go highway rush hour crowded street waymo camera lidar radar tesla beat far ill surprised tesla level ten year
driverless car could also prevent lot criminal escaping police think getaway car cant
hope never get adopted many robot
vehicle waymore experience human driver see
many people love car love driving included could care le smart ai
self driving car safety want drive fun closed road
clip amazing lol
used good educational content channel ad unsubscribed
people would disability mentioned first test also people enjoy driving prefer manual gearbox build car mix modded amateur rally clean grand touring car ground custom chassis etc enjoy driving im also midwest joke people fly could drive yes thats laughable statement drive cross country trip rather taking plane love trip technology chunk bodywork ive done flipping car incorrect usage lane assist assisted driving bad driver everywhere car others road cant expect traffic zone predictable rational matter dont hate idea im also driving enthusiast meant also see system fail average person
see autonomous motor sport would love watch completely autonomous f race f race decided engineering team driver anyways
pretty sure already thing
driving affect personal autonomy asking u give another private company track go sell information advertiser law enforcement without consent
use platform promote autonomous vehicle instead better option like high speed rail public transportation improvement
cool get rid giant nipple roof
claim software validated every imaginable code path never make mistake need see realistic metric often car screw trust
funny thing autonomous car million mile driven human make certain amount mistake certain amount death autonomous car make single mistake people rally street removed
lkeil cause mistake important detail know human make mistake error thst caused autonomous car fail also neural system non deterministic never trace decision made error happened
lkeil also matter liability maker try assume car made
wtf delamain
le normal thing start becoming weird person refuse us uncomfortable like internet ride share cell phone smart phone elevator non believer burried efficiency inevitable autonomous grid
like human job im voting unless ubi place okay
would voted car elevator say there human employment problem could result could become efficient collectively adapt
ratamacue still require human operate progress happen recognize currently transition put many working poor individual work send generation cycle poverty bridge job next job replace wont time
theyre going really useful trajectory ie startingending location inconvenient transit also need better mass transit city u need badly lot part world achieve mix mass movement rail smaller mass movement bus minibus also intelligently routed autonomous vehicle awkward private journey string thing together route efficient multimodally yes thats dream importantly though consider cost accessibility chiefly ownership many job lost wont replaced time huge profit made wont necessarily feed back public pocket way private driver cabby tax want future based around kind tech need seriously realign money work
cylist would love see sure see
driver cant wait fully autonomous bicycle
would nice see limitation technology discussed arizona bad weather le likely mess sensor lidar radar camera limitation arent exactly tested desert
ageorgiev automation take one day video bit one sided though due sponsorship lidar camera issue fog rain example work well arizona necessarily pacific nw example radar doesnt work well henc reason use three together form good picture
maurus google running driverless car testing seattle area human vehicle make legal minimal conversation staff handle weather better human driver think issue crop dealing human following set rule vehicle would likely fail miserably india freeforall also break unusual situation human changed rule maybe someone directing traffic get concert car park find solution item think standard stuff come regularity united state vastly safer driverless vehicle
likely technology used sensing road traffic condition use tech available come safety human
seat belt dont use bus
rather design automatic vehicle dont build automatic robot drive car stuff well
seems like completely reliant internet function
remember who better driver poll lmao
cant speak everyone think thing driver thinking theyre better average say le evaluate feel everyone else know im mediocre driver ive also seen firsthand many people stuff even know stupid dangerous level think understand human awful driver general make mistake assuming well never end position
self driving car isnt cell phone like shitty driver im
want one live kansa anyone life midwest tell get anywhere without car nearest store least minute walk away pretty important car unfortunately however suffer narcolepsy get license kind technology would immensely useful could finally live normal life fully independent instead rely someone else get need go would much safer wouldnt worry getting wreck wouldnt worry stranger picking many benefit technology simply overlooked people think theyre decent driving look even line car road driverless might actually able use car full potential getting place half time dont traffic jam also wouldnt break quickly car people drive theyre programmed efficient really could sold technology already
well car see car around also shooting laser beam car sold one unique laser color pulsing pattern crossing path laser beam well various surface may reflect firetrucks flashing light interfere
im sorry still cant bring trust self driving car whats say selfdriving car like networked device cant hacked
make think delamane cyberpunk wouldnt cool self driving car sort cute looking humanoid robot seat safety thing case passenger would beed take whatever reason consideration curious come choice
doubt capability autonomous definitely safer average human driver privacy issue think need attention since car able record surrounding environment degree wonder much data company retrieve user
country car know daily routine government worker thats pose significant threat nation national security mean know highly unlikely given prior experience u spying world must cautious
video sponsored waymo whole video ad skip skip
tesla way ahead anyone else look fsd beta video
car road driverless could communicate much much safer human driven car human operated vehicle always allowed think radio beacon every human operated car autonomous car account unpredictability human
driving license handed easily many discount road rage new driver lack discipline forth human loose canon people claim better machine need witness idea car automated little crash know feeling driving often defeat idea survival people road people wan na drive always fight yet breath careless driving want still drive practice safe driving
fair automation airplane limitation autoland example tends max crosswind component knotsdepends type aircraft human safely fly actual crosswind limit airframe mention il need working properly il l sfo day asiana crashed asiana accident lot mistake made accident rare developed country automation played big role safety however automation break time plane still need fly ultimately automated car arrive one day much much safer specifically vehicle road automated
good liked enjoyed video veritasium however element seems associated fact let drive car future know u really like driving maybe considered somehow saying
tbh think automation need atleast sort human interferance bc would probably devolved become dumber reliant ai thats ai eliminates human like neuralink make u know thing without needing know know
youve sold skynet see
derek derek thank brain essentially year thing consider car handle poor weather condition eg snow slush rain switch fully auto car person car would checked regularly update hardware weathering controversial invade privacy ordering car taking place thought id like hear others
dont believe driverless vehicle better excellent focused dedicated driver dont think ever hope focused people enjoy driving always allowed control vehicle thats issue issue lot distracted inept driver road people tired drunk high emotional behind wheel dont choice want people hit others weave road friend seizure interstate highway crossed meridian luckily narrowly missed oncoming traffic totalled car far ditch never told anyone seizure ive also seen completely utterly inept driver like grandfather wow wow vehicle necessary many part modern world dont think people truly love driving forced rely autonomous vehicle however there whole ton people would benefit greatly cant wait common sincerely believe number car accident start decrease
tell car want go know stop gas would love able drive long distance stopping meal bodily function stay night motel
im much skeptic driverless car becoming thing yr give thought watch overall thought positive fantastic job much le cynical although still think train something esp u xd nice chrysler pacifia able deal maryland suburb traffic turning truck poor road ambiguous road marking etc cherrypicked routesroads test performed car elevator wait got good job good job pointing problem level autonomy really dont like tesla system almost encourage people tune whats happening average driver yup sound right xd error impossible machine make id like data highway driving yeah quite yet reduction fatality fantastic know become better think main thing le level stuff either distraction dont need middle aim even though car lanekeep assist radar cruise rarely use focus also hear advocate driverless car arent company developing yeah course theyre gon na enthusiastic optimistic thats great want see le biased study
waiting driverless car long time
top doesnt try chitchat
want one
ok future ad win trip go space im watching car drive
im glad get see inside one first time bit disappointed didnt talk issue snow though still issue
tesla probably active fsd everyone
cant worse one driven moron day freaking phone
right taxi driver seen video
think question hit worst case scenario overlooked video think people see video agree safer whole made corporation care profit necessarily safety consumer least know choice like went development software enabling technology
im taxisservices like owning one thats legal ride back case people drunk even emergency need attend someone get hospital ambulance isnt best option case regardless going happen become widespread time go tesla done great job far still need work especially affordability factor many variable think getting whats funny remember driverless car tested back required specially marked road keep car lane well car using sensor speak super expensive cool way past thankfully
side many cab driver get jobless
absolutely love aimachine learning autonomous vehicle also efficient make computer network vehicle communicate together concern get hacked
well human certainly get hacked dont believe send text person driving right almost guarantee look phone probably another poll state driver think handle texting driving better driver
youre wrong aviation part asiana accident sfo pilot used landing manually thats major problem asian airline airline west pilot required manual landing often stay proficient also asiana accident il approach system inop
viable solution lidar expensive
much energy trip take compared unmodified vehicle engine
many red flag mention oh congratulation becoming full time big tech mouthpiece derek
make sad many people forget train form public transit exist think stop patron next month
coconutgameshd train public transit dont cover lot distant rural location dude hows person wheelchair gon na roll mile get bus stop
coconutgameshd building countrywide public transit country like united state land city stop ever meter impossible finance sphere influence might citycentric everyone lucky need perspective also houston city state
coconutgameshd yes argument public transit realistically serve everyone
dont like idea driverless car regardless safety benefit first step law formed take away ability manual motorized vehicle probably regulated people willing dish heavy amount money time paperwork obtaining manual vehicle may one might even allowed use certain road certain city county even state may need modify vehicle visible autonomous vehicle either law risk hit one didnt see
could hacker control
equipment failsshorts outbreak car go cliff headon traffic main problem see
yeah like reliable human driver heart attack passing drunk driving take chance computer thank much
isnt car worry could magically convert car autonomous car tomorrow id transition period im concerned aggressive driver already aggressive toward driverless car
people live place there snow every year take many many year get working
ability save ton life there ton research backing claim mean country revolt
im excited driverless car amazing concept sure keep accident happening accident recently neighborhood yo died tboned would never happen driverless car
autonomous car cant avoid human error vehicle ready
nothing idiot proof
perfect car grow bit add seat take back street people car leave bare minimum good commute
sound like metro
add expanding foam car
would give liberty exchange little safety deserve neither liberty safety
terrifying idea fully autonomous vehicle became norm would hacker could take advantage manual control always priority never take away person ability decide best course action robot still arent smart enough reliable enough decent option public large happens someone able make simple repair dont administrator access car computer likely hurt freedom far long run help short run
one concern u heard accident selfdriving car aimed human driver lead elimination driver dont care much anyway im bike life
yeah hack car fuk
accident caused human error said impossible machine make im pretty sure impossible machine make human error j true
well old saying go err human really screw thing requires computer
plus phantom traffic
weather restraint vehicle
broad use driverless car would basically require removal private ownership car call hard sell moreover cyber security nightmare driverless car head imploding mention liability liability liability tech half battle pretend hidden danger absurd
making city pedestrian friendly one guy made video response cgp grey traffic video talked real answer traffic pedestrian friendlyfocused city public transportation better overall rather self driving car made interesting point cant remember guy called video fairly recent easy find
airplane elevator dont people animal jumping front unexpectedly computer follow preprogrammed algorithm incredibly reliably however considerably le adept dealing reliably unexpected circumstance said million idiot driver license would indeed better autonomous vehicle driver practice pay attention better taking control
toss think technically car autonomous would infact safer ever milestone long away human error vehicle even catch autonomous vehicle guard accident end like driving like customizing car going spirited drive car person cant imagine life im forced give driving something passion mine inevitable future hope live life basic fun carstrucks long eventually outlawed forced either stored destroyed
good till glitch animal human step bad road conds hope dont get killed car cant evade threat
want fully autonomous vehicle get tesla
get car never worried going accident always worried cause accident ride passengeronly car cant fault thats big plus
people compensate safety gain seeking dangerous leisure activity
single ride experience make feel like working perfectly far know ride get stuck various situation weird thing sometimes company team need take help car passenger solve situation comm link company service feel safe help numerous service call calm suburban area snow many different kind weather easy make something work last take another double time needed work

drive car thanks
like idea taxi driver lose job people preferred driverless taxi human gon na eat one got job
someone excited driverless car technology still found video incredibly biased like
oh take logical evolution imagine car drive thats way operate human driver going happen say matter time argued since car drive well would public safety allow human operate youre going anywhere unless car big brother watching listening say might live see guarantee coming plenty drone like guy video happily comply
sticky baby conversly like crayfish simulteneously rush worthless garlic groovy miniature anger
lol literally mile house wonder get ride hmmm
bet lety brazillian
vehicle road still full human driver wary autonomous vehicle feel like ill feel way
nice part obey traffic law road rage av le worry driver med borderline alivesemiconscience reading cell phone message reaching hardtoreach item vehicle etcetera thumb also improve traffic flow
year easy hype train channel participating funding channel usually good pointing side topicthere zero mention possible roadblock technology full send idea autonomous driving mean phoenix az
get ur bias goggles listed potential downside unpaved road sudden stop thats
newuser never talked train cost maintenance
pedestrian
tech autonomous vehicle really safe need almost driver road year away need convert people longer driving quite hard due culture driving
electric auto driving taxi could make sense could charge waiting passenger
thats basically future people wont car instead hail car required itll cheaper taxiuber driver ubiquitous waiting time minimal
jameswilson hope
guy ever heard tram
jameswilson eeeeenh there much evidence people would actually want autonomous driving future probably going mostly privatelyowned vehicle one reason skeptical technology
basically great economic forum great reset nothing basically idea since dont simply rent one charge update newer version come problem seen comcast isp company still make profit barely functional infrastructure
tech isnt replace truck driver parcel food delivery taxi driver even pilot maybe farmer driving living saving payroll cost company paycheck dehumanization wonderful future sorry something technologically possible doesnt mean socially beneficial
future bob dont need human wasting time driving road hour end problem isnt automation problem way system designed enough foood feed everyone enough housing think bigger
newuser call wasting time million people called job brings income ability support oneself family live dignity yeah system huge part problem show meaningful movement towards reform nope platitude high bunch self serving c rap techno type wonderful yeah great corp tech master serf suck maybe learn code jesus dont even want lousy uber pizza delivery job far people going pushed revolution come automate every single possible function cause good right usa right health care education cost total joke trillion indebted basically safety net minimal investment people plenty investment ai say think bigger due respect whats needed usa place bigger pitch fork guillotine mean sincerely
skeptick exactly need automation like people die sbustantial number people realize system wont work long term way change come bandaid solution would ubi
havent seen video monthsyears ago im confused
wonder work offroading snowblizzard
get car sick even front passenger seat im constantly watching road yeah prefer driving never get car sick
thought car sickness go away youve car long enough car sick whole life
performance snowstorm
good driverless car driver seat steering wheel dashboard etc
cheaper modify stock vehicle manufacture custom one first test car like one shown custom made tiny number current scale hundred practical plus fall back warranty underlying vehicle reducing cost salaried mechanic dont certify anything crash test etc etc requirement reach thousand economy scale change im sure go cockpitless
driver le car could start new form terrorism emp attack since car electric
sorry survey say ehhhhhhh every car built today would survive emp blast seen movie case car early older worked computer whatsoever old beast
concern technology long take politician brilliant idea prohibiting manual driving name safety
hell technology isnt going ready decade lot tesla accident thanks
project awesome could drunk day without worrying cop
yes could also take straight hospital liver fails
lkeil trueee
im driverless car want one want nothing take uber whatever want go somewhere
automation tech isnt make think year fact car arent important europe whole government need green light slow process thing really slows automatic car fact one could messed way easier say elevator think vandalism happens public transport
like herd immunity everyone great group freedom fighter say communism
learned video want autonomous vehicle could get shitfaced still get home safely car
everybody got priority
car ballet thing modern vehicle even non autonomous relaying info wirelessly autonomous car know whats happening way dont need predict anything know advance car turning another one braking
julia profile autonomous car need gps know roughly camera radar hard work
hm invested lightrails
im afraid autonomous car longer car im using public car gum stuck inside handle
eww there gum seat gum
subscription rental tier guess anything gum stuck handle ridden drive start costing arm leg
believe microsoft lot answer relation people trusting automation since early people gradually conditioned expect shoddy software hardware conflict regular system crash need constant rebooting product home pc running hacked together software public view computer experience problem unfortunate commodore died linux isnt popular custommade computer running dedicated software mentally put bucket window vista dream day general public trust computer reliable
engineer nearly year experience hardware software system trust first happens fails second happens people longer know drive fails third airplane cost million billion dollar car electronics computer get pay fourth company always cut corner make buck make thing affordable consumer cant afford pay take make reliable safe autonomous vehicle fifth people generally stupid drive badly enough time imagine bad dont time
imagine driving car get close get angry look car there driver
better road rage driverless car killing six year old oh wait wasnt aiming kid
bertjones
car becomes sentient start road raging cutting people car even little compartment robotic arm pop start flipping people
turborooster old news story road rage like rage auto car cut passenger guess like guy killing six year old child driver
lame way cash stature derek
operate bad weather like rainstorm snowfall somehow dont think performance would stellar
seen normal people drive condition bar isnt particularly high imagine car would take slow give rat as youre late p
reason car elkhart county indiana try dodging amish buggy semi truck endless sea road construction human traffic director treacherous ice snow around simple reason car would fail fail hard
people talking driverless car even tho could make underground train
freight
perfect discussed channel
imagine every car stuck subway tunnel network go start heavy rain nearby dam opened overload subway start flooding one know drive car network tunnel km long youre dead
yet another random incredibly unlikely scenario concocted ignores fact died traffic accident car massively reduce number
toppro yes unlikely happen already happened china autonomous driving thing km tunnel getting flooded lot driver drowning one fault operator gate stopping people collect toll smth even flood
people dont care kyear road death blame gun maker kyear death gun
probeably gun useless
id rather public transit non car centric urban design
crazy idea solving traffic death use train instead car
here even easier one follow damn driving law people yes yes even one using turn signal indicate lane switch turn yes actually going around every turn corner recommended speed tried hearing idiot going around mph corner crashing dying ppl like good kid could ahppen
reiwalexy tried one work materially address traffic fatality meaningful way answer well year staring u face
absolutely look forward future vehicle fully autonomous human absolutely atrocious driver youve ever driven car know idiot driving around time car autonomous virtually car crash anymore
video got excited driverless car follow video talk thing like snow rural area worry think reason project phoenix
vehicle know exactly vehicle want go
vehicle talking itll ultrasafe
commute would take twice long programmed canadian
wouldnt allowed drive except special track
fun game eventually start revolution
aupexx drive
hacker come along disrupts whole country xd
always get better always
hate driving honestly cant wait driverless car
safe autonomous driving least year away look time tesla fails detect debris highway
year huh data use make prediction perhaps used magic ball
pedestrian change behaviour know vehicle driver
yeah walk street time want knowing car hit except human driver one
id ride waymo
yeah want car gone road driverless car useless matter put video answer train bus rest bike small car go max
like channel derek pure ad waymo little data presented autonomous car safety human make driving error imply robot car better
im driverless car type video seem like propaganda force public opinion one direction enhance opinion obviously early technology adopted quicker company like waymo turn profit fear early adoption adoption standard set low remember car manufacturer year perfect car still deadly design defect time doubt new technology perfected time soon
car manufacturer car tested rigorously however dont data every car time
insurance industry want people dieing accident car getting totalled
public transportation better solution
cant wait autonomous car way forward sure
sound like future going boring youll use keypad everything even walking house
blastme safer efficient there really issue
guess insurance industry hate vehicle
im better accounting paper accounting software evetime software pay tax p
actually would like public transportation
going pretend tesla doesnt exist
didnt even talk public transit
driverless vehiclescars bad thing like youve said potential lot good issue concerning safety priority simplest way actually minimize injury wrecking wasting city space upgrade everything hightech driverless vehicle fewer motor vehicle driver problem car car similar vehicle still needed different situation different people walkability bicycling public transport smaller greener safer motor vehicle way go like support driverless car video topic kind brush away criticism give urgent stressed feeling never sort video recognized true low hanging fruit solution city traffic commute health accessability disabled etc best way would driverless vehicle wherever possible grand solution make would fewer instance car could hit anything lower potential damage could happen happen anyway fewer car walkability bike bus special case road street designed lowered speed please derek read take moment reflect take look change could would make everyone better urbanism related course check channel bike city beautiful main youtubers topic urbanism city planning good day
measure whether autonomous car safer yes use
use train instead
love teach science th grader told prepared future u alone thirtyeight thousand people die every year automotive accident average flip side fantastic technology also tell student year old forgo getting driver license driver license statesanctioned identification card without driver license would say almost none student step social citizen able vote wont serve jury identify law enforcement problem travel getting boarding pas securing passport ironically driverless car may condemn many life disengaged community yes driverless car need way ensure citizen remain active part society
maintenance car damaged owner repair itor get old part wear actually cause accident regulated legal liability standpoint maintenance becomes highly regulated wherein government even gain ability remotely disable car behind maintenance car ownership become unaffordable poor
also fact tesla cant even get fully autonomous self driving working inside closed loop system designed pretty damning
human error im ready autonomous car many terrible careless driver
question always verifying system good verification well combination tech data scale course company secret wont share well wait third party system verification
personally im hoping autonomous driving becomes standard feature vehicle perhaps even form limited owner license allows people buy vehicle ride condition fully autonomous basically ability buy use car even arent personally qualified drive would point autonomous driving made would great either arent comfortable driving still want extra freedom disability stop driving enabling personal freedom even data backing safety autonomous vehicle human slow accept especially regulator itll probably least year vehicle sold fully autonomous driving function allowed north america feature advertised regular consumer basically see fully autonomous car thing youll start seeing regular people buying riding give year maybe itll normal car sold manual driving addon year manual driving banned outside closed course private property
drive thank
problem comparing safety autonomous vehicle actual human driven vehicle actual cause accident cause accident human driving mostly preventable predictable cause accident autonomous vehicle basically thing every time system encounter situation isnt prepared handle doesnt handle properly end making wrong decision unknown factor scare crap scare crap everybody tbh fact encountering situation couldnt account couldnt prepare advance make difficult next impossible try predict accident occur say safer average thats really comforting know people never accident entire life probably never accidentputting someone like situation computer could potentially mess actually making dangerous le
actually enjoy driving get car could drive id still want ability drive
people like driving people hate sitting traffic traveling long distance dont think people want crap
think different area drive fun dont think trade life safety people fun driving
modprog give ability move freely exchange slightly safety ultimately driver mostly control nah
treelineresearch wouldnt autonomous car still give freedom meant le safety passangers car safety pedestrian cyclist way likly get injured killed even behave correctly
treelineresearch right endanger people
really dont see people hostile thought autonomy vehicle car bus train tram even ship aeroplane wrote research paper safety concern around autonomous vehicle professional opinion concern autonomous vehicle cybersecurity aspect legalethical liabilityresponsibility issue latter solved easily like everything else legal system former already issue decade doubt autonomous vehicle best way ensure safe expeditious movement vehicle
driverless elevator ever struggled understand traffic cone
ok boomer
youll ever know accident hid medium trusted

lose personal agency thanks man
driverless car emitting lidar plan fill road car differentiate lidar wave car lidar
make wonder could build jammer police lidar speed trap machine
people disgusting long think car come pick work someone dropped steamer seat
explaining lidar thought two car wouldnt mess lidar
beegestyoshi work frequency thats lidar work car know signal pick one send returning signal another car sent
lidar spin sends laser one particular slice full circle light come back matter microsecond lens capture bounced light quite small two lidar exact sync unlikely produce single point beam point doesnt hit lens therefore produce result would filtered standard usage lidar sometimes pick noise laser might hit fly falling leaf small disturbance around might bounce back prematurely need kind filtering cleaning sanity checking going would make sort cross interference matter sum unlikely laser another lidar happens hit lens another would produce one erroneous point million per second case would similar laser beam picking unfortunate insect air thus algorithm must able handle anyway
really vastly oversimplified airplane analogy im major airline pilot tell many time simply choice override automation errorsglitches etc crash cited asiana partly due failure automation aircraft function expected specifically auto throttle system
inform get kinda mislead video know waymo fully autonomous selfdriving car take anywhere waymo car drive road road first mapped processed car allowed drive raod car know every th inch whole street way dont worry anything else thing moving people car strategy work quite well suburb probably pretty well bigger city well youd extremely detailed map entire earth able take road trip ever want look x better tesla sensor cause need know correlating premapped world given new road road construction especially therefor also one downside strategy since car doesnt know enviroment doesnt corelate map tesla trying full autonomy real time map environment surroundings actively find safest yet quickest route destination hope cleared thing
great vid tho show potential waymo take uber section taxi driving suburb larger city
obviously pretty much eliminate human driving asap bit miffed video claimed driverless car reduce traffic without addressing induced demand problem even mentioning weve known year best way solve traffic good public transit alternative driving guess point rather goal getting driverless car road getting humandriven private car road city need dont need selfdriving taxi much need bustrain network selfdriving otherwise walkable design working cycle infrastucture
want remain control vehicle thank much
waymo cut got ta go office flip someone oh dont forget wear stupid face square
c see vehicle working good city example live maine road rural poorly maintained time pothole debris road lot sand road snow ice lot twist turn blind spot moose curious vehicle would preform especially winter
sorry hate idea self driving car couldnt give flying fudge autonomous vehicle better human computer also better everything die let computer take world world commerce becoming totally internet based le busy world becomes violent become lack purpose people feel boredom excessive luxury going demise obvious depression larger problem ever doesnt mean im sure everyone say im wrong
waiting end video comment something like cgp grey entered chat showed clip haha human need apply might one best video internet
lidar going work longterm atleast according elon musk waymo car cost toooo much super expensive lidar approach work prerecorded area tesla approach able drive anywhere
doesnt go brap brap shoot flame
cant wait autonomous car drive best surrounded autonomous car
problem idea theoretically crazy synchronised driving practice would require trust programming car dont want bug would mean every single ai need developed company oversight central authority something go wrong inertia thing cant immediately readjust even car autonomous would still need drive good margin error
kamilot wouldnt say every car ai need developed company long substantial amount experience proven safe follow road rule might bug imagine would show car approved would trust programming car would trust human road company future agree collectively use ai would probably best sure bunch different ai driver million hour driving coexist road least better human
huonsmith car really proven safe theoretical guarantee well neural network performs mathematical certainty safety car gather empirical data make statistic idea making selfdriving car communicate seems dangerous could bug error propagate communication car open possibility mass accident selfdriving car commit accident simultaneously possibility really exists car controlled single program communicating would really try keep behavior selfdriving car independent programming error propagate one car another ideally selfdriving car independently trained neural network keep behavior selfdriving car independent much believe perform better human let communicate possible perform accident human crowd could ever perform
myreneario well car proven safe sure something developed prevalence self driving car increase mean literally test human determines whether drive sure wont difficult develop parameter test driverless car communication problem dont know anything programming could see potential error occuring one car would send incorrect information another cause crash know nothing programming also dont see much necessity independently trained neural network cloning one neural network plugging every car seems fine unless something go wrong cloning process dont see problem long car driving car dont see car couldnt share information back base neural network could build collective experience others like naruto training shadow clone jutsu
get accident battery fire burn beyond recognition require gallon put fire get waterlol good luck
computer never make mistake instance people think computer making mistake caused accident hardware failure human fault computer encounter problem wasnt coded resolve designer programmer fault computer exactly told time really trusting engineer assembled car programmer told concern one thing test sure multiple self driving car time dont know much lidar work lazer beam may interfiere self driving car mirror self driving car responds siren criminal exploit ignore engineer programmer human error still equation unless car self driving coded protect pedestrian car skateboarder dog cat tell difference running dog bag plastic flying road
zero percent chance ever get driverless car never happen
walking riding bike friend going happen public cry get dangerous thing ever put car removed human driver
lkeil lifetime wont least live
given choice id rather train high speed rail everywhere way easier automate way safer pollutes le cause le traffic downside greatly outweighed benefit everyone need public transportation
person elevator even press button
id like high speed rail network please
quick question someone make fake siren noise trick car move would happen car smarter
would face scan send prosecutor
im wary self driving think unsafe per se im wary thing come alongside feeling well thinking like u internet yes made thing accessible also greatly reduced thing like kid actually going outside playexplore also curious concept owning car disappear well company rent autonomous car
year public transport fancy way mingling realm human traffic solution called far dangerous whatever adaption made word dont think actual future long run
shill
really one dimensional video
mrgriff displaying car mode transport doesnt talk generalizability system display one brand making seem like one achieved milestone really bunch missing argue self driving car exactly like elevator people stupid overestimate ability
cant find parking
self driving car dont see would able manage europe construction site big european city want dont think yet
europe working getting le car public transit think best work mini taxi travel small distance
highly unlikely scenario end death drive decision truth people drink drive get home fine without killing innocent family yet take zero tolerance view rightly drinking driving le lifelong smoker develop lung cancer even fewer develop list cancer associated smoking yet taught smoking lead lung cancer full stop think commonality scenario horrific tragedy happen problem lie issue self driving vehicle mention lack accountability happen
think still lot niche event like ambulance one side someone running across freeway side situation sort one million still happen several time day across planet however think hit nail head statistically prove vehicle safer human able use dont need perfect better alternative continue improve probably incredible ten year right still generally require human wheel thats ok
stop telling want
let machine live life like born live die u hate going
wow didnt know driving life
honestly would le scary getting taxi first two minute im clenching start distract hope best actually think autonomous car would le scary
think people said tech yet probably country road infrastructure poor im city india honestly dont think road meant selfdriving car
windy road road faded line gravel road backing trailer seems plausible large city anything past dont think well see decade
prediction spinoff driverless car car sex lot car sex driving
human really good driving driving computer better paying attention getting data human cant
guy full disclosure waymo sponsored aka im getting paid talk good waymo b autonomous lidar thats like person wear bifocalsin rain snow lidar cant see well condition google know trying beat tesla making autonomous lane detroit project cavnue google work mediocre technology didnt get paid tell truth human life stake level nothingremember ubervolvo vehicle autonomous killed person low speed wasnt level wiki elaine herzberg google case
tesla real solution coming training wheel high resolution gps map solve autonomy every road
real question much cost extra
happens day vehicle get hacked hijacked side world hacked see camera view whats happening around car truck bus hijacking truck hazardous material creating huge pileup middle big city killing million
excited completely ready driverless car also enjoy driving worry insurance law first see driverless safety bonus therefore discount rate morph penalty anyone dare drive vehicle itll depressing unexciting day happens
thats fine phoenix im still waiting explanation automated car would work minnesota ice snow fog etc night
car doesnt care dark foggy creates electromagnetic wave lidar
vlyer lidar bounce light object water droplet air rain fog particulate matter dust smoke absolutely make lidar useless ice snow fully partially blocking lidar would car clean air quality great lidar paint accurate picture surroundings
michaeltorrisi oh yes totally shouldnt included fog point still stand dark
people like driving want car fully autonomous taxisbusestrucks make sense doubt eliminate owner driven vehicle
time whrn human allowed drive
still feel many fix automated car provide applied public transport well decrease automotive death corresponds increase use public transportation decrease car traffic building better road also better way car related death stop able design city geared pedestrian instead big hunk metal going mile per hour many needle death would stop
cgp grey animation totally disregard fact pedestrian exists crutial autonomous driving spread becomes perfect ballet city administration may consider dropping trafic light pedestrian supossed move around also sucessful autonomous driving increase traffic efficiency lead increased demand consequence street crowded air polluted even electric car since electric power generated via fossil fuel many place im saying autonomous driving bad im saying lot factor taken account like veritasium min video seems overly positive ad
seen video like five year ago
driverless car forever prone carjacking humanother driverless car issue also guy bribed way spewing totally factual information video trump
people garbage driving computer better time time think human better need something youre normally supposed like tree fall across road get around kinda drive sidewalk youre stuck confusing parking lot badnonexistent signage figure get driving entrance fact think probably wont long illegal manually drive citiestowns dangerous
phrase always oclock world maybe probably oclock somewhere world true probable many time day week happen earth general easy count think
wanted driverless long time finally power nap transit point b
minute long commercial nice
parking lot outside town autonomous inside town im
think detrimental video sponsored company makesuses autonomous car
well obvious mention leader self driving technology
seems work fine carcentric town carcentric country like america im sure city large number pedestrian cyclist appropriate place though although place dont need car driverless otherwise
bad weather ie crosswind kt gust absolutely want plane fly want expirienced pilot abort approach judge safe land plane referring bad weather low visibility perfectly fine autopilot system relies il guide towards runway threshold
im curious intend work self driving car bad weather especially snow rain would trust self driving weather sunny day certainly bad weather
trust human crappy weather vehicle measurably hundred time safer bad weather feel road superhuman vision react instantly loss grip road hydroplaning icy surface
hmmi agree driverless car sponsored actual driver le car company come man
autonomous vehicle road make mistake like human question lee fewer fetal accident insurance go
thats dream
eleanor sophia theyre still safer human driving car
notice almost commenters pro selfdriving car talk people real world much people prefer driving enjoying think discovered ad dont work anymore better way swing people opinion buying something making read positive comment noticed similar thing electric car search anything negative ev google youtube even quora notice biased result favour ev
im waiting technology mind commences judgment day
mean like people shoot school mall
id say want driverless car replace normal car carcentric development extremely bad society many way purely road accident furthermore public transport already achieves nearly everything driverless car mention cheaper sustainable lead humancentred development city best car car
yeah good tech highway disastrous development good city
one day safety regulation would let manually control car would take one exciting pleasurable experience would really really sad day could imagine driving sunset empty country road sunday evening yes maybe monkey behind wheel monkey least leave u joy
come theyre called driverless car instead autoautos
man asking real question
still better smartphone
dude
auto
mean technically automobile would still work right
imagine selfdriving car uber carpool system basicaly street would become like individual public transport
fully believe self driving car though didnt think technology evolved yet however main fear self driving car hasnt answered video traffic respond self driving car much easier make one self driving car respond another especially share training even know advance car approach headed route interaction self driving car human said pedestrian hit self driving car stationary stationary suddenly stop human driver would noticed danger continued sped whatever self driving car respond situation differently human throw human traffic driver traffic could also aggravate cause human behave dangerously question safe self driving car mixed human traffic fully believe self driving car drive safely human percentage self driving car need road safety gain ideal importantly today low percentage self driving car make road dangerous due human making error result id love hear response waymo similarly knowledgeable company better yet followup video going issue thanks reading
sound intelligent making statement use computer however would provide cursory instance computer fail tantamount ridiculous simply put trust computer absolute said computer compromised logic board fully understanding situational awareness component case computer relys perform function examine closely watch aircraft crash investigation recently human intervention prevented crash simple computer control lost ability fly another computer malfunctioning component human take survive still stronger human computer module computer turned human turned understand concept computer turned back living least concept living available computer yet simply return living state flick button simply adding electricity right component much human eh flying airplane driving car like riding elevator person go car airplane still consideration consider least moment even faa recognize computer may good flying circumstance behave better human case computer fine many thing people still build computer people fail computer time distant future suspect computer control human civilization may occur right even stated overheard car ultimately controlled agent sitting terminal somewhere monitoring vehicle currently passenger true false
dont like video predictionsimplication easy make still machine make many fault open world also dont trust manufacturer cost involved cant deny future costly normal people hate future hope dont need participate unwillingly
car stole nasty people
make like actual driving car simplest thing like greeting entering confirming location go etc
hackable though
driver think average think pet peeve pointing correct mathematically speaking four driver three two star five one zero star average star
youre right think larger data set phenomenon wouldnt pronounced
compjelly true gaussian distribution instance sure driver ability distributed maybe everybodys bad except driver elite
backing still dangerous maneuver
would love auto car road long cant hacked oh wait
driverless car really cool really awesome long traveling taxilike situation think get rid personalized transportation part resource inefficient big city public transportation system expanded everyone able use driverless bus could play important role number vehicle adjusted immediately respond higher demand personalized transportation banned city suburban area redesigned shop minute walkable range everyone community interconnected public transport calling selfdriving car last resort get anywhere
world greatest driver long idiot road
thought perfect still progress left combination self driving car public transportation way maximize efficiency issue rising cyber security issue require something done sure
here problem robbery people become easy target possession abduction
youd think travel pass becoming global norm would thought tech actually used literally borderline dystopian stuff already see restricted area common folk wont able access simply limit autonomous vehicle ok people want option definitely come time people regret giving ability control vehicle scenario people relate govt imposes lockdown implement restricted area autonomous car unable leave locked area designated caregiver individual need assistance unable access family well car simply cant leave restricted area attempt contact govt useless bureaucracy need wait week possibly month get case resolved granny doesnt get pill time doesnt make looking forward future
dont trust engineer programmer make decision going fast desk week month past end story
guess
expect human better particularly tough situation dont understand would expect tough situation worst
missed important point current state art autonomous vehicle work predetermined route many issue trying use vehicle new route ive worked deep learning side tech really difficult get thing properly detected example even lane detection isnt good outside highway said great potential even get working highway around world
trust technology trust science general good theory long there human involved cant trust completely let talk ethical dilemma trust car gon na programmed run cliff detect someone wrong opinion riding sound silly look china social score possibility control endless another example le extreme pandemic technology widespread covid totally see agent state requesting car refused drive prevent people leaving home could even authoritarian already make car ai locked behind cryptography completely reach people ideology bias trust
cant wait please larger city everywhere dont like drive night highway regardless day night would good order car app get tell car go arrive destination timely fashion got feeling current driverless car drive certain city specific area send onto gravel sand road wood work
talk plane automated accident pilot im curious there report many time pilot intervene automation screwing ive dealt quite bit
anyone tell title keep changing
hit motorcyclist withwithout helmet hit one wrong aka overtaking without yielding oncoming trafic least considering example
impressive still system lidar etc seem work much towards planar open landscape wide single purpose road ubiquitous breakdown lane etc look chandler arizona online map look like made one computer game almost completely rectangular city plan probably drive locking either longitude latitude time wonder would work topology like part san francisco andor cramped closely built historical city europe organically grown city plan sort complex fork turn underpass ramp tunnel oneway lane street shared tramway pedestrian zone multilevelmulticontext signage mixed scene car panicbraked front guy cart live bern switzerland scene would probably happen every hundred meter youd probably need lot barf bag household dont car included get many many pedestrian lot public transport absolute right way many smaller street pedestrian bicycle right way across child allowed play street car supposed veeery slowly slalom around kid toy hockey goal etc
kinda disappointing technology right make entire network driverless safer yet wont happen struggling ai adequately predict human action road ai becomes irrelevant car road also driverless get driverless car need solve problem exists lack adoption car driver stupid unpredictable
aside someone doesnt live city would still like car
absolutely awesome love driving
autonomous vehicle great mix human autonomous vehicle going nasty problem mostly sociopolitical aspect agree year
something thats got ta asked would handle trolley problem
think thats question make human worry time real world traffic trolley problem situation human would probably hesitate panic find bad solution time situation car already started precautionary sequence trolley wont reach either target
imma fully trust hahahha
cynicism got second technology recorded sound like record ill pas driverless car thx
like old discussion self driving car comprehensive enough neither discussion focus soley safety expect public sell sport car motorcycle hell even bicycle ai car safest thing also issue attention span self driving car lidar system require someone attentive wheel like pilot attentive plane autoland example giving people task expecting continuously monitor autopilot system great idea opinion person steer car able remain focused longer one thing carsickness personally know le prone becoming car sick driving thing flying aerobatic pilot give control plane lessen motion sickness also little outthere ai driving around go hal definitely utility found automated car arent replacement every vehicle road
jessica sweety hotgirl vlogs ok stuff wrote vehicle like bike attention span motion sickness putting blind faith ai sit actively monitor autopilot going put sleep faster driving
driving around road purchased designed car
afaik man elons promised debut date way past much id like car drive home drink umm system cant read road sign interpret stop light yet whatever avoiding people
fair people dont stop see sign time ran red light realize red
true least would clearly responsible error consequence see comment owns error
spykezspykez ever control company tell system perfect actively monitor watch something wrong nothing error system claimed hand free time something wrong error part
percent people think average well people pretty good driver average percent may well right
many people workjust doesnt mean
someone capable driving awesome technology much convenience lazy people need life want lay bed loosing ability basic function guess enjoy driving give
several lifetime fully replaces driver need make technology kit installed million car already exist
ready within decade stuff evolves faster people kid
asking driverless car hit situation ask first whats right answer human driver situation cant see difference situation thus ethic problem robot car specifically
subway would never get situation like
people complain wrong thing driverless car safer bt problem driver going loose job problem going tell big deal want remind people driver job job going disappear coming year unlikely able create enough job people
also really annoying comment deleted paste back dont know responsible need stop really annoying check every single comment make
big question vehicle cover scenario would ridiculous simple task done car program handle keep mind give away control vehicle except stop button example car probably never go speed limit even emergency requires get away tornado someone need urgently medical care feature exist abused way vehicle decide emergency certainty car always abused hacked hater small example imagine someone blasting bluetooth speaker siren stop entire traffic car suggesting car stop sound happens road official map vehicle us sign andor road badly drawn doesnt make sense idiot designed road drunk highly doubt car understands enviroment great even producer claim wouldnt trust claim always uncharted road place offroad might want go car like forest newly built road dont get wrong im im saying probably ready yet dont mean safety standard fine would love see list scenario like solution fully autonomous vehicle scenario least could solved future actual feature yet like believe good driver dont believe anyone would chose self driving car unless worst case scenario covered general people think good driver concerned safety driving since vehicle currently self driving wont see point change yet
people shy dont like talking uber driver love
massive employment catastrophe incoming
think video asks wrong question become invested individual transportation method mass transit efficient environmentally friendly transportation weve given much country road lot space could used green space community garden pedestrianfriendly path much conversation focus individualized private solution profitable corporation whats profitable isnt necessarily need need focus public infrastructure also privacy issue private company sending car collecting data privacy law weak u corporate giant lobby keep way eye get world learn u predict behavior learn manipulate u buying stuff often know u better know point understand need pay bill also think accepting sponsorship private company operating area conflict interest even work something dont make particular demand feature product still bias favor know would damage ability get sponsorship dont feature sponsor good light
dont know lot people would lose job
next video showing ride autonomous car want night snow storm cant even see icy road
ive riding bicycle almost year stopped taking hand bar reached age knowing better also fly plane comparison plane landing autonomously low visibility situation car driving autonomously road false comparison plane land runway controlled area car drive time uncontrolled environment believe world full unpredictable driver animal natural disaster autonomous vehicle able outperform agree time smart vehicle use autonomous car superior human driver autonomous vehicle would win every indy nascar race would love travel alone sleep back vehicle maybe long im dead autonomous car superior never take hand wheel long live
think thing dont trust driverless car implementation effectiveness sensor use trust computer make correct decision programmed necessarily able detect fringe case pedestrian animal highway case one autonomous vehicle didnt see semi trailer either colormaterial trailer position relative sensor wasnt wrong decision lack sensing lot human thinking good driver mostly focus pretty intensely whenever im driving definitely feel became aware surroundings threat prediction motorcycle driving im also constantly aware see one two thing time still surprised pretty easily depending fringe case trust autonomous vehicle excellent sensor implementation human much likely aware given threat time computer doesnt exactly attention span like
mean simple weather one thing white snow black ice fog thing together
youd think sponsored video theyd give derek car doesnt keep saying oil change required sound like human error though cant fault robot overlord
test car india would trust
guy step front car parking lot another robs kidnaps control harmed car run dumb as front car call cop
anyone else excited actually like drive
oh yes much fun stuck traffic going mile hour work back start go faster cut throte tactic like warfare much fun
youre going see human nature make transition driverless vehicle bit slow even though human piloted vehicle incredibly dangerous fueled dangerous combustible chemical people ignore danger see accident side road oh well guy dumb whatever normalize danger however single driverless car involved accident omg thing soo dangerous theyre ready road yet even though accident rate far lower human driver youll also note kind accident autonomous vehicle immediately blasted news sometimes nationally always talked news ignores hundred accident human driven car occur daily mostly given city get mentioned accident cause traffic delay road closure
driverless lift comparable driverless car obviously lift dont kill much people car back
car sarcastically mumble go ahead like right way anything
wont ego driven like human
miss something zero mention geofencing
ive watched silicon valley trust im never riding thing life
important remember people fiction dont act like human whatever screenwriter want ive watched office dont understand economic didnt crash already
adoption increase confidence handle edge case snow roadworks troll purposely interfering id love know theyre going floor shot bang smashing glass indicate pull away confidently stop sign
talking driverless car without even mentioning tesla pure vision approach oh yeah forgot sponsored video
pure vision wont work camera eye theyre worse
robertcubm ur wrong
firecraftentertainment ur
aviation much simpler action automate see everyday passenger willing take airplane without pilot might believe selfdriving car actually going thing yet
number one reason airplane crash anyone pilot error
problem work road around specific area something work everywhere technology underdeveloped road smaller also fact car company like tesla right thinking making subscription model work optimal condition road near place people fix anything break long way operational everywhere compare airtravel driving car like video strict rule regulation travel airplane take commercial airliner joy ride one country another unless mean supposed drive x oclock random thing back selfdriving car road around way road road good speed limit kmh half lane often back let car past self driving car shown really bad road anything go wrong either water depending exactly meter deep mountainside headon collision car car proven work well willing back needed situation forth starting get driverless car able drive lane highway going straight close team people able help car make right choice reality driverless car going common everyone easier make car whole team behind work function whole team behind every single car road remotely monitoring like
right car company escape liability due accident arent driver driver almost always fault selfdriving car change equation word selfdriving car better nearly flawless company deep pocket
going dont need road people live gravel road crumbling pavement doesnt lane marking anymore everyone life suburb city actually navigate old fashioned way go north mile got gravel road middle open field lidar going know road im saying reason driverless car shouldnt exist saying shouldnt expect driverless car u still enjoy driving seek older simpler car dont computer way feeling driving people take joy feeling connected road without computer interpreting experience enjoy driving usually much safer better driver average person way
people gon na late ever go cause car set obey speed law
waymo logo reminded weylandyutani corporation logo
year ago cousin promised china would become world largest economy within year im saying thing dont eventually happen im saying thing always take time think
car wont drive city town next year government neglected fix pothole allow spot pothole technology live report government revolution dont forget marking fading tree blocking sign stoplight wrongly programmed
car one potential future wow like anxiety car
literally think brain think multiple future reason car behavior becomes dysfunctional usually due trauma environmental factor call anxiety treat like problem
cutebabyseal thats interesting
computer handle high anxiety situation well machine correctly built carefully coded think quitting driving helped lower blood pressure used love driving year anxiety love driving every bus ride like los angeles tour without tour guide feel bit empathy computer coded heavy responsibility require liquid cooling lol
cutebabyseal treated problem getting rid vehicle cannabis edible requires much le caffeine get much better sleep
well like already see someone pushing cart like car anticipate going cross crosswalk car braked suddenly result human wouldnt seems derek advertising waymo making critical judgement
always focused one task driving number one reason car become fully autonomous
like driving know capability like car extention body thats like like know capacity human become even physically dont get wrong there time want drive ill want use feature also like race dont want autonomous car racing edit year racing driving know believe better driver matter fact ive dodged crash people front avoided foolish driver create crash avoided mistake ive trained know know im better know best friend belief good driver there thing make better thought make feel better need know difference
id happier developed country people dont believe try tell jaywalking real thing
sci fi novel overlycrowded alien casually walked across lane highway overlycrowded vehicle overlycrowded highway somehow managed avoid possible collision used video showed intersection city southeast asia dense mass mostly small moped going direction avoiding collision forgot video fix bug like random runner chasing ball street crazy traffic situation similar random shtuff accident likely accident much le human driver level machine accident acceptable level
""
camera multiple lidar achieve autonomy tesla think theyll crappy camera worse picture dashcam
main reason accident happen driving license given easily there minor physical checkup every year regardless id gladly see half driver replaced live commute people think roundabout lefthanded crossroad insane really
eg kid run blind spot get hit driverless car who charge kid parent owner car engineer designed car software engineer
automated car road safer would could share data
dumb need walk parked car understand moving great speed able stop walking car
actually people average driving possible mathematically even likely
yes lot bad driver make average human driver seem absolutely horrible unfortunately easy kick terrible driver road good talking measure average quality driver number quality driver
apodski yeah exactly would median
ahhhh yeah greece kind car major successmost definitely see incredibly masculine greek men driver actually ready sit back enjoy driverless ride
lidar fool errand elon musk
like drive im opposed there autonomous driver hole shot dude next hey car think take guy really got pansy get record instrument rating fairly common instrumentation ga pilot shoot approach ga general aviation btw cat iii approach showed lot lower relatively speaking
autonomous vehicle take one owns autonomous vehicle separate class auto insurance individual clearly liability dramatically reduced vehicle ownerdriver arent prone speeding making wrong turn driving red light stop sign etc two autonomous vehicle road one behind ought able communicate automatically negotiate lane change vary speed might allow tailgate one another perhaps saving energy
hmm video feel way like indictment poor public transit system u mean sleep watch something phone train bus
crammed sardine people
im fully board driverless human terrible driver human best creativity want car right
cant wait fully autonomous car available country love idea visiting friend snoozing way home also may cynical trust technology human day human become overconfident angry impatient distracted aggressive drunk bully driver passenger car driven extremely angry man terrified honest id rather passenger driver drunk
crazy people think least year away
probably depends people live theyre well outside major metropolitan area even educated capable people hard time navigating area term road loose description yes technology probably year away
dangerrangerlstc oh yeah agree guess poll vague considered mean people considered technology general would decade away regardless whether specific area could deploy
people definitely bad driving excellent driver say absolute certainty
cop give ticket
thats great sure programmer car wont make algorithm bias towards putting people life danger often particularly people aligned leftist political idea people woke cultist know prevalent politics silicon valley particularly google owns waymo
seriously think theyll car crash kill people right company would providing service would sued negligence least theyd pay large amount money family died wouldnt even worth company looking make bigger profit
showakusai except itll impossible prove court based complex algorithm im also programmer know limit big tech company put resource towards goal
think people voted tech isnt didnt mean literally think gon na awhile self driving car legalized affordable general public top buying one general assume repair cost gon na astronomical thats bad considering car already financial obligation public still tech amazing great eliminate automobile death car pain as general id rather see investment public transport instead tech company pouring money
bring
driverless car distraction move sustainable way living flooding around world show week resilience face climate disaster unfolding maintain status quo nothing pollution social justice quality life pedestrian safety public health
im self driving car long either publicly owned corporately owned fleet vehicle ive seen way people maintain personal vehicle currently id venture guess privately owned vehicle road driving around check engine light tire worn point unsafe critical part drivetrain patched together glue tape even couple back sensor stopped working truck month saying really get around replacing imagine one many system critical sensor self driving car im saying manager corporation dont thing much easier hold account oversite regulation public agency corporation typically nearly limitless access fund afford operate completely red least private citizen find situation either fix car buy food way access enough fund maintenance always end deferred least certain percentage car owner basically im getting love idea autonomous vehicle long maintained always operating correctly reason dont think truly autonomous vehicle work consumer product current capitalist economic structure cant count individual responsibility reason google employee put makeup fell asleep behind wheel human judgment fallible mean certain technology always require oversite ensure used properly trying limit anyones freedom fact life note isnt knock capitalism per say recognition one situation well equipped handle least technology becoming consumer product privately owned vehicle regulated capitalism well suited bringing tech market service offered regulated corporation ie taxi service reason commercial airplane work well automated system
honestly definitely right concerned ive check engine light car year never fixed would hope yearly inspection could help mitigate issue know plenty place dont thorough job would happily support corporate public fleet vehicle itd convenient
imagine flow traffic autonomous vehicle
would like one scene bee movie
impressive technology waymo openplan office warehouse look like terrible work environment honest
long heated cooled reasonably quiet individual morale motivation interest work make work environment good bad
pauleohl fair enough suppose still startup phase sense trying run lean im worried performance controller openplan office conducive focused work
mrgriff really cant handle criticism isnt even directed im surprised extrapolate single comment judgment entire person im programmer worked openplan office everyone wear headphone distracting missioncritical work like assume controller would prefer quiet comfortable environment work make fewer mistake said another reply assume final version facility presumably still working startup mode positive nondepressing day
mrgriff wow seems default ad hominem instead actually addressing comment also said found technology impressive anyway better day
mrgriff second first posted
best thing autonomous car follow rule never speed blow stop sign illegal thing driver constantly sociopathic driver culture normalised also autonomous car suffer situational blindness affect driver whereby even driver looking car fail see bicycle right front technology moral imperative embrace autonomous vehicle move towards banning human driving
ride bike take bus subway car asshole
everyone access bus subway like know right everyone life nyc
showakusai everyone access bike lack public transportation thats problem car cant drive car ruined city working towards taking back driverless car nothing fight climate change
idea make people lazy
fatal accident quote google reacg waymo accidnts saying eliminate fatality saying best way reduce chance serious injury would take evasive maneuver possible victor said waymo actually identified fatal accident time period study didnt reconstruct allmar
perspective self driving car wont thing least passenger flight get fully autonomous technically far easier achieve yet didnt happen sure seems waymo mastered autonomous driving car one city perfect weather condition clean road layout etc try car software vietnam well talk
cant wait see car nyc cabbie mode sometimes need chirp horn push way certain merges happens driverless car scenario seems would sit wait forever
yep one reason get human behind wheel
probably mentioned video waymo car limited pretty small area actually work
thats awfully relevant expanding range experience environment big unknown might easy american city would delighted easy country cynic expects require lot time get expanded data set validate real world road mile acid test insurance premium driverless cost human driver premium thats good enough validation
thats super cool maintenance wouldnt go far smooth tire driverless apart im absolutely board
regular car surely whether car driverless doesnt change maintenance thing like tyre
still make driving way safer u
ultimate question car safer hmmm let check nope doesnt check
great analytical skill einstein
beginning there admission depends ideal road condition would work everywhere elevator story prof nothing relies ton complex gadget subject entropy potentially sabotage car gadget high value target relies software equipment run neither ever fail yet subject entropy potentially sabotage software car common high value target external gadget safety relies would need able resist disaster condition incl gun violence etc order useful critical moment occur life tend greatest impact people systematically oppressed thing far except make car le accessible people living impoverished area become common poor people always make due janky used model doesnt always work right testing ai accuracy good thing doesnt resolve question safety use anyone afford car maintenance want go work properly
want possible two different thing
real question buy one car
im worried hacking software perfect world look great
government crash car disagree
like smith movie driverless car finally scifi becomes real
oh derek ive played delamain mission know end
lel
yup cake lie
lol
imagine driverless police car every car ahead car would go side every single car would driver le car would get way
first thing first comment nothing second replying comment third stop torturing cant leave good comment without replying advertising porn
open seating plan control hub look like noisy agoraphobic nightmare
lot big company started following suit served make lot unhappy people really bit as pandemic hit
hacking
one welcome new selfdriving overlord
technology ready politician
ah get ai car cyberpunk
also car automated itll get easier ai car lol
tech trust people road unpredictability coincides fullfledged essentially car road communicate directly
issue car liability there accident who faultthe car softwarehow current law going adapt
dott think fully autonomous car thing work worst possible condition sure nice dandy perfect environment thats half challenge opinion issue human error still stand autonomous vehicle programming vehicle people responsive accident thinking computer work perfectly naive another question responsible something happens mean must manufacturer car company going take risk
functional reliable
sudden stop though bit odd best option faultless one
imagine car hive logic
cant wait see technology advance example see self driving car handle orlando fl rush hour traffic
car autonomous absolutely without issue however sadly deal idiotic unpredictable human
police officer manning intersection since stop light would car able respond officer signal accordingly
mind got changed
yes driverless car linked grid longer autonomy vehicle sound amazing im sure pure hearted government never take advantage people
main reason people driving worse lack real driving youth prolific bunch driving sim game give false confidence younger driver win virtual track believe often natural skill forget driving road full time dangerous get distracted virtual driving forgiving error make u complacent id love autonomous electric vehicle
million job driver engineer least think life may save well life may ruin
already see remember good ol day actually drove car
definitely going happen imo soon autonomous car get common statistic show pretty much accident caused human driver long impossible avoid banning human driving much safer think itll probably stay legal road property although well get point people dont know drive anymore
danieljensen thats great thing many many people deserve able drive vast majority dont follow even law yet think good driver one example law using turn signal always making lane change turn alone get rid like driver thats conservative imo
good ol day hahahaha
reiwalexy would help insurance company raised rate offered reduction using good driving app behavior changed dramatically started using insurance company app need massive stick get average people change bigger carrot dont think rate reduction work based many aholes encounter daily minute drive work
danieljensen well get point people dont know drive future old man already
self driving car perfect assassinating people accidentally purpose
good idea imagine thing get hacked
problem see way around hacking driverless car criminal government even elon thought happening dangerous see combination driver assist tech need stand alone modular passive certainly live connected network expert opinion
yknow horse already autonomous
drove across u first time year driver way annoying
want driverless car road much simplistic approach fact want driverless car anyone retired way make happen designing driverless car hoping best qualified electrical engineering patented invention made many unique device served apprenticeship rd unique suitable control system engineering skill understand self driving car remain incredibly practical earth many people like world retired good luck making self driving car work already promised self driving car hey maybe year maybe year time take penny drop realise qualified people like already knew year ago people like employed would self driving car road year ago problem technical problem car way practical thing different method consider much bigger project designing driverless car happens snowing camera see snow torrential rain hail camera tell difference dark damp patch shadow sink hole radar tell difference dangerous object road coke technical problem even solved people working project blind practical technical problem way ensure driverless car fail boy racer age going feel many boy racer politician make decision car become driverless happen driving instructor driving test examiner taxi driver need sat navs manufacturer say road map street map longer needed technology always deteriorates within year car start crashing getting lost road mapping quality deteriorates criminal government hack driverless car crash assassinate opposition considering percent population technical ignoramus public protect car take shopping shop search engine want go restaurant pay system driverless car nightmare control enslave steal independence take money company make sub standard product take money steering towards paid commercial fleecing node anyone complains car mysteriously crash high speed
still get big kick driver le car company driving nice wide street rain snow pothole homeless people asking money road rage driversunmarked detour knocked safety cone police emergency vehicle shoulder broken stoplightsthat require way matter way stop drunk driver merging texas interstate south waco rainstorm shopping mall private roadway semi flooded underpass navigate someone airport departure drop major metropolitan airport would like pick drive time day see well someplace perfect southwestern desert cant drive safely without without sometimes breaking rule put code bad outcome liable last one driver want mess one behind wheel know blocking charging station chain strong weakest link
dont forget people dont often clean car sensor camera would dirty
phone warns there smudge lens
im pretty sure car tell cant see sensor camera tell clean wont go
wont owning car wont klaus schwab world economic forum already told nothing happy
there sensor
waymo instead pro driver trust javascript developer
give new meaning following word im human
dont put blame
country like india dont deserve atlist next year become driver still profession
nah possible atleast city need separate normal road road people walk basically fence road make illegal manually drive self driving car autonomous fully safe need signal efficient
prajwal also old area think
houseplanner old area become new china anything go india need million people city planning would make possible
prajwal long subject debate one line chinese people flexibility government india flexible government super flexible people
ideally society civilization could built without car necessary major metropolis area since didnt happen believe moral imperative get technology perfected norm soon possible save many life
kind people need selfdriving driver physically challenged elderly n youger people time spend backseat leisurely adult cant wait
cheaper ofc mean look tesla like cheaper pay dozen engineer high tech one driver right
like inside alien spaceship coming country time soon
funny people resist selfdriving car algorithm cant solve trolley problem problem popularised fact human cant solve
seen many big tech company server going vehicle take care server breakdown
driverless car dont necessarily need connect outside server unless theyre downloading software update like tesla function breakdown computer chip attached self driving car dangerous computer chip attached nonself driving car drivebywire technology computer chip reading position throttle brake pedal telling engine brake pad road since catastrophic failure drivebywire chip would pretty much exact effect
blame verizon et al trying use sdc hype g creating misconception believe edge computing norm exception since everything car neural net easily run mobile class cpu company typically latencynoncritical application run inference server easier deploy update keep net proprietary
one thing wonder impact public transit driverless car amazing still space inefficient require dedicated roadway suburb fine wonder impact congestion city benefit multiple people share car feel like low cost people
saw minute promotional video private establishment
thouse worried winter bad wether condition driving self driving car manage winter road better human soon thinking like thouse driver drive better average understand winterlidar see snow see snow thickness ice pot etc car milion mile experience winter driving dont lie derek showed plane landing austria
thats cool would way better invest way public transport rather driverless individual transport
yeah american really anything avoid building train certainly us tool used urban planner would much fear would amplify carcentric culture already ruining american city making unappealing alienating even derek say get rid carparks replace green space though couldnt done right proper public infrastructure
great video cant wait blind person travel suck id love access something many people take granted future could note term sponsorship waymo get edit approval get advance copy etc mr mobile awesome job
car road driverless traffic cease exist
hear car removed road road designed pedestrian train highspeed rail transport bunch people time
coconutgameshd people would never able get place directly reason car exist
pengudzn get public transit walk cycle take uber use microcar get destination
coconutgameshd u take uber car banned
pengudzn idiot thought uber used golf cart
want diverless card interior bed get sleep comfy ride car honk wake arrive
train cubicle sleep stuff
pessimist new tech wonder concrete problem autonomous driving aim address convenience driving democratization operating vehicle system raise variability optimum performance could imagine differently challenged child autonomous car damaged camera getting hit reckless driver ifelse make vehicle autonomous road become controlled environment launch autonomous driving really plan push toggle switch far complicated serious socioeconomic complexity even hypothetical scenario selfdriving vehicle solve dilemma dictate rule road adopt selfdriving current rule make new rule autonomous driving plane autonomous strong economic safety regulatory social benefit still pay pilot pay fortune qualify reason preventing accident although significant due reason avoidable driver error could valid reason substantiating one opinion cater exciting need specific sector customer business
smart road necessary make smart car better road communicate vehicle laser measurement part system also road sensor track path object hell yes stop light efficient driving much fewer accident
phoenix arizona unusual place almost never rain always warm hot road well maintained etc good place start rain snow mess lidar system pretty badly autonomous thing isnt coming major city year sure year operate london nyc stockholm call bald comment something else idk
part world extremely cool see neighborhood showing veritasium video close development waymo geographically see development vehicle everywhere driver sometimes lot time see around neighborhood parked waiting next pickup uber tried developing tried go fast playing catchup waymo algorithm eventually stopped development arizona waymo slow burn get amazing driver car long time even driving ai developed wanted way correct incorrect input love program would use car ride system
think main issue related autonomous car regarding random electronicssoftware failure mass production many quality factor involved device part assembly also many new failure point true quality manufacturing process increasing reliability new unknow problem susceptible discovered like virus affecting software electronic device problem due environment conditionslifetime expected
driving one question bigger question cost driving driverless car guess expensive buy car cost rent device afford rent car ereryday life
one thing feel like must implemented fully transition full autonomy vx communication vehicle surroundings would add even eye every vehicle also allow information processed object passing information road condition vehicle one example cameralidar difficulty seeing patch ice roadway another vehicle encountered vehicle know well
wont several lidar certain proximity interfere
might run different frequency
like riding bumper bumper quite literally speed limit google always know youll like future commuting experience essentially google eye sky commuter train home delivery think youll probably never car like itll provided exchange data travel music shopping ill stop
every video see self driving car sunny weather rain fog thunderstorm snowice maybe night dont get wrong want selfdriving car technology really capable dealing condition
ready driverless car suck as driving let computer finally nap im road
main concern driverless car bug software bug occurs flying plane take bug occurs driverless car going mph probably wouldnt know bug till collided something think pilot could tell bug long cause injury
there reason plane still pilot hit fan need someone take
onwards
mrhonordeath watched part dont agree totally reliant computer life stake pilot backup system case computer fails
sbespn idiosyncrasy
driverless car mean taxi driver public transport driver delivery driver hate people love expel people every kind job
agree however problem current system prioritize interest people capital ie owner company employ worker see selfdriving car positive would pay worker drive instead lived system allowed people rely lowpaying job survive day day making change removing taxi driver public transport driver delivery driver would severe consequence worker fact would net positive benefit safety wouldnt overshadowed consequence firing worker brought current capitalistic system
long possibly avoid self driving electric car general nothing reliable old chevy small block
pretty interesting idea need come infrastructure change like reducing car lane parking lot public transportation need prioritized imo solve many issue nowadays affect world population live large city full bad driving pedestrian casualty traffic jam result car stand around day could carpool autonomous vehicle could pretty great way reduce amount space money resource wasted vehicle standing around another change might necessary better emergency help since car dont care urgently need go somewhere wont break traffic rule generally good dangerous case
joke fear elevator
people arent good driver autonomous car also people developing software autonomous car
police want pull reason example police want arrest someone who inside car
rember car pulled heard siren would assume would
getting home bar drunk amazing future hop selfdriving car
take taxi night bus century ahead
realgbx guess speak usa people drive car bar would rather take home drunk carpool drunk friend leave vehicle behind pay big taxi fare
lakecityransom mean much people irresponsible
one good derek
cyberpunk billy
biggest problem av nonavs
car surely reduce road accident think future hacking car become problem
unfortunately current culture antiintellectualism widespread use driverless car probably become reality foreseeable future cant even get half country u get vaccine save life life others science considered belief par religion seems unlikely well get significant number people give muscle car jacked truck get law place mandate widespread use driverless car seems implausible
thats always thought safest driverless car surrounded driverless car work prevent mistakss
really matter many self driving car safer day one still human driver still problem
car amazing grid city suburb already look fantastic id really interested see work narrower winding road town city uk mainland europe maybe already good enough im sure itll get soon
pull side road cry losing delivery job kid go hungry
elevator plane dont need worry human thing walking front safety driver time selfdriving car would mess brings u biggest reason dangerous time selfdriving car self driving car arent safe enough support driver yet safety driver get bored perfectly fine driving therefore driver isnt prepared take time
fun cop start riding car license registration please
nothing happy
let daughter steer truck long driveway cant wait drive havent told yet time shes old enough drive wont steering wheel
derek amazing good video friend internet prerequisite keep coming waiting anxiously next one like potato chip cant consume one
selfdriving tesla autopilot recently went viral thought moon yellow stop light sure driverless car good enough road worthy sarcasm
wonder cause accident headline news
lkeil didnt cause accident cause concern
safe cool still sad day tell youre allowed pull antique car garage take drive sunday safety risk generation kid grows view old man want take old car spin selfish danger society
least car wont hackable year old kid
cinegraphics faith humanity rejuvenating
""
know accident arent people becoming reliant good car nowadays car better brake tyre etc give everyone basic car ltr economy box see there many accident
even number people died every year automated car currently peopledriven car would consider improvement least becomes problem actual solution
father truck driver concern may replaced computer one day big problem united state trucking industry lack driver feel like problem get worse itll push self driving commercial vehicle
sound good
autonomous car good profesional human driver better situation pedestrian mall parking lot car clearly used way much brake situation change senerio one similar parameter much higher speed say wet icy road use brake cause vehicle control professional driver understands use finesse able save vehicle occupant technology making good progress long way go achieve perfection
question car sickness start feel dizzy nauseous closed car roll window driverless car driver like dust getting car would robot driver mind rolling window
ive seen autonomous car hacked scene fast furious thats small concern fact would technically likely technically possible
saw movie godzilla real
side note machine learning perspective human extremely efficient learner compared computer instance show picture cat child show hundred different animal ask child shown picture cat machine learning need hundred thousand image train reliable network task also complex task becomes greater difference data provided human compared machine becomes driving road humandriven vehicle bicycle pedestrian sort weird situation extremely difficult task computer master uncountable number variable course need billion mile data probably machine successfully learn task hope fully selfdriven car safe get road soon possible wanted point machine year driving experience might accurate metric convince people machine experience
see future driverless car much safer human driver become standard human need apply special license allowed drive car would automatic liability road maybe wont even allowed drive
video would much better wasnt sponsored biased dissapointed crash autonomous vehicle show tesla one important selfdriving tech company
tesla us lithium battery need better infrastructure train
fit perfect social credit system
cool cool snow heavy rain
trust good driverless car dont trust something thats connected internet vulnerable cyber attack president riding fully autonomous mobile important worldly affair might get ride hacked would drive ditch
cool advert waymo bro
driverless car cool one interested edited selfie stick existence
selfie stick camera edits picture real time
passing stale red stop light mph know stale havent tasted
use nose
youre right light smell like burnt incandescents wonder lightbulb company lightbulb burn remind consumer change nobody want live house stinky light
even like agree stance autonomous car sponsorship topic lately made listening last couple video uncomfortable feel like wont know opinion end propaganda start
said key word ideal condition selfdriving isnt ready prime time wont lifetime
way like idea many ethical issue look computerphile talking ai ethic etc kid walk road car keep going kill kid turn run something kill passenger sacrifice one save many sacrifice many save one would want computer make decision like would live rest life put jail etc also skeptical something like would rural area ice snow gravel road etc honestly confidence riding horse would selfdriving car
know would probably generally sustainable people book driverless car trip le reason car le car needing made le car crash le car make space dont need worry parking cause itll drive without efficient driving shorter trip time might also result car road energy used driving around literally one car would really interesting see driverless car integrated public transit help reduce number car road well
dwight schrute thats ridiculous beat computer anyday
understand lot mean lot people hate driving happen really enjoy many people bothered put phone pay attention drive like accident happen thing fail fault automate something doesnt make better universal pay system place many people find job due increase automation get richer dont want pay automation striking elevator driver perfect example motivated money agree ability cut impaired distracted driver great want give control steering wheel would handle get somewhere emergency like getting injured person hospital
waymo autonomous car really safe road india hold speedbreaker
waymo least afaik relies quite lot precise mapping surrounging hd map obviously way dynamic street india good point
jparkerwillis theyre think autonomous car would change guess one seen street wonder already
automated driving make india make anywhere
stevves indian road improving lot faster year road match u europe quality
shivvbre highly highly doubt
felt like episode comedian car getting coffee haha
change flat tyre
self driving car handle snowstorm centimeter muddy snowslosh passing rerouted road next roadwork site getting blared rear ambulance armed carjacking protestors crossing road ill give second thought meanwhile ill think earth theyll solve self driving motorcycle
min infomercial defectionem avaritiam
bus taxi fully autonomous drive much notice tired begin driving aggressive couple year happened uber driver switched uber driver friendlier drove carefully taxi driver
would buy tricycle toddler didnt pedal could take whereever entirely malfunction kill million billion proven accidentfree mile meaningless emotion however reliable proven always simply give control look science vaccine number ffs simply going ton people always give much control machine scientific consensus overwhelming statistical probability mean people buy lottery ticket despite odds emotion always drive decision reality
country taxi driver order ubers ambush driver break car wonder lifespan driverless car
lol reason drive car enjoy manual gear shift
wow waste gas ever actually go anywhere drive around enjoy shifting
cool convince brainlet politician fund proper public transportation system
isla keily lol good one
regarding finishing remark reducing traffic time spent traffic accessibility creating le car dependent environment instead filling self driving vehicle true solution traffic problem problem caused car traffic various form lie completely different view mobility future urban environment exist even much enjoyable without current level car dependency thus huge number car whether driverless driver operated
fail mention several big issue video autonomous car construction zone fault one car end killing someone still statistically likely happen point car rented like every subscription service semi thing like also self driving like airplane someone monitor basically im saying havent convinced yet think stood driving car great people really bad driving dont especially like driving enjoy driving making decision call old school fuddyduddy thats
need technology alert people leave kid pet car
car escape tell might person back seat turn car someone back still pay attention noise make least little bit failsafe
modisk sadly happens every summer dont understand
look forward theyll decrease number accident involving car revisionist history podcast pointed medium one host attempting throw front waymo motion virtually eliminate accident involving pedestrian cyclist cyclist would tell cycling mph road near residential neighborhood point time car road point history absolutely freaking terrifying
yeah safe ultimately technology want u divert eye world screeneven driving
fascinating train
scalable infrastructure actually work cant profit
hiimzack suppose big rail isnt sponsor video
transition period going tough obviously wont ready leap every road type cant imagine tackling dirt road local village rubbish drive road part dont want wreck car well end situation lot autonomy occasional infrequent forced human driving human practice driving well worse world without perfect road transition period going weird sloppy deadly probably ultimately necessary inevitable buckle fun
replace human experience intuition see bunch kid playing football distance likely one gon na run front see strange slick corner know thats dangerous see bunch folk gun distance get idea also gps doesnt work well amongst skyscraper
instead arizona come italian city see one car wont even move parking spot reason never sense safe move
martin
martin elevator plane safe
martin neither point point oc dont feel safe italian traffic say
martin agree trying say want see one car behaves proper chaotic traffic narrow european road technology amazing pas proper test
title dont like told
thing im worried inevitable decade become painfully clear human holding back potential traffic manually driven car phased would need stoplight future car talk eachother mesh network
forgot mention dont like much really like going drive fun
happen driver one talking
handle rain dust storm
chain fountain mould effect
well technology work adverse weather like rain fog snow
airplane land without seeing id assume driverless car
afaik snow fog rain posse problem lidar
horribly big problem rain snow thats test done california weather mostly sunny also car front stop car stop wait wait wait wont even try going around car front traffic signalization doesnt allow human would still computer follows traffic rule last binary digit
geofenced phoenix arizona risk high right weird weather guess well data point survived year hail flash flood risk pending
cinegraphics work fine rain snow including predicting proper braking distance precaution based current weather dont know got information reason contact human control center tell stopped vehicle direct car move alternatively control center would know problem active ride would stopped unusual amount time would alerted
weather car handle rain fog camera lidar detector get fogged
rhing happens window get fogged stop
die driverless car trust driverless vehicle also believe im better driver
red light automatically slow car pretty basic thing technological advancement
human yellow light serf warning light turn red slow human strangely speed
feel like car indicator noise
privacy
rfil aware fact concern privacy selfdriving car use camera among one tool navigate road see everything everyone field view meaning happened walk past car manufacturer know well car manufacturer going handle data happen used part protest thats want know
dont get human get stupid drive many idiot road maybe time sharpen way test people even iq test year old able drive crazy expect people young much going level head safety awareness experience moment get driver license start driving time creating driving style ignore half learned whatever let alone knowlege car keeping maintained saying automated driving bad would mean take away normal car people free drive around reduce traffic also achieved living closer work reason hear video safety work watch movie sit nothing take train
ad dont need self driving car need le infrastructure wasted car way bike lane future try achieve want survive climate crisis
car culture biggest obstacle
really gave something think believe analogy automatic elevator flawed first elevator operator would equate car driver passenger operator went strike definitely enjoy driving board car becoming driverless second elevator operator resemble taxi service taxi driver could potentially get board groundbased taxi becoming driverless groundbased say yes increasingly likely airbased taxi service might become reality notsodistant future
im assuming getting driverless car first time akin getting car first time driver eg youre first time got car one friend driving probably scary realized also competent driver
think better average human say person who benefit
really cool plan getting independent party test technology produce independent data im sure rely data company build technology sponsor video
yeah fact figure self driving car tech come directly company producing test condition avoid difficult real world driving situation many human deal every day hydroplaning pedestrian dark fog construction mechanical failure obstruction road faulty road marking signal many million accident free selfdriving test mile occur handful block broad daylight without venturing mph im worried mph lower accident town time people involved walk away modern car lot driving monotonous easy automate dont think anybody argues point lot difficult driving situation dont pop suburban cali area many deadly accident occur self driving car cant stop middle road real world user force upon situation
rfil human regularly collide kill deer
ai researcher far biggest concern selfdriving car road unpredictable human car selfdriving esp comms going safer long time happen
b weather inclement autonomous car fail badly ie snow ice
love veritasium im definitely glad sponsor buti get little queasy sponsor subject video feel pretty much like commercial case waymo
imagine long commute work good thing get sleep
moron would trust robot drive
unlokia maybe moron among u exactly dont want road
interesting point unlikely bed home bad car seat comfortable would rather sleep car v bed home
take bus century ahead
ivellecog among u
know even better autonomous car efficient public transport car super wasteful way transportation ut city completely massacred urban planning order accommodate car start switching research investing public transport much sustainable safe car general
think many couple would sex driverless taxi
responsible accident happen
whats point able sleep car drive dumb driverless car dont anything reduce traffic still dont trust rather something improving public transportation improving fuel emission driverless car drive u home sleepy
main problem human psychology lenient come human error unforgiving sort mistake could coming automate ego clearly showing
jessica sweety hotgirl vlogs made phd late pattern recognition time skeptical could manage build selfdriving car one example following imagine windy day plastic bag suddenly flying low front car blocking way human well know plastic bag doesnt pose kind threat might little surprised likely wouldnt react could car reaction try avoid collision bag turn cause problem road recent video selfdriving car getting stuck roadwork cone set road situation never encountered training far plastic bag example yet even simpler still quite way go nevertheless would never guessed far gone year second point time still valid psychological acceptance public thing overall selfdriving car already safer human problem make mistake human dont make hand dont make mistake human typically make due lack attention psychological bias make u intolerant nonhuman mistake robot simply fail human wouldnt failed say fail mean error margin hard one single instance one single mistake made robot human would likely fine outrage whole public hand tend turn blind eye mistake due lack attention simply negligence looking mirror selfdriving car would never fail tolerate thousand death due human error every year one death due robot avoiding thousand death meantime throwing u quite irrational huh meant said ego
mean whend pay advertise wont say anything bad lol
enforcement blanket way always thing done automotive world inhibit enthusiast ability enjoy driving funsatisfaction utility people lazy average tho people use appliance move around average really bad driver incredibly prone distraction bad decision making overreliance assistance tech make much sense move use autonomous car never go far outlaw driving driving older vehicle
well said
ive self driving car whole life didnt know thanks
want car reward good driver disallow lazy unobservant irresponsible stupid car like contribute epidemic stupidity society ultimate downfall
funny human civilization around thousand year suddenly fall due autonomous car
thats cool wan na drive manual v corvette year hope isnt mandated ya know
driverless car people drive truck living robot chomping bit finally take
fill fuel
driverless car better normal car better public transit infrastructure like train rather least us dependance inefficient car centric transport far far
bro want need watch video
self driving car like cab right order one
thing driverless car drive fine normal condition time problem dont think fully equipped condition would pose danger day saw video tesla freaking yellow moon thinking yellow light slow also video another tesla getting confused truck right infront carrying street sign irregular road doesnt clear path follow etc could go
solution million death carrelated incident th century develop automation car technology refining road etc shut road shut car manufacturing company making driving illegal many case etc car blight city life
riiiight thats ever going happen even might surprised many unintended consequence dislike even
think take consideration tire pop worst possible time like coming traffic left tire pop
would say scariest part driverless car driverless car people follow driving rule etiquette person drive motorcycle painfully aware time driving motorcycle really put thing whole perspective others course sufficiently advanced autonomous vehicle able handle sticky situation better human given computer reaction time lack mental stress heat moment still would say biggest reason people afraid tomorrow woke entire country suddenly converted fully autonomous vehicle dont think would much fear would mix people computer driving
basically ted kaczynski correct reliant technology thing happens like hack mistake oil pipeline shuts whats next
damn wish vehicle year ago great hopefully next year norm instead exception also remember elevator operatorsnotice didnt say driver still fairly common early fifty show old
could uber car demand would explode
look absolutely terrified
simple solution traffic monkey driving car cgp grey
know robust public transportation infrastructure
hiimzack shhh dont let automotive megacorps hear might screw u
let government control car crash political opinion differs
government company
rauruatreides car system security back door like phone government access every communication make car different government full access destination location time
people like point trolley problem car decide car hit ignores lot pointed yes incident actually trolley problem nature begin another thing ad would reduce instance trolley problem would even issue begin would generally reduce amount incident meta trolley problem ad yes different people may die harmed far fewer people die harmed rejecting ad allowing trolley continue track kill people providing ad switch switch send trolley track far fewer people eliminating far greater number accident would caused human error
even one mention another selfdriving car
elevator onedimension path guided cable aeroplane mostly selfpiloting still supervised guided pilot immediately take control emergency car thousand driver making minute decision everything speed direction whether respond text message order selfdriving vehicle work without concern theyd stop blowing getting bug make drive road everyone would selfdriving vehicle could communicate digitally avoid crash without risk hacked could create possibility remote murder kidnapping thats dont like autonomous car rail road car couldnt change lanesleave road completely id accepting wouldnt car train
cool technology public infrastructure needed cellular service moving city rural road often gravel foul weather implication snow mud road wondering there review strength limitation especially municipal planner thank
car sound really expensive think thats biggest problem current price car make never mainstream
many u eyesight work meter away completely irrelevant question something thats meter away isnt going affect unless plane thats crashing right path case driverless car wouldnt save either fully agree large majority people forced go driverless car would safer basically anytime youve accident cop determine cause distracted driving car need confiscated replaced driverless one driver license revoked people would better driver computer
good example last statement
thank posting cyclist skeptical self driving car able handle sharing road cyclist technology look promising make good point car much safer human driven car patient
good example selfdriving car good observing reacting good identifying predicting despite interesting thing prediction narrator mention second later inexperienced distracted human driver might slammed brake situation experienced driver paying attention would picked visual cue pedestrian went undetected car many sensor camera one minor example realworld problem much serious implication prove tough camera lidar computer predict avoid
would want driver le car mode could still drive
hacker want hijack isnt really simple considering one try hacker doubt
couldnt also hacked
nice waymo ad could make reflected video topic actually talking independent expert topic mean current problem waymo scalability need complete map city run rigorous simulation test ride even thinking deploying waymo system least current fsd approach bringing system new city would potentially take year car getting stuck often difficult situation car often stop team driver every waymo car street show unreliable moment drive car take manually obviously get better time would take potentially year really would need human backup crash statistic might biased driver know waymo car driverless may watch dont trust waymo car thus careful around adverserial attack basically hacking neural net giving weird input like weird picture although problem yet quite difficult highly theoretical point potential hacker might print weird picture banner basically completely brick carleads crash etc name critical point wished video dont get wrong astonishing tech able waymos approach currently promising however video absolutely uncritical basically reading script waymo gave really sad
driver react know car infrontbehind driverless avoiding accident communication behaving predictable way driverless car behave like human driver expect could lead accident driverless car mistake simply human would make sense sudden stop good example maybe human driving behind would assume plenty room pas even pedestrian side sudden stop although aiming avoiding risk collision pedestrian could surprise car following behind maybe exactly situation illustration
veritasium there huge amount missing upload firstly driverless car year away cant go everywhere human go ready take train travel linear track huge proposition control system external even year still driver there comparison car aircraft aircraft travel air separated traffic air lane good proportion journey controlled air traffic control land automatically airport cat landing system airport even cat airport pilot still get runway disembarking point hand aircraft cant id say completly automated train completly automated aircraft start completely automated car
sorry im going drive regular gas car till day die
q lidar navigation becomes mainstream environment especially urban environment saturated lidar beam lidar present health risk human animal vision lidar malfunctioning lidar cause issue optical electronic equipmentsensors might trading one problem problem
lidar generally us infrared laser harmful anything else give infrared radiation like engine human
autonomous vehicle potential make public transit much accessible people cant walkbike long distance small lightweight lowcost relatively low speed ondemand robotaxis essentially autonomous neighborhood electric vehicle could added public transit system solve last mile problem widespread unlikely change u existing real estate infrastructure isnt going change decade even lightweight lowspeed autonomous vehicle probably need type specialized lane guidance marker system work reliably enough also current law would changed solve inevitable legal liability public relation problem result lot unoccupied motor vehicle public road thing human driver dont expect cant predict looking driver none
least thing fully automated want still pop driver sit drive car want following law lidarcamera fails take mechanic locked think handling well x terrain may also want take control dont fell confortable emergency stop button feel better manual override switch case want use need active aproach sit drive pasive aproach think would better hey drive try ever ready prepared
never accident consider good driver would trust selfdriving car good safety system x trust others know limitation limitation others really love idea automated driving system
would liked see le commercial presentation one dedicated scientific topic example happens hundred car small area emitting million lidar beam per second
q durable camera system term material used like scratch snow lidar sensor effect ability drive correctly q frequent require serviced order keep working properly
hackingprivacy scare automation
driverless car crash test engineer ok drive wall fast driverless car umm engineer thats pas
would fun
im afraid cant dave
v need thumb
faismasterx agree
v open door car sinking afraid
anyone multiple duo conviction forced buy use sort car want continue use automobile yes would let car drive might bit uneasy first minute adapt
hacking scare automation
still feel like human driver better choice since human still better certain situation ai still make mistake
know maybe invest public transportation
kind autonomous train maybe soon autonomous bus maybe future like auto ubers picking people city rural area transit would either innaccesible way expensive
umm ok found way get around daily commute bother europe called public transport driving fun thing
parsimonious rowboat reciprocally match chance immediately ban following noiseless cellar abandoned dynamic kilogram
like content feel sorry make one probably forced obscenely ignore telsa accumulated billion mile worth date probably point compared million mile waymo doesnt even hold candle tesla thank tho content need come promote idea fsd
amount downvotes video scary
like driverless car still seatbelt fastened
car sold send warning seatbelt fastened
nocivolive get think funny
disappear vehicle road autonomous thing autonomous car control human directed vehicle
yes still unreliable human road could parked parking lot still need seat belt case
also know seatbelt law
cool level exists chandler mesa
bad road city distributed physically dont think see self driving car soon yo dont kind reference line signal pretty bad shape
tell tf pedestrian supposed cross
whenever heavy rain wind highway germany rather use cruise control lane assistance drive
one shouldnt use cruise control road slippery
felixantoinetremblay
still year year away full level autonomy even possible ever achieve despite auto industry saying really easy create automated system deal every single weird thing come across road even get itll take outlawing nonautonomous vehicle ever trust life software designed gm ford etcs lowest bidder
something wasnt touched safety software im curious become popular hacked hijacked people malicious intent
lot comment like short answer theyre safe hacking long answer unlikely car software allow full control anything onboard system even le likely anything override emergency stop function hacker could reprogram car able would stop car working demand ransom company car rather trapping people also always kick window
lol overcrowded asian country smiling naivety currently road car driving defect barely traffic dont even exist dream fine move electric car first petroldiesel one
think going driverless car immediately going fly everyday transportation driver behind wheel mostly autonomous car popular get company think fantastic keep going growing everyday carsinstall option autonomy get people acquainted first problem isnt ridiculous ethical scenario car see meter ahead identify situation immediately slow question hit completely table problem getting bulk driver used behind wheel option turn control new car sens raining turn wiper freaked first im loving little step giant step
dont drive perfectly drive better uswhich pretty freaking easy
exact video coulda made like year ago right talking advanced stage self driving current hurdle holding back tech
next question use data gaming community take experience billion hour back real world
im sure coming soon issue selfdriving car im fully certain waymos method best one right work phoenix never rain snow city flat board car limited geofenced area sure sustainable update entire fleet anytime construction happens anywhere tesla aiming drive anywhere road might take lot longer finally finish think itll useful might even roll certain place quickly im sure fast waymo plan map every single town city world even north america
wan na see handle average bmw driver stuck cm behind rear kmh
scenario vehicle might mumble freaking idiot besides camera could send video nearest cop take care problem think everywhere turn literally camera recorded police could hundred thing recording every move make want drive anymore
make sense accident caused human error since almost car driven human maybe thats misleading statistic car driven software accident would caused software even ground traffic controller human theyre capable error well
entirely human error car tyre blow catch fire otherwise fail mechanically cause fatality
wonder tracking laser work car meet would interfere like different frequency could recognize
computer handle crosswind
lidar doesnt work rain snow icy condition
put cone around driverless car waiting red light see autonomous
would sit cone around vehicle would mean vehicle supposed would fine
think goal make people trust autonomous car video sponsored someone making gon na kinda limited applicability
unless lot already think car future self driving car way go try get public transport improved u place currently carcentric
video reminds delamain cyberpunk
ethical dilema mostly capitalism make car try avoid killing pedestrian mean running road maybe hurting owner car make car hit threat owner car market car gather statistic driver killed injured per distance travelled people pick safest user order better serve client free market capitalism push manufacturer towards hitting pedestrian need set rule manufacturer order avoid issue sale might benefit killing user current car pedestrian killing machine proved rule stict enough
tech shared adopted current car manufacturer
absolutely car wont take want go car take area take walmart car take freedom protest take target car radio station worship emperor xi worship emperor xi car unlock door want get take education center tortured till submit government
think downside people get motion sickness controlling car
thinking driver believing average surely say something ability eg know people totaled car year driver licence one accident year anyway also say something understanding average mean
bit human overrating driver prowess reminds story mom told got driver license getting learner permit basically never used let parent drive whole time practically never getting driving experience day permit set expire dad took crunch driving practice could get driver license come day actual test practical portion completed uh proctor thats right term came asked taught drive saying one best driver hed seen day practice admittedly likely refers people getting learner permit people starting get road thats bar certainly well million mile experience
wanting driverless car road assumes programmer good avoiding mistake software bug happen software code write higher possibility bug bug lead death lot ask programmer say think right accident happens whose fault programmer car hold accountable
question isnt bug blame le people die car autonomous autonomous car lead decrease accident worth even accident still happen even mean there one blame
drive indian road talk
miss physic video
cool tech wonder handle multilane road roadworks left confusing road marking old paint hasnt removed also traffic increase autonomous car make walking around city even harder already
thanks episode derek one question nobody seems ask though happens road saturated many vehicle using lidar proximity sensing technology surely interfere
seems like way take advantage imagine bruce almighty scene car making path would see situation whole city automated even emergency vehicle talk siren maybe pedestrian car
perform common weather driving condition like snow rain heavy rain figure deeper standing water predict attempt pull car right tell predict black ice adjust figure much reduce speed manage driving extreme heavy cross wind condition interstate
good point wonder sensorssoftware able reliably ignore tumbleweed blowing across road swervestop something substantial
see usage full autonomous vehicle rising future last statement getting back lost time reclaiming parking lot green space take lot adoption l car talking full vehicle sharingno ownership type system least america long way
one day free man get car door lock car go airport diplomatic gate right back plain china iran russia venezuela cuba watch executed tv numb already happen expense dictator public first must get rid environment hazard dictator stand free people shot death today blinded letting u make money always lie one raise ego make fall reach founder reach freedom mankind child pay highr gaining
happens car make choice protecting passenger protecting someone road would choose passenger take kid run front car swerve way wall taking passenger know crash rare important come buying car car protects passenger car b favour someone road people buying would choose option know selfish reality
im pretty sure feel take bus subway anyone ever think driver people see thing reading sleeping playing phone whatnot dont really get issue like situation applies many circumstance dont tell whatever something one care point suddenly big thing
whats weird driverless car wouldnt want one would rather human driver
risk ai system getting hacked thats currently main concern regarding technology
gon na ask question sure hacking may unlikely potential consequence concern
ambulance oncoming lane react
please put train bus road instead kind car
yeah want go store suburb would like bound bus schedule take hour cost go get gallon milk right take minute cost cent worth electricity sign
saying many accident due human error machine wouldnt make enough scientific point view im sorry also say many accident avoided human machine wouldnt able avoid much difficult estimate ensure zero addition going driverless car people able drive like removing chocolate supermarket people able eat properly teach people properly make probabliity human error decrease drastically moment people realize car weapon allowed driven proven fully capable careless driving punished voluntary homicide see need fully automated vehicle
please nice train ffs
driving car human like shooting gun shooting range
instead working public transportation help environment driverless car
public transportation system doomed failure usa place built yes take public transportation work cost round trip take hour way around pretty shady people neighborhood driving electric vehicle take minute cost round trip pick waze carpooler make increase time minute way occasion take rider way make increase time minute cost way autonomous car pick rider quick succession drop way person pay way almost fast driving cant wait becomes reality dump month worth car sit around time nothing depreciating value literally cost day vehicle person house think unusual way either want go somewhere tell alexa within couple minute ride arrives bet spend le half never worry car repair space garage
also fewer number car street total
traffic ballet driving near end like philippine rarely accident road rage rare light beep beep horn people drive sensibly there traffic yelling
yes see future one drive public road transport automated city encourage public transportation public transportation ground road may mean bus also taxi like car get subscription certain area whole city get use car maybe similar first one simple interior think complete automation would mean le expense people regarding transportation need buy maintain car maybe even get compelled use bike walk short distance also would mean issue parking issue noise pollution within city would electric course issue getting stuck traffic road rage everything would work like well oiled system driving enthusiast still circuit drive like gun range whatever fun controlled environment anywhere want
cant wait future
remember telsa car set fire drove around thought great
funny thing tesla car catch fire every single one make news every single one per caput basis gas car catch fire time rate think hot engine exhaust huge amount highly flammable liquid fire
wonder government deal driverless car regarding driverslicense would need driverslicense buy automatic car would make sense would since something go wrong human would able take even incredibly low chance happening make sense make wonder money effort spent getting license waste
car killed passenger year back
oh going happen india people drive like playing gta
like driving car never stop
insurance company youll get point risk human driving way autonomous driver theyll refuse insure manufacturer stop making car steering wheel etc extra cost
found potential safety issue could exploited car go side road stop sound siren good thing could exploited bad actor force car stop robkidnapetc driver
car would tough time calculating possibility indian road might stand still good accident dont move till someone hit blue
laughed way hard im going hell
get opportunity buy car steering wheel id first im terrified ill get accident happens
feeling learner driver nerve anxiousness simply turning road think
viewing veritasiums autonomous vehicle question waymo think driverless car really possible near future workable automatic parking system parking lot super market system simple enough driver drive car super market loading bay get car car driven find empty parking space wait owner call car back car driven loading bay pick owner straight forward le variable huge demand car driver solve jamming near shopping center technology guy avoid comparatively easier practical job park car fix parking lot instead tackle difficult one high way way round technology guy promoting easier job ie running high way still long way succeed order get funding driverless car actually long way succeed since even make system park car iteslf even parking lot could added fix sensor way cheat help car parked
karen see accident say unsafe murder box ignoring safe trip
well big problem accident who blame passenger company servicing vehicle company produce car really big issue one accident question need answered mean youre car crash least chalk blame one thing crash get really murky mean people agency ai
anameofsomesort car ton camera though play video recording back like black box audio recording plane
here idea create govmt run liability fund autonomous vehicle eliminate need private insurance make mandatory tech put every vehicle sold within year almost criminal isnt already place air bag seat belt crash testing etc didnt happen manufacturer wanted
here idea remove car get better infrastructure make walkable road make public transit train subway
due cheap insane much quality life disabled increaseand even immigrant foreigner cant speak languagejust need make copy language rather staff need learn
problem want see would react idiot swerving speeding riding bumper cutting freeway imagine car programmed obey speed limit barely anyone else live also narrow road especially dense residential area pulling near parked car even stopping waiting oncoming traffic pas required mention poorly maintained road line longer visible driverless car perform well area probably chosen engineer design team condition perform well wont tell u much
thank
arrogance guy one video want people trust car educated people new dictator want tell think feel everything time force
video enjoyable real eye opener would great see bit criticism highlighting limitation didnt need quite puff piece im sure company wouldnt minded talking would happen dropped car london england stand dont really know vehicle work city set work city grid layout indeed handle ancient city quirky tight layout blind corner etc
still concern hacker snow light snow road like face quebec sometimes foot high pile snow middle road often time inch across road car deem unsafe continue stop bos expecting come work normal around amount snow road ice sometimes unconvenient place high hill curve fact life northern part world take lot risk winter society expect continue working even road icy food still need delivered grocery store small village accessible one road happens several high hill sometimes way youre able climb iced hill climbing reverse yes southerner thats something unusual several hilly rural area canada big fauna moose really tricky stop hit wait see cross road go back wood also keep evaluating moose mood looking like going charge vehicule case youre better move
american road super wide straight wonder itd handle tight winding old victorian street england
imagine car deciding best way navigate rush hour instead thousand stressed people belive journey important one would soo good
would like hear detail statistical comparison manual driving condition place versus driverless driving obviously current statistic driverless going smaller sample size honestly expert judging validity statistical comparison though know enough skeptical fast loose statistic recall video making claim driverless statistically safer claim seemed bit quick flavored shall say excitement bias occasionally felt envisioned ideal driverless car compared actual manual driving video rather actual driverless hour v accident compared withdriver hour v accident
question got watching video lidar interfere like would still work hundred car use next
understand automated driving must conservative instance car stopped abruptly someone shopping cart passed another car driven human following time would bumped abrupt stop would driverless car would chose stop le abruptly
humandriven car would bump also fully fault accident actually problem early test since autonomous car would actually stop every single stop sign driver expect
okay closest concern task harder machine better human task period physical computational task human edge arent asking important question like control technology one terrified answer
cant wait make ipo
plot twist car isnt driverless driver th dimension hence he invisible
unless steering wheel also dimensional still would see fingertip wheel maybe even finger hand
well thats fine usa europe mil wont cut plenty associated problem around road consider getting though get jam vehicle youre toast literally move cause accident two option
yeah make sense europe dont infrastructure american concerning car guess would work bigger city big e road like ee autobaun
biased vedio showing good side thought unbiased one
concern isnt necessarily safety selfdriving vehicle massive amount trucker could putting work
everytime go driving im cut uptailgatedfollowing someone who place one time going road someone went overtake coming way wasnt got mad many people die road make better
year road accident yes im average driver
would car refill gas tho
human operated car still allowed
came say driverless car killed woman jay walking
cant wait car hacked
would like see car heavy rainsnow icy condition dont forget sand wet dirt untill self driving car manage hard weather condition thn technology still year away
good luck driving india
karen see vehicle thrash want control dont want buy god nothing control
youre funny youll never funny explore career option
pbjandahighfive bout u
derek id love see content covering technology detail especially practicality reliability maintenance requirement lidar sensor something work great arizona would fail first time hit mosquito
human machine learn differently comparing time unit correct
could make another video waymo cruise talk absurd ammount downside system pre map every road everything around possibly leave pre map area scalable whole world even big city every time construction road layout change map area
waymo joke eaten tesla solution scalable
comparing accident statistic bad thing since dont know many wouldve cause system world using driverless car
waymo sponsorship nullifies video credibility dont mix advertisement content
autonomous driving perfect road condition count cant put waymo anywhere near actual busy city like new york
road built human driver
would selfdriving car zooming everywhere sound terrible world dont wan na see making road self driving car drive efficiency terrible idea opinion making already car centric world worse reduce traffic reducing car selfdriving selfdriving bus public transport im
heavy snowfall rainfall texas mudstorm
genius said car road selfdriving one getting destination
totally wont negative consequence exchanging direct control ability travel safety
autonomous car least year away probably longer may work great desert think much worse snow ice give stop snow completely obscures lane addition handle construction weird line everywhere carelessly placed sign multitude problem airplane really good analogy many externally placed sensor ground help guide plane human keep plane way
vehicle way mo experience see ill week
could mentioned boeing autopilot malfunction cause entire plane crash force company ground aircraft worldwide
watch people tire see theyre turning merge
excited fully autonomous car see serious problem scenario depicted end video people stop using public transit favour autonomous car comfortable create ridiculous scenario road filled single passenger even passenger car trying avoir parking fee doesnt feel like backward step term sustainable mobility
available autonomous vehicle move b people balance convenience price example trip city centre autonomous bus tram trip town bowling alley supermarket may require autonomous car cheaper driver pay bus move faster co human driver interface autonomous car would probably parked giant town car park battery operated
ok test drive india
see think thing nifty youre completely missing truth technology whats dangerous make thing safer many people killed distracted driver cell phone many people killed people backing horsedrawn carriage many people committed suicide locking carriage house horse running technology nifty never necessary negative impact planet health human animal difficult see call progress unless final goal make earth uninhabitable goal
waymo available small mapped area self driving probably coming nowhere near right real solution good public transport network
thats exactly video said watch
want given priority traffic could make premium subscription point itll take place dont want go company sponsoring
mile doesnt know guy move lol
driverless car officer specifically instructed passenger put seatbelt swear
elevator take min arrive still stop every floor although full true dont kill people
yeah problem public transportation also
hard pas autonomous vehicle brain liberal
moral dilemma thing drive mad human choose two motorcyclist hit suddenly become trivial problem third option hitting either odds situation actually ever happening worse ai make wrong choice human made choice chance autonomous vehicle road kind choice wouldnt need made anyway dont need choose two accident accident first place
airplane dont deal crazy people airplane dumb thing problem full automation new condition program deal every day always new interesting crazy stunt people actual traffic true self driving car better driver human human still lot better detecting intent pattern behaviour human essential traffic
listed advantage driverless car basically described advantage public transport
exactly tf need driverless car take taxi bus tube public transport
car sharing respectivly already use non autonomous car though autonomous car would still need le parking lot
peace thing half arent really available u pretty well public transport foot bike live country like u outside major city public transport isnt available paying person drive around pretty expensive
thought problem still public transport limitation even increase example time number bus avaliable still person want go place person b catch bus place want go place creates problem extrapolate city ou country entire population would require limitless bus circuit bus stop everywhere would impractical
yeah driverless car dont come disadvantage public transport kinda important
sir asteroid nearing earth week august rd please give information thanking
hacker everybody dy
odd there still elevator driver one biggest mall province mine make think much really caught modern world place also technologically advanced place enough keep going ig
probably dont trust public behave accordingly old school people would jam elevator stand exit elevator elevator going back inside elevator go floor came repeat elevator later security guard
slammed brake guy cart overly dramatic damaging brake regular driver wouldve slowed turned give cart room sound inside even tell turning even going consider brake hard airplane really worry landing mile space next plane car road condition foot next car bicycle pedestrian traffic merging construction worry whats going way stop negotiate human driver pedestrian
think watching video worse car world replaced autonomous car camera microphone life surveillance
prevalence cellphone already
read comment surveillance think illegal activity driving afraid seen vehicle dont get grip stop fear mongering
utarch meant he monitored autonomous vehicle he right even youre law abiding citizen dont want continuous surveillance anybody whether governmental commercial
hate one tell already surveillance
really matter
autonomous car car road safer well good party hurdle overcome law set place company make driverless car confident enough product assume responsibility possible death people good theyre autonomous car safe claim
im glad az people cant drive every single day always least one crash freeway
must live small town major city there probably least per day
thought saw hurricane thumbnail
back person killed one car big stink however bet look million mile car driven human driver would killed dozen hundred people equivalent distance
central mainframe control vehicle city sound much safer
mean thing elon planning fro tesla drive car using g network happens network signal lost central computer experience bug massive crash
cinegraphics yes car would brake
alphadream car must perfectly able drive without internet connection external data used help improve traffic find better route etc car able drive least like human without external help make car brake time mean youre relying everyones safety weakest link one malfunctioning car one broken antenna car wont able receive collective command resulting chain crash thats reckless programming expect introduced recent solution mostly crap made using crappy programming practice crappy tool crappy programming language talk horrible internet safety
cinegraphics okay strong network doesnt g besides every car connected well aware way malfunction handled way
alphadream nope comm chip die wont able communicate anything module sometimes block produce crash even without internet connection driving module crash real possibility software update add dependency probability accident multiplies example dependent module work time combined reliability added system decrease reliability best totally independent car must able drive safely without internet connection system completely controlled central computer banned law make le reliable ordinary car human driver
concern safety around hackability another terrorist event waiting happen crash car around world push button kill million billion
self driving car going future carbon neutral car need even gas power computer ac really step right direction
im still wondering keep incentivizing individual transportation mass transportation self driving car cool cant help feel keep missing bigger picture
car play le important role traffic use lot space make noise city build way car need enter city city le noise car traffic much livable
thats case u electric car make little noise zero pollution energy sourced green energy autonomous casualty
barsaydn really main cause noise engine rolling noise stroads one main reason car dangerous u country much safer road
guarantee waymo support tailing vehicle case something went wrong due sponsorship risk making bad video lol

wamo ughh cmon must human driving yup hooooman
concern self driving car trained road tell driving suburb blizzard difference endless white open road someone lawn extra inch snow driving dirt road forest visual difference compact road soft forest soil lower density grass want see self driving car deal happily use day day
yeah would safeif every car autonomous robot roam street people stupid might trust car environment people around
driverless car never reach sort scale meaningful percentage country dont trust want cant drive night sort bad weather there real need research effectively subsidized vc firm company like uber vested interest eliminating cost driver plane day fly take land automatically doesnt mean ever get rid air traffic controller pilot lol
happens sudden event street construction work jaywalker police signaling stop icy road someone cutting animal crossing street dont wan na run cute hedgehog car value animal life many question
autonomy car need side view mirror saying
idk dude dont trust ai drive place love driving calm hate passenger car im control regardless who driving
dont like riding car someone else driving good driver wait poll result
lkeil confused comment saying thats said isnt dont think im average driver problem control situation saying opinion making joke
ah illusion control friend fly want control even though time likely die driving across country flying across reminded people die car accident way control illusion mind make u feel like control destiny relaxed pretty relaxed airplane flown computer pilot case flying would still safer driving without pilot cockpit
would need see track record car quebec two season winter construction work well road im sold
ive always wondered thing car handle weather driving quebec ontario horrible winter condition im sold
city focused guess find
testarossaf wonder active winter testing area
self driving car manage winter road better human soon thinking like thouse driver drive better average understand winterlidar see snow see snow thickness ice pot etc car milion mile experience winter driving dont lie
driverless car cant see snow bad weather like see hole road hacker government command car crash get around one take train wont kill people
fear fully autonomus car people useful push manufacturer car perfect creation
almost taste sponsorship tongue video
mean literally required u law state also solution traffic car self driving one
get driver wheel selfdriving car
vehicle get accident fault much extra money could needed fix tech
probably allot look new car today expensive fix due tech
please real comparison leading player field sponsored commercial disguised educational video
dont want autonomous car truck dont work highway well yet furthermore politician done nothing prepare society fore technology dozen million people lose job within year
car camera laser vision ft field vision recording world time could possibly go wrong people havent read dystopian surveillance ai based sci fi novel
try telling car go dont want go
people afraid watched seen time something hide
even say anything want le stupid people charge people life better literally live world revving car joke kill entire family yet people tiktok
revving car joke kill entire family
tesla
bro fix damn seatbelt
love idea doesnt look like set speed function remember minority report scene cop turn car dont want
aaroex gaming remember movie basically government entity full control car
aaroex gaming yeah one scene safety people whole nothing hide nothing fear trope even nothing hide want full control car really good movie watch feel like slowly headed towards reality something like
predict wont happen future mundanely back future reference movie tho higher quality life safety expect speed limiter auto soon
veritasium clearly little knowledge way airliner function way operated airplane use automation autonomy totally different thing airliner doesnt fly mile without human input control first fully automatic landing performed nothing new certainly one cant argue would worked without human loop furthermore auto landing even cat il approach foot minimum crosswind moderate turbulence high wind gust doesnt work autopilot especially autothrottle time soon figure auto throttle autopilot cant keep condition hand fly condition foggy cat il auto landing actually easy automated system requires primitive equipment autonomy long way see widespread use long time come even top military winding expectation autonomy come semi autonomous system full autonomy doesnt work many case picking two extreme base entire opinion airplane flown really joke maybe look accident happened automation automation autonomy place certain aspect holy grail trying promote

would love vehicle like always shitscared driving partially minor form adhd periodically make black eventually stopped driving completly sold car good driver anyway rammed car twice somewhat short driving time asked think im average driver id definetly say happily embrace new ai car overlord
here fall need least year category dont live u thinking globally taking consideration say chaos variable every country huge task cant accomplished autonomous vehicle alone need reform traffic law increase security perfect road lot area
fun game russian hacker hack car
dumbest thing planet driving one greatest thing earth
imagine getting eye damage looking lidar
think one negative thing driverless car might reason u invest better public transportation consequence lead worse outcome term co reduction traffic think car handle specific problem cant handled mass transit eg people living somewhere really remote people disablitlites etc really hope become driverless quickly possible
well tbh percent would driver awful proclaimed could theoretically average xd
world near perfect driver would still average
lkeil thats correct funny thing distribution uniquiely weighted thats actually possible better average
future driverless car free human error make reliable safe reliability perfection keep increasing
keep making driverless car better turn subway
comfortable fun thing develop necessary order fight climate change need urgently
great video ill bet auto manufacture worried autonomous car autonomous vehicle huge impact auto oil industry one question though driverless vehicle adjust ac liking tune radio favorite station
actually weird think like inside robot car
assistance fine ai control time bad
honestly would still terrified every kilometer way
thats drive mile
tothegames badum tss
tothegames welp cant argue
please lower music volume speaks trouble deciphering said even without annoying music music annoying music enjoy veritasium please abolish music annoying thanks g
yes autopilot good low visibility come wind especially crosswind almost every landing made man autopilot disengage automatically autopilot perfect routine job special case like low vi approach outside comfort zone pilot outstand least moment
yes please pay car insurance another oil change ready
giant bloody sign top vehicle detail sue charge culpability accident happens
funny thing fault without doubt human driver oh human argue driverless car driving slow like idiot something stupid cause accident fact almost case accident one prevelant scenario
gon na bother watching already tell title youre trying make people confuse driverless car selfdriving technology
human abscent minded distracted along worse variable emotional make commit mistake welcome driverless car time issue see driverless car fixed
solution better driver training higher requirement passing test get license think see driver obviously doesnt follow rule road wonder got license many yelled one
cope road work block new uncharted road
okay fancy expensive car safe technology suggests far people price range doubt waymo let people borrow free actually expect get car mass public use
became legally blind early sorely miss freedom able drive provided cant wait technology like become widespread
dumbest title ive seen v yet
cant wait get driverless car
driverless car wont feel pressure wasted time late making le likely drive ability thats bad thing occur
good point
one becomes endowed sentience inevitably dominated intoxicating road rage go full decepticon cut immediately brake checked kyle awarded driver license bowel special edition box cuntchocula breakfast cereal earlier day
yeah also remorse rear ending someone full speed running cyclist pedestrian thanks faulty technology take one mistake
one rule ever something ability ive always got fall back emergency saved arse time car
rdc whether driver feel remorse doesnt change outcome human driver running pedestrian cyclist driver tired drunk simply paying attention
sponsered waymo ill wait year try first time someone either car outside car get hurt killed billion spent dream float away notice driverless car strict speed limit
logic people year die car crash human control ok even one person hurt killed driverless car abandon technology
many lidar car road laser pulse another car falsely register give false data manifest unknown many different mfr road musk right long term passive visual active like radar lidar
sound really interesting use public transport imo one two future self driving car meaning pay maintenance regular upgrade garage chargervisiting fuel station regularly car transport service basically taxi monthly fee mileage fee car stored depot around country always get one full chargetank trip take long asked swap car depot along way scenario cant think advantage public transport europe use car le time year need transport big object somewhere amtaking bussubwaytram way cheaper dont deal park public transport vehicle rarely break regulary maintained started share car sibling friend found hard justify paying insurance something sits garage year whole autonomous vehicle thing feel like american solution american issue
autonomous car drive street laser interfere according video use laser measure distance see object laser another autonomous car hit sensor first car
addition safety benefit would also allow ride sharing become prominent efficient people could even loan car theyre use reducing number car overall road furthermore could efficient emergency service paramedic instead one drive tends patient could working patient together would also better cargo transport delivery could operate hour human wouldnt obvious negative impact people employed professional driver already perfect analogy liftelevator driver germany given answer coal power phase world change people need adapt instead leaving cold help facilitate transition line work
work great daytime clear weather let see night rain sleet snow sand storm etc addition many area like live road narrow highway lane line border line discussion situation convinced video like
full discolsure video sponsored waymo amazes many people dont realize ad
suburb phoenix downtown atlanta want see work place road suck
might stupid question would car function amongst self driving car lidar system car lidar sensor differentiate laser light emitted car
dont know specifically one option imagine car dont emit continuous lidar signal emit light series rapid pulse pattern unique car light without signature ignored
phone signal stop working around people
phone signal multiplexed way could difficult effectively replicate lidar radar system unknown number driverless vehicle interference range
stxnw early day ive experienced interference think interference could dangerous self driving car
lemunas believe interference range lidar extremely tight doesnt send bandwidth data accept range frequencieswavelengths
great video take time free though
driver middle class kill rich imo
definitely would chosen waymo first drive waymo going go business ever successful got driving mile experience evenm ready tesla year ridiculous assumption driverless car people rocker realize good driverless ready waymo leader one greatest thing people
plane still going full autonomous one main reason guess expect good pilot able make educated guess tough choice vehicule respond human ignore faulty frozen pitot probe give kind power responsibility computer maybe ai trained well enough could remains open question agree manufacturer aim fully autonomous vehicle go car well plane driverpilot nothing time cant expect react well something go wrong inactivity dulls mind sensesyou get enough feedback progress france sncf trying make driverless train slow quiet pilot want get replaced machine impossible get mass driverless car u get driverless train france
driving fun
reminds yo momma joke
john cena driver cant see
wonder selfdriving car become lot common people stop learning layout area especially suburb like ive book store lot couldnt tell get
answer kind youre driver take work actively learn place go however still mildly learn depending attention road source never drove car boi yet
vehicle run fuel battery
didnt realise sam wendover sounded like think thats mysterious selfdriving car honest
want driverless car road ive sponsored say
quick question would lightdar behave multiple source laser beam multiple driverless car also chance know car communicate whithin certain distance
light travel straight line lidar sending light direction would need come back direction plus could use different frequency phone doesnt get interference phone
yet another reason need seriously consider ubi ai going put million people work trucker cab driver delivery driver etc support staff thats transportation trucking job replaced coding job ai lot work need ubi people basic need met without compete robot ai
aaroex gaming sociopathic edgelord doesnt make cool isnt chan buddy
waymo great need pay youtubers make video
elevator autopilot dont worry tracking object avoid collision
airplane autopilot time sure flight path planned traffic pilot communicate plane autopilot system still technology avoid collision saved countless crash
video doesnt consider downside built actually able access might denied access actually reach scale due problem like decreasing ridership public transportation carbon footprint v potential investment im roboticist technoutopian example claiming disabled people access isnt appropriate disabled people limitation wide variety disability wont accessible everyone perhaps even fewer existing mode transportation maybe check lawyer gregory mansfield learn topic
live already separate transit system pickup dropoff disabled elderly driver help loading unloading people chair item computer cant
legally allowed drive car see basically heaven
application driverless car cant otherwise would also strongly favor easily stripping driver license people demonstrate history bad driving make use driverless car think would make road safer making driver use driverless car
way would ever thisabsolute crazyand dangerous precedent mean let hand critical thinking machineslets eliminate human element arent trustworthy dangerous precedent know china hack everything history electonic sabotageyou want submit aspect autonomy machine thats risk rd party hackingenmasse yes human mostly responsible accident socially acceptable solution car urban areashave excellent public transport better everybody better training testing driverslike firearm mean u obviouslyidiots limit number vehicle licensableits privilege right etc get egocentric attitude entitlementthere many vehicle poorly designed roadwaysyou dont need separate personal car city thats accident occur
one thing didnt address hacking
dumb decade away safe
leftist impulse create perfect automated utopia evil human instinct killed people th century died automobile accident
cope thing go wrong live weather condition constantly causing driverassist feature stop functioning wintertime due ice buildup backup camera get dirty little driving dirt road rain oh personally dont trust google make anything rely use regular basis theyre bunch creep exception youtube there real alternative
completely trust driverless car fear related chineserussian hacker like watch dog tv series uploaded
love cgp grey reference legend
guy vocally driverless car laughing stock futuretheyll meme imagine great grandkids bullied school posted stupid driverless car dilemma
train v driverless car
try canada wont work work optimal condition still functional lol
selfdriving car hit someone who fault manufacturer
going depend tier level car level level manufacturer
ehh dont know think could work beautifully metro area try throwing country road snow ice there way computer adjust nuance han solo get adventure
talking autonomous car without using world tesla fsd thats easy congrats know sponsored video
tesla isnt level
mean feature tesla owner wait since day
thewebmasterify two week
thewebmasterify anyway joke apart theyre competitor different approach google ready level whole country dont think experimental beta phase tbh model camera dont think elon talking fsd
ballantineelectric personally dont high hope fsd work current hardware camera competitor use lidar combination mean technically tesla amount data collected able crazy simulation like waymo yet fsd autopilot beta scary sometimes straight dangerous
upside safer far fewer accident overall fuel efficient car could use others slipstream calculate going way elimination joyridingpolice instantly able stop criminal driver strike longer possible dont driver license getting taxi uber doesnt depend labor force anymore downside fun driving gone insurance manual drive car go roof eliminating roadsmight even actively banned government point governmentcorporations potentially control transport mean go wrong governmentcorporations dont remain mostly benevolent could hacked theoretically people drive living job potentially solved compensationubi thats long term potential
clear extent investigative video v advert getting sponsored make video company product doesnt seem like good direction go want known good source information
casually say thing like car see around like simply pointing camera surrounding area whole thing make autonomy unreachable interpretative software computer nature dont thats video tesla crashing obvious hazard
computer course capable variable known company like waymo limit fleet particular area given cercumstances like weather ordinary situation mentioned comment think human might perform better driving street easier could communicate make driving even safe
ive wishing since came school project could even drive
bit scared
never sorry
hate technology going big business small guy getting screwed million job disappear government need pay people living wage tax company accordingly pay
everyone suited career stem
id like see handle anything bright sunny weather im sure there reason operate warm desert city
exactly like airplane could land bad weather would car able
theswordcluts sure youre joking missed part said airplane mostly land bad weather silly question though computer loaded kind sensor going way better bad weather real question computer handle stupid thing human put harm way
really saying u heard part airplane landing reason autonomous car would get accident share road unpredictable idiotic human fully autonomous car world would extremely safe since could communicate one another avoid crashing
reiwalexy pile emitter around airport enable guidance system self driving car demo area sensor place roadway well documented roadway long way thing operating uncharted bad weather
danieljensen airplane rely moving air car rely traction ground huge difference also airport close time winter due snow ice runway
would also stopped point moment looked person cart wanted cross street least load could prevent cart rolling onto street cyclist put danger simply ignored priority car driving car would noticed cyclist would hurt much
car stopped thought guy might enter crosswalk guy facing vehicle would suddenly walk front moving vehicle car approaching green light would suddenly brake flowing traffic see person stepping corner getting ready ro cross light change
see people get information tech optimist hype monger would view safe technology anyone actually understands isnt currently trying sell different view machine learning engineer well aware tge current state computer vision deep neural network wouldnt go near one thing driving unsupervised tech long way ready
definitely full self driving car much safer self driving car
entire reason say technology still year away real life driving good condition every driverless car test still performed essentially controlled lab condition even one happening field
variable driving plus hackability thank far variable elevator
woman priority work sleep
also cant wait vehicle road ideally get rid car kind subscription need car ask one come get charged long use maintenance parking huge progress course safety far greater problem car might cause accident extreme case cause far le accident common case currently people actually get killed
logistic leader diy store im pretty sure biggest throwback trash found vehicle whenever make something public many ppl using show irresponsible behavior doubt machine better work human human prone work flaw teach much want never reliable machine isnt ment disrespect coworkers might say machine also fail downtime jeah thats happening dont operate maintain like supposed
affordable expensive long term maintenance part nobody want inkjet situation printer cheap get ink would insurance keep rate would budge would expect
make city even shittier like bigtech dreaming
legally blind blind legal illegal lol
im curious much got paid
doubt anything provided car invited
upstreamnl even still free ride thats form payment
unfortunate terrified elevator lol would trust driverless car though
impressive
buy one
love video usually dont watch thing like got interested lol
survey show people believe average driver well thats entirely possible average median people score score average average probably assuming gaussian distribution really case
welcome video go viral
derek please make video view computer programming technical advancement computing field
actually big problem automated system work pilot dont get regular experience leaving throttle zero seems like one thing u one worst know infrastructure design look example video netherlands street designed etc
wymos lidar future tesla vision
snowflake cant parallel park car want go driverless
u government ability hack car cause crash look like accident leak snowden cause massive job loss huge amount lowskill middle class job involve driving cardeliveries truck driver bus driver taxi etc
would gladly get waymo car right question asked would certainly consider betterthanaverage driver know nothing compared good autonomous system fully aware flaw could cause accident know computer driver could possibly way way better waymo shown sufficiently system better could ever accident million mile least shown caused others system system skill clearly exceeds mine least one two order magnitude measured mile per accident
want fewer car road le space dedicated massive road sprawl driverless car dont help
except road function efficiently wont need much parking since wont many private car parked
robertmiller make people use continue overreliance car infrastructure like obese person starting order diet coke instead regular daily lunch big mac fry make feel like youre something good actually solving real problem perpetuating
close
yeah big corporation want driver le car care safety right
computer virus
takehome message human idiot like didnt already know last year alone
waited till car went really waymo sponsored thanks
im surprised critical thinking video yes autonomous vehicules safer average driver road shared environment car autonomous everything right probably still quite hazardous dilema occure even data say otherwise computer cant buypass physic law go question hackability power consumption cost data recovery management etc video ad vehicule real argumented discussion thats sad
dereks opinion somewhat naive yes road safer traffic jam wont reduced several study pointed average amount people car would lower many driverless car drive without anyone also amount computing power needed isnt really ecological favour technology think better invest driverless public transport rather introduce million car people
id like driverless car way drive car recklessly ai car safely get way without road raging
bwahaha funny imagining car paris bucharest
many question still follow speed limit exactly people dont vehicle change speed based flow traffic autonomous vehicle would speed limit increase docan send data vehicle around eg breaking hard vehicle know ahead time start breaking would rush hour traffic reduced due people driving properly react dumb driver assuming people see vehicle like going cut thing break check
yeah thanks normal car better
yeah let take away freedom fun yaaay word obvious progress isnt always progress year people hooked computer living digital world kept alive forever everything done automaticly robot ai well lose humanity like lost half seems already
people say average driver really calculating like math exporession meaning better bad true fact people better bad better bit better bad people good driver time
people average number leg
ugjhgjf wow u r right tjhe average slightly le wow good point
im halfway video probably question answered video question vehicle nearby area close see driverless car nearby would driverless car lidar system jazz got interfered one youre
im smart guy sort situation one first pop mind test system situation every car driverless supposedly system developed people smarter
good video informative cant wait driverless revolution however positive bias result sponsored waymo counterargument make video lack credibility whole
agree
friendly bane many complex situation may know handle especially understand people outside car example someone directing traffic construction well understand pedestrian cross street rather continuing massive problem phoenix suburb pedestrian bow car could cause significant issue city tough situation happen every corner
friendly bane hmm cant wait see driverless car tackle canadian winter road dodge pothole mention repairing vehicle would obsolete im good thanks
friendly bane hand control car evil hacker government kill
friendly bane here hypothetical company owns software exploit used hackersgovernment hold everyone car hostage get want sound like happening data big corp dont think much data
get fully autonimous vehicle would much safer hope coming soon shouldnt ignore accident messy ethic get involved need think would responsible decides better hit motorcyclist helmet case ever happen okay example waymo decides
video state kind accident incredibly rare average human would plough middle road swerve randomly hit either one car response time millisecond rather second might well stop long human would still thinking reacting
every year people backing driveway parking space u people killed come fact dont eye back head come fact theyre something stupid never back space expect people vehicle moving around ever drive forward space possibly avoid back parking space ive long since lost count many time came close hit parking lot idiot backing space without able properly see behind stand like im little kid who easy miss way car parked facing inwards parking lot would ground ticket safe
waymo driven million mile meanwhile tesla driven billion mile
yet still level autonomy waymo
waymo level limited precision mapped geofenced territory basically toddler sandbox driverless car approach scalable solve general problem driverless car
emilkpetkov thank tesla shill
clickrick right say however tesla absolutely shitty well mean waymo make argument fsd although get stuck quite often however tesla ada really sad video unreflected basically ad waymo
proclaimers would walk hundred mile would walk hundred
finally drink drive legally
pilot monitoring instrument btw queue lot stuff airplane land self
personally enjoy driving would hate lose ability government say dangerous drive also wary camera car easily misused collect info people said tech behind driving software looked awesome would problem trusting software drive
youre making excellent point behind hood selfdriving namely ai youre making erroneous assumption input sensor lidar forth level today would required world selfdriving car also need level reciprocity custom signage communication method tailored car well behindthescenes functionality service like google map instance google map excellent record speed limit stretch road
let get veritasium million sub thanks quality content
car automated accident probably le likely happen since car could communicate course effective road customized built autonomous vehicle
sorry ill never ever one apart fact like drive dont want sit idle car eu regulation put liability case accident passenger selfdriving car passenger alert enough step case autonomous vehicle something unwanted babysit pay attention might well enjoy driving apart theyre stupid understand actually ok disregard traffic regulation eg traffic light stuck red doubt therell ignore red light button human see oh stuck ill drive carefully also nobody speaking absolute nightmare thing regard privacy tell everyone grandma youre going probably feature bring youre allowed
role model old elevator man
sensuku could actually adress point yknow ive said never cup tea love driving id like folk actually might want use get product thats inherently flawed reason ive pointed
ironically best laid road ie city place want remove car much possible
nice commercial forget politics murica land gas guzzling v driverless car muscle car life matter bruh
usg accept formal admission give wizard handle car stealing
doubt computer get point point b even avoid obstacle vehicle even pedestrian point main issue course human error long human driver human pedestrian even animal unpredictable still issue lived world road like digitallygated tunnel selfdriving car pedestrian analogue car would safer corridor travel commuting would also speed traffic flow imagine fleet selfdriving car driving foot apart perfect harmony issue though almost nobody talk discussion selfdriving car weather weather add huge layer problem would definitely make computer lidar radar every sensor go overdrive yesterday huge downpour came within minute gone like minute visibility outside low big fat hard rain hail imagine self driving car visibility cut almost nothing flooded street causing issue sensing lane marker even drive without hydroplaning something imagine snowy area heavy fog sandstorm yet long shot
doubt computer get point point b even avoid obstacle vehicle even pedestrian ohh boy youre gon na surprised amount technology developed
car obsolete
true
car acquired lot knowledge phoenix question would car another city road work guess big part making work training route knowledge something commuting human driver acquires waymo make initial driver assisted run street get fundamental structure much training necessary make safe enough fully autonomous edit oh description actually small part phoenix
finally year people repeating dilemma self driving car people understand doesnt matter car hit human dont work like eather
matter though responsible hit someone owner car manufacturer
thats actually already potential dilemma modern safety system non selfdriving car automatic braking system instance fail function driver fault manufacturer ultimately speaking owner car going maintain liability potential future people dont car thats future youre youre going liable accident car however youre taking responsibility insurance industry stay
thats true however moral dilemma justice issue
mcxl u cant serious safety assistance system completely different self driving car u sleep driving youre selling self driving car gon na take liability otherwise self driving car
atomic legal liability standpoint functionally identical system installed car manufacturer automatically prevent collision
engineer work something perfection would trust human error
thank boomer
happens dozen car using lidar space interference
there still idea technology invented overnight like one day self driving car previous day wed agi one day pop seemingly nowhere reality technology emerge gradient billion mile tesla top waymos commaais pave path self driving norm itll keep improving worked long human need car
play siren sound inside autonomous car system understand customer something stupid
longing vid type diabetes progress made industry interesting undergoing cure right encaptra cell delivery device new type organ made biotechnology supposed replacement work done pancreas hope see vid sister got diabetes type
emergency stop option im kinda interested know emergency go option well like instance car exceed speed limit set destination something like hospital car potentially identify threatening individual acceleratemaneuver aggressively person tried stand car path would assume normally trigger car dont run people protocol
oof video hit different whats story behind even self driving car look like coupe im aware self driving coupe
show fairly wellknown accident tesla autopilot unable distinguish bright roof surface overturned truck sky
videopipeline oh yeah wow thats problem using vision coupe though
fully autonomous last heard car using trick road system mapped extreme detail uploaded car computer without road unknown area ordinary gps sensor data go theyre hopeless still case managed push past limitation
want work hard catastrophise scenario cyclist want know ill safer start giant qr code back jersey mean im cyclist driverless car im also wary something simple standardising charging plug electric car didnt happen doesnt bode well harmonious interaction driverless car tesla know others tesla waymos know waymos etc
guy refused take elevator probably added year life exercise
people totally higher average driving skill thats whole point average median people skill level remaining skill level average would le entirely depends choice skill metric
yeah big tech good track record really want controlling go irl online cant wait til get banned car heard humming amazing grace
new technology isnt always good lol people want control dont want everything dam computer
problem new big tech get internet throw computerlaptop stair drop phone toilet
bro born wrong time im sure supposed one folk scared ride driverless elevator derek talked video
charliethesupersaurus dont see blatant hypocrisy speech baffling unreal
pdjinn someone may like one technology doesnt mean hate technology people simply dont want depend computer leave house
really cool tech simulation data incredible thing say dont like ugly vehicle get test bed item also need cover requirement range passenger goddamn theyre nasty look people gon na want convertible traditional looking door car instead minivan lookin thing hope diversify model range going forward
car might shiny new today however car whose inbuilt gps wont load boot error long loose solder joint snap sends one vehicle murderous rampage handing complex possibly dangerous task machine like torquing carbon fibre cam shaft look good fails catastrophically
long aging electrical connection cause glitch dirt bug bird poop degrade effectiveness relatively narrowaperture sensor
car driver waymo leaf antibacterial hand wipe driver seat
car might driver still vehicle get people around
car still need driven inside service center andor car wash people due covid
car driven ninja thats cant see still need antibacterial hand wipe
mean also see city bilaws might come place believable taxi required wet wipe driver seatbelt must engaged theyre complying law might affect even silly there driver theyre still taxi service lot law made human driver still apply
driver john sena see
pretty clear technology holding driverless car back regulation also sure economics yet either ie affordable least nonprivate use
holding back proven safe exactly regulator must shameless minute waymo advertisement gloss point entirely present time technology ready barely ready level absolutely ready level level decade away possible current technology want read indepth balanced analysis case read self driving car article gradient google link allowed basically current technology handle even fraction edge case happen level vehicle present one know build common sense module option train machine billion possible edge case regulator absolutely push back tech giant currently
unless sharing car people selfdriving reduce time yor car sits parking lot taxi operator managing car anyway improvement would marginal real difference would elimination need pay salary driver le time car spend nothing doesnt really make anything efficient need le car fleet still need produce rate
derek education even infotainment plain minutelong advertisement
car wouldnt last minute city like bradford uk manchester let see handle country road village road barely wide enough car ill think driverless car real
classic car love driving car road autonomous feel much safer taking
car road autonomous wont allowed drive
hero outlawing manual driving absolutely ever happen u least
mrmahn hope drive regular car forever think big push banned automated car allow insane amount surveillance safety good state pas
driving regular car illegal let make insurance expensive everything future real require use key pad even simply walking house
america centric
plot twist there invisible driver
think important statistic look many accident avoided thanks human supervising operator
seeing empty driver seat driving wheel spinning disturbing reminds oh case malfunction autonomous vehicle definitely inspire safety fully autonomous design possible human interaction road adapted maintained human driver paradoxical middle road stage frightening
dont get traffic would reduced car technically car road driving around
let still talk fault accident least whole eu driverpassenger car
rule thumb person car driven computer always fault
want fully automated car expensive thats real question going cheap like elevator ill sell car right going cost full tank gas every time make trip im buying hybrid next car
one easy reason automated vehicle safer stick limit one human driver road also would interesting know happens car automated sensor interfere
lift got back fancy hotel lift huge source frustration many people many reason cant get lift right
car loud even stopped
video seems like commercial objective video
yes waymo work fully mapped environment drop waymo different city itll freak thats fully autonomous
driverless car solve traffic still chokepoint road maximum car throughput depends physical parameter car road real solution trafic public transportation want also made autonomous
oh didnt cover tesla fsd beta waymo car extremely local nearmaximum solution never scale tesla nn chip actually imitating human brain result astounding dude come
ultimately big tech company arent investing billion altruistic societal reason like safety whether source government incentive capital theyre interested extracting wealth data cutting staffing cost company others ten million job risk logistics lorry driver delivery people across supply chain lot already powerful tech company escape tax loophole partake dubious privacy policy arent giving back society scale extract technology isnt issue fact citizen arent effect stakeholder enough influence effect outcome endgame considering threat humanity face
theyre safe wearing seatbelt
vehicle driven computer im pretty sure accident would reduce
someone hack
robertcubm oh yea
itll never happen many variable
wonder stop run someone keep driving along set path sue artificial intelligence hit run
dont think human better driver need human putting line feel safe getting inside car

believe driving skill average statistic wok look people would average maybe confused median
sort thing possible small sample dealing large sample size measure tend towards bell curve distribution
underrated comment seems handful instance video statistic either misused misrepresented
craigmcqueen actually bell curve still work even roughly shape shifted driver higher skill
eluch everything bell curve
thortawar yeah except income distribution unless bell curve anything single peak relatively smooth
seems one hair fire lib video attempting present controversy none exists nobody wringing hand riding autonomous vehicle suspect driver couldnt care le autonomous driving vehicle whether theyre driving b already vehicle passenger dont watch road theyre called taxi uber bus train subway plane nobody question safety theyre time tested autonomous vehicle arent c least vehicle isnt anymore autonomous army people monitoring order schedule trip doesnt make convenient claim theyll reduce traffic congestion cost save planet also inaccurate single person vehicle dont reduce congestion anymore taxi mass transit system would reduce congestion weve mass transit century autonomous driving capability probably double cost vehicle worth equivalent cost buy two vehicle e thing called free market new technology work make economic sense provides benefit andor increase productivity market market alowed decide dont need hair fire far left wacko unelected illeducated beauracracy like think world going end year dont stop climate soemthing billion year dictating everyone pay something feel good
youve convinced legally blind person meet tech
one small issue thought stem rainn saftey course took uber everyone work uber got even working uber eats basically unless there someone car necessarily watch car watch people car company putting trust people getting car almost much trust ask
except unlike ted talk folk richard branson recognize madness disassociating human misery created automation well benefit economics ten thousand trucker longer able support family known externality well externality making life unlivable whole planet except billionaire need government tell people occasionally worth profit
want autonomous vehicle road dont want one dont live city dont think itll work vehicle dont trust company government build system override make vehicle vehicle however think many people shouldnt drive many people cant drive great
rolling stop
would lidar affected every car using would issue interference
yes catastrophically done right way distinguish pulse light send v source light pulse encoding example however still unwanted signal need filtered performance degraded focused beam light pointed sensor detector may saturate may blind extremely brief period time disclaimer im lidar researcher working draper opinion represent employer

want drive
cant happen soon enough
would like manual car removed road self driving car safe enough mean safe enough got manual driver let say get accident self driving car accident safe enough word way safer manual driver let say manual car removed road accident would probably drop near since self driving car would able detect none would speed drunk driver think future want drive manual track
car available east lansing would like try
nothing available east lansing
great video derek like analogy elevator effort put many party suspect probably see happening next five year lady said wouldnt great
morally responsible consequence action conciously decide take know driverless car safer block use responsible death prevented autonomous vehicle yes people may stil injured die instead blaming autonomous vehicle injuring people perspective understand actually saved far life
find trolley problem silly many human sitution choose going die getting injured many situation could avoided driver would paid attention could seen
trolley problem phillosophical question
people still gon na drive ex reach office leave home min drive rash reach destination
drive offroad rally one
imagine autonomous car zombie apocalypse youd screwed
unlikely scenario
favorline entertaining idea
mappapetts np
know also make human error engineres make car algorithm
would rather good public transportation tbh
need circumstance public transport better
think driverless car road safer also able communicate even information
nah man current driverless car would make accident casualty bad driver camera rely make ton mistake theyre practically blind sun hit camera directly least year
driverless car awesome sure trust ai current stage development autopilot eco friendly car would norm though hopeful
people think better average better average
car catalogue please refrain touching steering wheel circumstance
love veritasium content concept autonomous car however feel like argumentation part video biased someone else pointed person academic experience one would expect critical approach even though clear aim video encourage people like idea autonomous transportation specific im buying part state better average driver would justify widespread usage fully autonomous car seems core argument video preventing silly human error caused driver distraction ie driving straight onto stationary vehicleobject driving road speeding driver fatigue mentioned common problem affecting road safety achieved cheaper convenient introduction fully autonomous vehicle fact modern car prevent error using lane assist blind spot assist lidarbased autonomous braking system etc furthermore currently eu requires lot system added every production vehicle system already proven effective term reducing overall road fatality thus properly justify point general use autonomous vehicle compare average driver driving modern car equipped modern safety feature mention general costeffectiveness convenience think fully autonomous vehicle really future future commercial transportation personal become widespread cost hiring driver higher maintaining fully autonomous vehicle
sensor get obstructed snow sleettheres lot around world
world outside california nyc far tech startup concerned nyc snow problem union successfully oppose selfdriving car anyway
well windscreen wiper thing already engineer come device drive car around city id imagine design rubber blade arm wipe sensor clean
stuc didnt notice rotating sensor mirror
would car camera technology work le favorable weather condition example snow storm heavy rain might block view camera
even though im driverless car got idea extreme weather effect infrared night vision added dont know would guess build car found solution working hard matter time
favorline bad weather make harder self driving car sure also harder human drive thick fog heavy rain autonomous car still better sensor human
kolupsy driverless car would probably also lower speed human dont
lidar baybeeee lidar heavy rain n snowstorm n weather condition earth cakewalk infrared light pas thats exactly plane mentioned beginning could land
yes sensor would likely affected would likelihood still better human sens add antonymous car likely talk know another speed direction could avoid car virtual white scenario would know say accident site ahead well sensor could detect make appropriate action
good stuff computer operate aircraft im pretty sure handle driverless car road good condition bad stuff road america suck
laugh african
driving much harder much le freedom move around obstacle
car sound way isnt ac person thats ac computer
reminds thought human arent anywhere near performant computer insanely efficient compared computer brain pretty crazy calculation considering run watt wonder first decidedly nonautonomous job going meaning could automate decide worth human way efficient
spookyhoobster capable making calculation relatively quickly make calculation fundamentally flawed brain conclusion based many approximation based imperfect data input computer come order magnitude accurate answer day day brain work great although instance extreme import computer simply better scale large number calculation
spookyhoobster indeed every neuron brain connected every neuron brain would connection atom observable universe synapse network network brain neuron change time new connection formed connection part efficient become thing require part handeye coordination one kind connection domain process called neural plasticity human come back stroke even catastrophic brain damage fwiw think automated job create automated ton thing human today inefficiently personally im thinking electronic medical recordkeeping could build robotic job around new kind work person sits writes read writes could automated away
think least noise actually spinning lidar
yet see purposeful sabotage selfdriving technology selfdriving hit critical mass sort sabotage surface going extremely difficult tend lidar opticallybased navigation system great used theyre good particularly good route planning positioning grand scheme thing especially thousand million car road
one sad thing probably people working driver would happens
huge challenge society going face fairly soon driverless lorry truck definitely way soon start deliver good around country let face vehicle drive hour end without stop massive incentive freight company cab driver etc face uncertain future
stuc reminds textbook example whole sector becoming irrelevant urban horse feeding caring disappeared people move car back dereks example elevator driveroperator maybe collateral damage inevitable every progress sigh
firstly pilot dont use autopilot landing challenging condition high wind secondly completely failed address change behaviour human driver around autonomous car example congested city know car coming going stop could pull every time may get abused heavy traffic disappointing video
yep standard behavior driverless car known human take advantage like using predicable motion npc game real life im hurry car coming toward driverless im going know lock brake immediately pull risk screw rider car get thrown forward
believe heard tesla reported statistic injury death accidentsin car major law suit reguarding
well used like video sound like cheap car sale man promotion ai technology pulling emphatic card great people disability cheap
wait software vehicle hacked malicious actor tell much would trust least quickly fix malicious driver
allow remind million people die car crash every single yeareversingleyear
thesmart survival fittest natural selection still occurring human being
thesmart problem death count ability cripple city entire region literally everyone one
rydaddy take upvote get hell
ihazplawe isnt already crippled think car might help reduce
great work cant wait ride car
game changing driver
let proper testistanbul saturday morning
driverless car wont survive day indian road
id love see stuff like rolled world wide people use like seeing something like south east queensland sunshine coast gold coast range seeing kind stuff brisbane would really cool depending price system id use get uni rather taking bus train itd basically half time travel removal waiting thing le needing go far double back along future exciting afraid taking wheel
concern redundancy something breaksgoes wrong hardware software selfdiagnose airplane assume stringent safety check people cant dont check oil tire pressure
energy consumption vehicle cpu gpus slam reason electric cost taxicab business cost compare normal driver guess one social conflict could problematic
driverless truck harder
way harder many dynamic involved
personally always vehicle drive whether car motorcycle enjoyment selfish part hope never get taken away
dont think many argument presented valid since plane fly controlled space elevator go either reason take plane elevator merely transportation purpose people would use mean fun substantial amount driver experience moreover true accident happen due carelessness high percentage driver becoming increasingly detached driving therefore bored focused making road safer making boring causing driver doze many factor determine severity frequency accident like car age well maintained something undoubtedly affect self driving car well would liked critical thinking applied video instead felt like minute fear mongering advertisement
cam flying
think driverless car taking insurance company afraid change may able justify charging ridiculous fee driver since would responsible accident something like got good thing going basically get free money people dont want ruin car manufacturer technology yet theyre afraid theyd lose market share hence company profiting people distrust new technology would surprised actually lobbying new legislation would allow autonomous vehicle fully employed work year far know nothing concrete done yet
future damn cant wait
would like know deal puncture refuelling
question whats price billion dollar
guess autonomous car pas test driving around new taipei city taiwan many scooter would like ddos attack computer vehicle
cab driver job risk
still driver seat car isnt waste space
system made happy path mind fully autonomous car work perfectly perfect condition ala real world perfect manage get huge number road itll safer ever human driver issue prediction model incredible predefined situation simply map every possible situation real life car become stationary case chance collision saw man pulling cart system seems working mentality wont hit anyone seem catering issue someone trying hit drunk driver distracted driver sleeping driver hitting wont hitting driver long human driver similar condition mentioned endanger autonomous car vicinity solution car seen far stop stop wont save car rushing collide program response imminent collision hit lead moral dilemma derek showed video motorcycle one decide hit conclusion car seem really good preventing accident vehicle concerned momentary distraction example might drive car road wall tree still save action someone else youll sitting duck waiting rammed confident build car handle response emergency well use ai algorithm task simple cold ifelse reasoning work need put
one reason cant get driver license either ineptitude taking test due medical condition granted take time regulation catch happen
okay driverless car work great gridlike american suburb well maintained road im convinced technology work well narrow italian alley mad vietnamese crosswalk lane indian city street
yeah wait vandal throw stone car
accident human dont decide hit panic hit whatever hit
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
network hacked good ai hacker converge entire fleet carry lethal attack pedestrian crossing school hospital etc unnamed country seems ignore danger firearm much damage could fleet hacked vehicle carry
great take ghetto please
car brand new computer glitch age function le perfect road system crowded place faulty traffic light
totally believe car better driver actually driving stressful ive waiting available could afford first thing im buying
thanks never want driverless car ill stick manual possibly auto
least good condition doesnt exist realworld driving might last take another year absolutely crucial
obviously biased video car may work fine controlled condition real test deal unpredictable road condition sabotage hardware software fault inevitable
im really concerned safety regarding hacker especially quantum computing coming cant hack human though think car general really much future want actually something climate change train way efficient everyone dragging ton material get somewhere alone resourceful concept
done unemploymenthunger across world
feel like whole video ad
every day around traffic see something make wish selfdriving car
natural everyone continue travel around time work would exactly worse cause auto congestion geometry personstrip solve smaller automobile fleet truly diversifying national modal share making safe child cycle school wonder includes parent like know congestion clear school holiday right
may help congestion changing shape car car derek steering wheel front seat dont need autonomous car really could develop vehicle specialized singleperson trip small fuel efficient save lot space road agree city need better designed bicycle pedestrian traffic public transit least selfdriving car wont murder intersection
mouse suit car better firefly
machine good killing job people world first human human competition men v machine machine win people creating machine ai machine learning also become unemployment year creating blockage future generation
slight tiny difference elevator car except car running alone single straight track
america waymo expert india waymo
one yet develop selfdriving car would chance indian traffic condition
cinegraphics yeah hope see soon
around million people die car accident year compare yearly death toll covid around million may ask many accident shouldnt illegal drive car train bus airplane take pretty much anywhere yet shitton car produced every day year car driver die youre younger year youll twice likely die car accident covid infection
wont work russia road hard even real driver
good mean technocrat wait little longer total surveillance control denies drive certain place keep road dangerous computer want maintain kind freedom thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
arent plane fully automated yet
car accident caused human error software bug also
human caused accident caused human thing matter software bug cause le crash human error
excellent comment let forget hacking
happi ever used computer noticed bug disappeared nope didnt multiply like roach complex system bug also deliberate security hole making car hackable instead stealing data criminal may kidnap car take wherever order may problem related selfdriving car kid born year taught worry everything okay accept everything obedient
need replacing ice vehicle ev answer thats still waste resource like said time vehicle sat parked need every vehicle fully utilised youre using someone else way dont need many vehicle road make better use time one big problem need accept though still people killed road work le going take autonomous vehicle longer accepted anything else
next decade may even figure go around traffic cone
u metropolitan road prefect case study selfdriving car nice road clearly defined lane wonder technology hit road outback non paved road contaminant snow slush road compromising friction foggy condition think condition would require form gyroscopic input well
ooh yeah let put million people work make cant go anywhere unless car allows
really looking forward automated car talk get traffic working together minimise accordion type acceleratebrake pattern get traffic could car slightly slowing response condition mile ahead adjust traffic flow
put car nordshleife computer able control car even tire let go mph held wagon mile dirt losing front right tire kmh manjis car still drive ai cant shouldnt drive
elon musk promoting waymo
human permitted drive unless emergency service people police paramedic firefighter etc driverless vehicle reach sufficient level reliability let revoke driver licence idiot behind wheel
cool still way polluting public transportation sustainable scale
idea able go drive ur car stupid since fun drive ur car autopilot activating u want nice
jane yo check vid fun driving yes autopilot cool sick dont want future vehicle none drivable human else il stick age car till die
everything cool people like hack car like movie hacker could drive ur car rgt
great video technology behind car seems advanced techonology behind car definetly amazing probably future human transport think format individual transport like car rethought like know great personal space car moving around im wondering much better road would future autonomous bus tramway train etc le car
insecure whether follow dream combining passion physic film making together vlogging youtube youtube trending subscriber inspiring many people including see world different way unique way learn science come long way sir derek wish best life hope continue making science interesting everybody
one annoying unpredictable factor left technology safe human
tech trollhacker heaven already investigated becomes widespread malicious actor abuse easily
incident involving waymo vehicle pedestrian ok thats serious three waymo vehicle stationary pedestrian ran vehicle nvm
good advertisement right
seraph yh even pause saying lol
unfortunately technology never going entirely eliminate human error road lot people driving much fun give
want see porsche get hand tech make autonomous car try break nurburgring record feel like computer running thousand year simulation figuring perfect acceleration way take corner high speed would absolutely crush human record forever would separate category
behind autonomous vehicle thing tomorrow id sell car today hate driving waste preciously limited valuable time technophile transhumanist technology well save end
fully autonomous car great car autonomous theyre surrounded chaotic random nutjob human driver forget
dont think ever happen least next hundred year order reality would allowed drive car road think many people least would want opportunity drive non selfdriving car wont real thing

driverless car future one day criticise governement drive deep country side govermment new president alexandra occasio cortez wow since new world order place dc turn switch left alone pm minus north dakota milles away house january rd happy new year stupidassium
sooner better say cant wait get wasted commute time back
know whats gon na happen like year road full electric mostly self driving car like modern tesla autopilot there gon na im gon na year old ill long white beard ill drive bmw e kid amazed sound na l v make
steering wheel
bird poop camera xd mean would love see ai interprets
year send clone work autonomous car self isolate zombie apocalypse
great video im autonomous vehicle principle dont doubt technical capability exist definitely average human driver however wonder societally feasible ultimately responsible something happen manufacturervendor owner even make sense allow individual consumer purchase autonomous vehicle software update maintenance absolutely required best use vehicle would probably larger entity providing supervised fleet use public transport etc really solve problem today traffic first foremost need reduce number car general effort involves use autonomous car thats great going enough public transport doesnt see huge investment expansion around
said thought actually driver average bad driver lower average
average better think donningkruger effect
hit horrible voice old hat russia impressed technology wish fully autonomous car although fully autonomous ability good function
getting point traffic efficiency would take long want better public transport infrastructure autonomous bus sure thing
question need car automation le car efficient train subway think much impressive technology going wrong direction
train useful big city one city another le car self driving
therunners think metro subway city useful efficient car car better company make profit etc
dsgio yes big city useful small city train always empty cheaper drive car
therunners think metro system public transportation efficient use technology basically taxi small city maybefor taxi useful make difference think main motivation technology profit car company serve public
dsgio nothing wrong company make profit deliver good service people pay thats service public win win germany train rural area sometime people one train inefficient costly
wasnt giant waste energy move ton metal one person comfort
id trust driverless car tbh trust machine drive think many different human error driver possible doesnt cover anything example person try cross road look way already embrace walk drive didnt see car sensor see human car standing side road obviously car still better reaction time human another example wont see person waving go first otherwise example block road said robotrobot interaction fine since could interact humanrobot interaction doesnt give much trust
min im thinking usual thoughtful analysis sponsorship really important channel
seems like public service announcement rather exploration science
liked reflection video
shouldve made collab mkbhd video
another way say human fuked robot future
pedestrian accident really illustrate stupid people including lol id love driverless car driving boring dangerous id rather drive race track
feel like biggest dilemma situation really car end hitting assignment liability suppose hit human driver seek compensation legal system find fault case automatically driven vehicle collision someone somewhere need take liability itll law society general determine liability assigned programmer implemented neural network liable company setaside insurance fund pay accident made network unavoidable situation ie pedestrian run front car company still liable decides seems like next biggest problem tied regulation solve
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
lv probably company made mean person control
mean video showed test theyve collected plethora data regard accident selfdriving car involved given camera sensor etc tell much accurate tale accident came human witness therefore anything determining legal liability easier depending live plenty insurer company liable accident kind scenario using lack evidence legal technicality loophole avoid accountability modern society possible
likely bundled every ride fare insurance fee compensate rider car damage encounter car passenger folk outside car fleet company would treat like commercial vehicle accident
scififan wait
goofy lookin tesla headass
better improve infrastructure walk amenity self driving car cool
minus f blowing snow black ice blinded oncoming headlight busy highway pm night time could go wrong thee thousand scenario ready test metal driving
hacker fun
im thinking country lane uk wondering well waymo would adapt sort situation side road sharp corner road user going stupidly fast around blind corner kind thing itll need whole new set billion mile driving experience manage
awesome algorithm boost
im pretty sure derek make equally good video con driverless car
id much happier driverless fully autonomous car human driving human dangerously unstable unregulated untested real sense kill many thousand year total brainer
purely infomercial much claim video complete nonsense yes car got much training data human necessary ai still learns much inefficiently human data equivalent year human driving picture rabbit enough recognize new picture artificial neural network need rabbit photo also unlike ai understand context environment move know garbage used expected movement pattern around look like also know kid neighborhood like gather play react accordingly case anything neutral video weighed pro con realistically reflected stage development
side might probably lead loss job taxi driver hope opportunity still coming along way
maybe likely soon main problem lot ppl wont buy partly ppl want drive partly self driving car like complex thus expensive buy maintain think would ride future mean massive scale decade away
car need lidar camera dont lidar
cyclist pedestrian couldnt even avoid stationary object human really freaking stupid
innovation normally benefit consumer additional financial cost fail see wont become accessible affluent first create unequal system road idea could make thing cheaper real science fiction
look pandemic every country state went gut reaction bombastic leader poorly leader give ego let computer model projection make much better prediction need done
youre wrong period
congratulation watched min ad
varitasium always rock
invest money public transport essentially thing
said right perfect condition technology problem perfect condition comparatively easy dreaded edge case bad condition unforeseen event make extremely hard implement thing autonomous car peace software correctly car autonomous probably work quite good long majority car driven people long million pedestrian cyclist motor rider participating traffic dont see happening didnt even start talking maintenance cost fr fancy sensor liability question security issue horrifying
man video still alive crashed white top lorry lying left lane road
tesla waymore real world driving data waymo
none information video unbiased would also liked consideration insurance liability fully autonomous vehicle involved crash liable software manufacturer etc good enough say collision wont happen really sidestep trolley problem unlikely guess sponsorship mean dismiss ethical though experiment
tesla first get full self driving almost every real world condition unlike waymo operate geofenced area im waymo anything let realistic
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
youre even allowed drive tesla using phone
somebody get man million subscriber
going fully driverless car better transform road kind levitated rail way
mannn video couldve really cool wasnt ad weimo oh well

dont think people self driving vehicle people issue system claiming able actually would happily hop one waymo car trained handling specific area well google risk averse waymo cant said system claiming level fully expect highway driving become fully autonomous couple year already massive leap forward
lot benefit could also achieved walkable city planning robust public transportation
love used metric
based thumbnail going ask since tesla billion mile driven superior driverless tech drive increasingly anywhere v waymo needing premapped grid saw sponsored waymo please sell
ugliest car ever seen
responded twitter poll felt like year much wasnt another option year
im worried driver losing job besides wouldnt driverless car make human worse driver right
traffic balet great pedestrian need use intersection would also much beneficial autonomous bus car want le car road driverless car
wtf even bot
better tesla
car waymo tech mine
video address actual question technology
""
utarch computer vision expert sure current sd tech correctly understand traffic situation possible edgecorner case looking sd accident date know caused sure wont happen responsible crashed caused full selfdriving car overseeing development sd capability making sure unfinished sd never hit road
im still curious see autonomous car react work road white yellow orange line messed need drive opposite side road work road speed limit wasnt visible hidden truck also current level car still confuse exit ramp speed limit main road speed limit level car make difference
metro also self driving better environment economy traffic space efficiency city
take hard pas driverless car system number reason instance workforce redundancy phaseout would massive hit world economy compared elevator operator typesetter wordprocessors according bureau transportation statistic bts driver make u workforce many job require degree unskilled worker going go even dont care job loss would greatly impact u economy dont world statistic would guess developed country would experience similar problem issue liability doesnt seem worked human error whose responsibility two computerdriven car crash manufacturer programmer maybe software update didnt automatically download install payforplaydriver mode bad enough car cost must twice original price add extra least thats car interested virtual dlc dont update software car take long live remote area transportation security wellinformed determined thief always ability steal car least thief generally physically present interested car stolen eastern european rd rate hacker also imagine hijacking automated car company got information stolen car ugly enjoy driving mitsubishi evolution x mr im interested autodriven corvette would take fun driving carie would driving car absolute idiot would buy exotic sport car summary technology may like lightbulb last hundred year business business screwing customer current computer market prove warning turn car smartcars reason top reason reject notion selfdriving car
people news say though youve never seen defcon video think one technology probably let mature hit mainstream
even year cant drive indian road
problem autonomous vehicle theyre ready prime time yet year darpa grand challenge theyre ready know going happen
best place test india
itd shutdown nanosecond able understand driver behaviour
cant wait live world everything precisely calibrated efficient robot together room error derek dont get wrong good scientific communicator man lil bitch everything status quo want dont care car driven people road cause accident could one day victim okay certain thing remain subject human error arent perfect specie dont need way uncritical stuff like make feel like youre mouthpiece whatever billionaire large mansion want
think autonomous car get safe there le idiotic human driver
ya wrote something like driverless car would get safer safer le manual driver road since le stupid people breaking law stupid action phone eating
favorline autonomous car could able interact eachother camera fail whatever itll still fine
im self driving car future havent started driving yet try first going fast
youll time theyre talking implementing driverless car major city anyone life minute outside major city still drive road outside city dont curb street sign driverless car use know gps get close still need local vision know
want selfdriving car future say year
remind u go floor
definitely level scrutiny expected veritasium topic go deep anyone thats looked practical fact many angle undoubtedly conclude driverless car cartech industry biggest brainwash fooled superficial motivation technology weak flawed reasoning corporation use convince merit
love reference getting elevator cant wait self driving vehicle everywhere
think car received task safety vehicle wouldnt ride anywhere
fukin dooouche
im legit terrified get vehicle parent id trust driverless car day
car controlled criminal hacker foreign power ill intent
oldplucker still better aunt nail driving
selfdriving car isnt new concept since forever first called horse could find way home owner drunk called taxi sit behind never touch control car take wherever tell computerized version traditional version harder hack
cinegraphics completely different horse get scared capable making error taxi driver still human make error computer make error human make impossible happen
mom pretty safe drive dad though
million men working driverstaxitruck usa wonder margaret thatcher shut many working place

wait till piss machine
aww man tempe shared city moment time amazing
would almost impossible bring technology india road bad also body follows rule drive wrong side road dont even follow traffic light frustrating real test car want future proof
responsible driverless car hit something police stop ask driver license charge fine pas red light tip sit driveless taxi
canada let see thing handle winter impressed
sad see many people believing waymo closer true driverless car tesla approach couldnt different company waymo release detail much cost team behind scene lidar geomapping area updating virtual map etc tesla solves issue whole fleet ready go one update
yeah mimic dumb driver best
shitty driver ill buy
well every airport cat allowed time system malfunction witch case would different approach runway using instrument pilot case complicated machine fail need someone land plane
oh boy anecdotal evidence
le much trust much enjoy driving wouldnt want give driving better safety margin lot people use car transport dont think automated car could ever really fill gap people enjoy driving even advent ev going reduce enjoyment many people love car overall think average person safer alternative
dont think driverless car gon na ready long time bit part still dont trust safety
sound harsh people still die somehow otherwise overpopulated least theory stupid one sadly sometimes kill innocent people process
phoenix profile bot getting much better
im one cant wait also unfortunately realistic ill seeing selfdriving wonder neck wood maybe year range roughly third year much paved road city snowed cant see road marking throughout entire country even inside top largest city major thoroughfare get snowed center line side line two clearish driveable groove free snow kept snow free traffic also lot dirt road everywhere im also interested marginal phenomenon lidar device function huge blizzard visibility human least seems le im saying selfdriving car couldnt handle thing since market would lot smaller part world would require lot real life testing experience gathering im guessing itll take quite year still company move away lucrative area start concentrate u
people going play ambulance noise phone troll
well great issue personally find autonomous vehicle computer hackable someone outside murderous intent could probably remotely break car end life hopefully thought stay fiction reality still able get car worry traffic great
hope get ride autonomous vehicle
need testing weather condition plane arent really good example still landing well lit runway without traffic happens town heavy snowstorm also insurance cost would need covered car manufacturer
neighborhood didnt tell
alsofrom first hand experience thing arent good news technology improvingbut experience riding one brake accelerate rather aggressively really dont like left turn reason also driving near road always kind scary
hacking done case like breaking u government computer using spy actually go contractor software inserting hack next update minimum way access car computer cant interfacing internet transmitted signal total air gap dealer enough security even access car hope one key people seduced spy blackmailed spy spy dont break plant thing company employee ever sick motive
may unimportant thing im say think anxiety feel entering one autonomous car least partially come fact youre looking normal car driver seat steering wheel see visibly obviously something missing driver naturally get anxious feel like somethings missing like suddenly get sinking feeling like forgot wallet even didnt became apparent showed footage firefly didnt feel anxiety looking interior even though felt plenty vicariously footage chrysler minivan firefly seat rider like rollercoaster amusement park there steering wheel driver seat brake pedal unconsciously sends signal brain say thats supposed well ok waymo vehicle start seeing steering turning confidently word also activates thought process mind one reassurance relief
yet elon musk still couldnt add autonomous vehicle la vega disco tunnel lmao nice see stuff work
dont feel safe nut
car guy included love driving
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
meanwhile vietnam self driving car give
video sponsored waymo really hurt authenticity
sponsored doesnt change data around self driving car self driving car waymo safer human driven car average
fortytwo im saying data presented false far likely thing way data selected skewed eg pheonix fairly well maintained wise road adding mile doesnt answer safety reliability question like rainstorm car follow police officer instruction avoid recent landslip dangerous thing walk home carefully analysing externalization risk factor would like derek independent view cant rely given sponsorship might well watch waymo ad actually already agree self driving car safer human driven car average sposoredness highly detracts convincing people
call journalism pay say thing think long commercial cant really trust say
welll think probe beta full self drive tesla compare
get better public transit u
technology good condition many american road good condition
nice another waymo video ive keeping emerging tech brew theyve done deep dive autonomy general autonomous driving specifically waymo future looking good
one point ive heard statistic half people think theyre average driver think true way people average number leg vast majority two tiny number missing one two leg would say driver drive sober lot average skewed small number also driving singular dimension task im likely better outback driving many way worse driving snow better driving left side road worse right people drive local neighbourhood local expert
disaster driving manually become illegal dor people driving fun one ever take away people
driving isnt going illegal time soon automated car driven car coexist year time youll either dead elderly enough get thrill elsewhere love driving many people driving chore
someone life rural area never work many dusty gravel road soft shoulder dirt road require human input fine dandy city folk u grow food stock feed dont force u like stupid mask
great video feel like need address issue proliferation bug whether hacked system learn billion mile driving road share information vehicle bug distributed linger within system month year write software living know ton ton bug product fix constantly mere fact writing code introduces bug computer controlled vehicle immune also security concern failed address could bring entire grid autonomous vehicle standstill someone right tool knowledge determination much complicated issue shown feel need discussion
need autonomous bus train
biggest ethical question around driverless car economics tech yes car road fast safe thats enough need make sure people displaced kind automation still get need met otherwise advance line owner waymogoogleetcs pocket
fully autonomous car suck mean dont whole idea city driven car suck want city built around pedestrian public transport car
u enjoy driving im never giving car ill never stop driving
fun driving full speed day care miss computer crash several airliner row pilot could override problem simulator error dont match reality thus cause problem completelyaccessibletransmissions death driverless car laser dont work heavy rain explain assume stop hit time rest crash plane use rain penetrating radar going happen thousand people die driverless car deliberately kill ever hit process certainly helped kill large number people today never mention prevent hacking dont either yet certain thing even shown current car hacked nasty thing done cant take aim car yet future aim car elevator cant hacked least point hope hacked freeze place run drone dont get used civilian life already mounted weapon isi iraq stoping iraq army till u came jammer matter time till people assassinated take airliner crashing loaded explosive fly engine intake non military specialized use drone banned
due sponsoring video waymo difficulty giving credibility content veritasium channel search forhighlighting truth exploration science based concept even name conflict commercial interest always red flag whether scientific publishing journalism politics given video talk personal safety daily activity partaken billion everyday try influence viewer regard sponsored technology safe find quite frankly unethical regardless convincing argument put forth video personal testimony maker integrity intention would better stay clear
car horizontal elevator
arent ready yet understand waymo driver behind wheel doesnt mean human isnt overseeing ride fully autonomous human actually charge even remotely sorry comparing av elevator reducto ad absurdum
hasnt service expanded hugely profitable think there going
map city car drive area well maped trained
really proud
automated driving future developed country poorer country impossshibuuuuru lidar would overload country philippine people crossing everywhere pedicab tricycle jeepneys dropping picking passenger vendor literally street dog street child people playing basketballadd pothole manhole without cover faded line much data
india ceat tyre run ad saying road filled idiot well drive good person driving around main cause accident need automation car driverless car car driverless human machine middle ground
c problem people like drive outragueous situation like unknown object road bump lead loosing control steerreng software problem power loss hardware disorder engine failre exmp people around acting unxpected way like video man cart car stopped really hard think possible trafic automated environment established car
understand outside scope video concerned normalization driverless vehicle seen solution problem traffic boring commute accident road thing true car centric city design suburban sprawl without adequate public transportation root problem autonomous vehicle implemented place human driver le safe happen alongside city redesigns investment public transportation accident happen public transportation done well enough funding public transportation way quicker driving good public transportation city center pedestrian friendly capacity road reduced people take subway train etc take look info city design amsterdam get sense mean amsterdam would absolutely benefit driverless car doubtbut would welcome addition well designed city full bike path various method public transport car overengineered solution problem car dependent city suburban planning let let bandaid larger problem said long live autonomous vehicle
veritasium long term viewer love bringing awareness self driving tech however really disappointed didnt even mention tesla vastly superior model self driving
actually pilot land airplane bad weather especially strong crosswind something autopilot equiped deal also collision avoidance system named tcas prompt u take control avoid collision aircraft get close lot pilot also experienced autopilot landing aborted due autopilot system making perfect landing situation autopilot land airplane low visibility since human need able see outside land manually
think serious issue mandating driverless vehicle come much control held populace small group people politician megacorporations rogue ai opening another road tyranny take hold
way automated driving like vaccination safer everyone including ride car driver
make wonder human evolution going like future machine everything thankfully wont around everything cost everything
ok got ta chrysler
fully trust autonomous vehicle never know program made car accident purpose speculation ai taking worry fully control ai autonomous thing trust vehicle right im trust
thing become normal definitely want thing like protecting
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
despite stance never completely trusting autonomous vehicle acknowledge place society make life much better disabled individual folk health condition make nearly impossible sufficient driver manually
one cant wait driverless car become norm hate driving
want high speed rail tbh
car hit motorcyclist helmet dont helmet umm car hit brake
sorry dude trust human instinct machine fail minute real judgementdecision making skill really long ad sponsor computer machine better human regard human could make judgment easier
wait year youre exactly like businessman saying hell walk flight stair rest life rather get driverless elevator
supernenechi public acceptance isnt excuse youre making blatant statement new norm year every single car driverless sound like cultist
wel lm sorry despite said human error doesnt happen time plane pilot help safer driverless car naaa going said car need perfect road condition traffic light working like test plane different condition need see car tested safe ultimate condition pas yes
fully automated car truck would great human driver plus machine driver recipe disaster europe automatic driving work city bug road sensible move remove car make city livable unlike america push car hungry suburbia
im glad still showed deficiency selfdriving car video car hard stop unnatural human driver would done obvious human watching clip cart pushing guy wasnt step moving vehicle software able understand
drive without touching steering wheel near future
making sure mission assigned term literally shout higher management slang xd
yeah gamification google ran nerd treat work even life one big computer game effective technique give great result super demanding high pace many google employee stay year experience switch company work sustainable pace
crsm management like attach bell whistels rather mundane everyday task make look interesting p doesnt work client organization literally chatting space named war zone space stakeholder would cry wheneven theyd face problem production system would others neck untill got resolved sad

pretty sure even billion mile road experience wont enough indian road
im tinking sensor would see car motocicle mph fast
start video happening way shape form end video maybe best going get accept happy
he claimingexpecting depends unfounded assumption even autonomous car available people want rely taxi service theyll still want car still parking lot driveway car itll great taxi company drop driver
huge stretch assume fatality start plummet people advocate enforce policy making mandatory company lobby seatbelt used optional public safety personal preference however impossible enforce rural area cant even get pizza delivered yet alone autouber
gmtr making self driving vehicle mandatory would never work unless government gave away car free many people saving scraping enough buy beater car hundred buck get work imagine much one driverless car going cost vehicle price already insane technology car make autonomous price going high cant afford tesla come close theyre still expensive average owner willing spend
gmtr really people go ballistic suggest slightest regulation gun think theyll give car greatly overestimate public concern people dying compared convenience
using w car wil cheaper taxi drive expensive driving car would logic
saying human prone distraction excusing u taking responsibility action make penalty dangerous obvious hooning phone driving drinkdrug driving following road rule near unaffordable
want driverless car second video way sponsored driverless car company
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
derek massive back log video watch understand isnt kind person mindless shill wouldnt make video didnt stand risked reputation
jynx he mindless shill
jynx generally agree sentiment still bad look could taken neutral stance video presented fact would still positive driverless car aside also dont know someone going decide sell best general take sponsored video pinch salt

well waymo atonomous
self driving car amazing however personalized motion data people gathered technologicaldigital monopoly lack social technics drive thing safely
need tethics
take pride knowing rule road unless youre passing stay left lane driving safely proper following distance using signal looking far ahead paying attention driving manual transmission vehicle enjoyably engaging way getting around black american man really excited police lose excuse profile driver world
driverless car may cool think forgetting public transit exists even easier automate much smaller footprint physically carbonwise

theyre great right theyre cant handle back road arent going everywhere ever

talk grandchild back get driving licence drive car funny part rotate something called steering get direction right kid mean wheel noo something different
tech work well certain condition isnt ready yet
know maybe hear maybe ready work place meet condition
human driver also dont work condition also theoritically impossible make ai work condition even driverless tech advanced eliminates one road death worldwide year still wouldnt adopt think statement way black white
lolwat tech limitation
cant compare ai experience hour human experience hour human learn much quickly due general intelligence
elevator horrible example arent professional elevator racer hundred million fan elevator collector garage full elevator elevator fast exhilarating operate
people criticize video forget one small detail driverless car dont need safe need safer human driver
mass adoption need better across condition median human driver hell lot safer mean human driver
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
yes car people enjoy driving use car oh well first hack deliberate driving driverless car school get dream getting rid car except true real area
tire get punctured would replace tire wait someone change tire middle nowhere
dont get distracted driver play siren sound

im jeremy clarkson put engineer passenger driverless car reach top death road without engineer pooped ill buy one also autonomous vehicle going bullied long human exist human factor continue element matter pedestrian motorist passenger video also didnt mention vandalism happen place like city skateboarder knock mirror slash tire happens graffiti windshield see working suburbia foreseeable future american suburb little sidewalk
sam sure come long way early day wendover production
surprised hear thats used sound like make sense got ta say kinda prefer dry monotone somewhat unauthentic sounding higher pitch rapidly changing intonation newer vids
finally captcha filled worth
survey show people believe average driver think wasnt said explicitly assumption hear often implication people cant average driver every time think course ofc reality lot fact average never understood fact often get framed impossible assuming could actually give score well people drive youd need would correct saying average driver average would
asked people abovemedian driver theyd explain people median mean theyd explain average mean would respond oh average theyd deal would say still dont see difference thing really make extremely dangerous driving drinking texting mainly would expect bimodal distribution accident per mile driven population probably slightly half belowaverage accident per mile average driver definition
think come blame something bad happen thats need erson drive
reaally hope take ive putting learning drive lol
hope public transportation u take bus train tram going better many people

dont support driverless vehicle im actually comfortable vehicle might become distracted vehicle get accident held liable im going risk driver license test technology law government change law see implemented everywhere
driverless car feel like video bit much bright side computer nice magic aviation introduction computer automation flybywire system made industry somehow safer also created new kind accident crash easily find example even past year badly programmed system complex automation badly maintained even computer relying bad data taking bad decision still aviation overall super safe ultimately feel like want aviationlevel safety driverless car need equivalent faa ntsb issue standard industry follow investigate cause accident happen
felt like advertisement car
funny people pushing driverless car yet seem antivaccine considering theyre wearing mask standing way apart
booooo know youre biased favor driverless car youve already done episode year ago
im little curious waymo car still steering whell front seat seems like sort thing youd want rip space
guess easier buy car upgrade kit designing building car scratch

there probably significant amount infrastructure need place widespread adoption self driving car road painted repaired street sign cleaned etc stuff seems minor compared amount benefit befall humanity system solved plus there economics work many idiot get car destroy mess yuk
instead measure could improve public transportation
useri sure could except requires public money autonomous vehicle infrastructure mainly funded privately maybe public money lion share nearly much public transit improve system thats year old scaling well
ok cheaper use driverless car great financial hiccup follow person know much cost probably significantly camera sensor got something dealership costing around truly magnitude safer people society whole would ideal vehicle heavily subsidized government make affordable would love see people make argument congresspersons however see instead subsidizing perhaps make real effort public transportation first u severely lag behind country thank japan making visit affordable easy

scififan wrong actually funny
jordigrau he got point though phone computer lot information already imagine big tech company literally control car given moment unless course law put place government know go rich elite lawmaker
regarding ethical dilemma easiest solution use random number generator make decision human decide instead random number would likely outcome would still worse amount incompetent irresponsible people driving unfathomable especially country like greece example met police officer duty saying go drink always get car drive get drunk rush back home get drunk concern autonomous vehicle technology available still people behind steering wheel
three law lethal david walton interesting scifi book subject

really like skilled driver aholes
everything else tech developed wealthy country welloff people ie place tend better manicured well maintained road wanted lety cavalcante address good technology suboptimal weather road condition personally driving part fun getting place people car appliance getting around easier faster efficient made better ill super sad day come road unsafe drive manual botcars taken cant deny life itll safe monkey steering wheel never really great
fully believe autonomous car safer manually driven vehicle safety increase exponentially vehicle become autonomous main wildcard safety autonomous vehicle unpredictability human driver le flawed human driver safer autonomous vehicle become fully believe someday major commuter highway relegated autonomousonly eventually manual vehicle considered rv wont allowed public road rural road closed track bit sad people enjoy driving pleasure drive short term scenic drive commuting trip place manually driven vehicle major route someday maybe even lifetime still love riding motorcycle hate long commute city cant wait vehicular autonomy long dont take away rural road
want see happens mechanicalelectricalonic failure engineer didnt predict begin show year please dont tell autonomous car come expiration date
idea behind driverless car isnt buy one buy ride need car need upgrade fix maintenance anything else personally deal company like netflix upgrade server idea happens background

car person stress much would like veritasium allowed science think driving yr never accident love drive depressing dont think people understand depressing imagine one calming thing life getting taken yaa get safety maybe mandatory crappy driver like u need updated driving test
ow shoot
really enjoy driving actually know better average always convenience
majority journey joy driving drive van living see job becoming non existent year maybe le technology automate job available real obstacle consumer resistance legislation making legal cost tech ill another industry retired future employment going challenging significant portion current job going automated education going even important ever kid generation childrens generation job market going super competitive see unemployment realistically rising

worry bout hacker autonomous reliability
worried dont think know hacking work

must watched total recall thousand time growing never thought id see honest god johnny cab real life need get robot torso deliver sassy dialog drive around
selfdriving car human thought arent using signal either
used signal didnt play clicking sound inside would nobody inside need know theyre turning
completely ignored real reason dont want driverless car company authority shut entire fleet anytime want there also privacy security issue well
dont think technology keeping coming le year thing keep becoming widespread money public perception video help nd half first isnt money buying car people wanting keep personal car dont pay outside party transport granted enough infrastructure even idea would become irrelevant incorrect however happens people going cling personal vehicle germaphobe mask germx covid pandemic p im downplaying pandemic im making correlation hint dark humor hate even put comment know dont make addition though someone going try invalidate comment saying downplaying

ill drive thank
""
fun fact still possible people believe average driving right average ten zero would funnier people believed better median
fun fact also possible fact average driver would even say probable consider donningkruger effect
find person driven lot hasnt close call whether fault fault another person get distracted bad day computer dont
get hacked
computer complicated one dont see doesnt random softwarw breakdown point sometimes stuff decide stop working dont consider close minded dont think yet autonomous car
maxwilson evidence would see believe also human regular car random breakdown difference car would probably get checked often
ive running without reset car accident might add half century show first computer right dont think mind im ear computer software business thats im asserting talking neck pal
yup ive almostaccidents road year ive driving either distracted driver nearly hit scary hell really helped dispel old concept better average driver im average wait spend commute car thats lot better average human already use autopilot model freeway driving hardly perfect need attention require give doesnt work great surface street
theyre prone hacked essentially end sth much problematic even talking rare hazardous scenario like solar flare em related interference
function intended
great video thanks work put bring attention even though sponsored
telsa going one better come self driving drunk driver simulator insult cop faster normal driver toyota wont done elderly driver simulator end year
everything peachy find cut corner max
idea people keep bringing car protect accident thing think often human driver need decide hit kid old lady dont human roadway traffic rule setup avoid scenario likely driver encounter pedestrian ie suburban location speed limit set low driver enough time stop someone suddenly run road rule helpful preventing automated car getting accident human driver take consideration car behave unlikely scenario occur ridiculous people think huge insurmountable issue stand way technology adopted
like autonomous carsone whats fun second knowing people system believe created ser e love fear slave e never make anything best interest mind suck discourges u something cool technology thinking would ok riding autonomous elevator car elevator direction car take u anywhere want autonomous car lose autonomy go anywhere want feel band certain place worse might authorize place go need probably good blind people feel doubtful technology anything feel confident precision technology trust possibility control turn autonomous car potentially signing severing freedom
waaaaaana drive lol tho like idiot road would much better
believe car human
speed actually cause percent accident
doesnt fit narrative speed thing thats easily measured punished
nah many motorist speeding time lot tailgating lol plus speed kmh inherently unsafe need limited main road one reason netherlands safe serous injury death expect mode diversification sustainable safety police adopted speed limiter instead av tho eu mandating soft limiter new car people pissed yet people excited av lol tech decade implement claim av feel like another bigtech distraction
im autonomous car want drive car actually enjoy driving
know safe matter time able driven designated road everything automated rip country living
recently took wager issue following challenge show waymo solution autonomous driving universally applicable show able ship waymo undisclosed foreign country place newly opened winding road go populated area operate safely
people rely car first year car ageing camera work laser beam stopped working properly year might answer change camera laser beam case want think happen camera laser started malfunction middle road
want stress tested driven clean clear cut road respond idiot cutting suddenly unexpected scenario digitally road basic thing everyday driving think show people would confident
thing joy driving vehicle legally required automatic entire car community go extinct nobody would ever show interest car would therefore le cool car company like lamborghini would reside making track automatic race car track manual car would trailered hope entirety car existence least people love car allowed drive fun
pretty cool using bat dolphin technology make human life comfy
many driver like pretty sure bad driver daughter know driving like say first thing told taking single time driver lesson took road narrow drive driving daughter place going alone car never take driving lesson
imagine police officer pulling one car w someone inside something like signal light swear im passenger
really police regulation service simply know exactly going dont like deviate car straight detention centre go appointment thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
scififan worry well basically car monitoring every single thing everywhere go privacy whatsoever
scififan pas go collect
next one misinterpret comment supportoppose computer driven car proceed attempt lecture especially username like cc f reported
hooray human job
problem autonomy isnt computer problem human fear control taken away think often thing become automatic people often intentional jerk reaction knowing control taken one place another human feeling take control situation understand fine autonomous vehicle though worried people refuse let vehicle drive want someone something take control mindless driver irrarional unpredictable human constant variable computer vehicle constantly predict often vehicle crash caused human error
veritasium going tlak mrna experimental vaccine isnt long term tested forced apon everyone

well handle snow
question since car could connected outside risk someone hacking cause havoc
one question case unavoidable accident car protect pedestrian right crash wall left potentially kill car occupant protect car driver payed car ride know human would better tho reflex fill weard know car already know pick evenso life balance

cant wait hope get working uk road theyre pretty insane
absolutely totally long mile worst human endeavor innovation sake innovation purely profit figure worse know sock albert einstein foot often match intelligent people time fail simplest thing derek excused silly comparing driverless car elevator really
driverless car really awesome get safety benefit like driving much
id say driverless airplane easier driverless car sure plane move dimension car move two there lot le unpredictable human congestion air also think dont need achieve category autonomy car achieve widespread use category autonomy becuase biggest unknown variable ai isnt going able confidently predict going human side note someone drive truck living let alone decent grasp statistic work laughed hard people thinking average driver
youre gon na change title even clearly biased update title include sponsored thanks
yeah cant wait future need subscription get anywhere go authorized repair shop police state wont let certain car go certain location
maybe wont car lease instead either way raise good point
autonomous vehicle become common held responsible ie sued accident owner vehicle manufacturer short driving vehicle sued
capitalist hurt instead building selfdriving car drive work stop building suburb start building infrastructure dont drive time planet would thank u reducing emission rd least mega rich fancy acd selfdriving car burn death deg heat wave mean tech cool much effort maintain business usual business usual killing u expensive seat vehicle wasnt built never drive one
worth level autonomy vehicle imo
hmm hesitancy autonomous car actually car put bluntly stupidity people airplane good example airplane le similar degree autonomy importantly communicate directly indirectly however drunk people crossing around one imagine bird collision similar phenomenon hand ground amount data processing car need make account non normal behavior big confident yet people walking slowly drunk jaywalking distracted driver etc didnt like way derek dismisses autonomous car third world country kind scenario autonomous car actually going make difference
doesnt cyber security become large problem autonomous car someone virtually hijack car hacking technique
autonomous car lot safer car autonomous le likely error occur
edit good cant see seam cut stick
sad animal killed car taught concern car
biggest hurdle simply trusting selfdriving car statistically safer thats
thats thinking statistic clear death injury car driver due large number dont recall much mention video relative statistic driverless car size driverless sample
derek know specific parameter sponsorship video description need know level creative freedom
love vibrating pole seat
want vehicle replace bad driver good one
hmm anticipate new kind mugger prop siren vehicle get people car pull interesting probably thing become integrated drop encrypted radio signal identify emergency vehicle
feeling like luddite technology never problem economics advancing technology mean work le get average person doesnt get benefit get laid find even meaningless job waymo make road safer free people labour drive pursue worthwhile fulfilling thing waymo also get obscenely rich often unionized transportation industry get completely gutted million people go unemployed
neglect mention vehicle exclusively used city heavily premapped million mile driving city well
winter snow either happens half camera covered snow happens driving condition much worse normal due ice car know potentially much dangerous drive take account driving speed
youre gon na late n wan na go fast
show short movie different autonomous vehicle reacting avoiding accident
one major thing car like cant take away driving fun driving fun driver alert interested traffic car make driving condition car safer dangerous driver dont want driving worst afraid driving
let hope doesnt happen nascar would boring show

capitalism
im glad non driver wearing seatbelt
desperate driver area send car way could use themid issue riding autonomous vehicle
say disappointing one two three people hit stationary vehicle walkingjogging speed
im sold ready
dont get distracted driver play siren sound
""
human indeed stupid thing
""
see prankers playing random siren
jursamaj would carry charge imporsonating emergency vehicle effective deterrent
imagine getting pulled cop seeing driver passenger
seems sad investing much time money driverless car instead better public transportation id also like see video actual problem car silly trolly car problem enough resource sustain human driver autonomous vehicle already running computer part playing video game world wont able support million car camera computer part required analysis car need good clearly labeled road wed invest even road car roll instead better transportation method worth investment new autoonly road human arent allowed actually take full advantage technology many car need internet access bugfix process computer power collectively learn one improvement scaled million device one bug one hack also scale million device many auto require internet access mean vulnerable large scale attack news large scale cyber attack growing every passing year im big proponent reducing human driver think insane million human basically sacrificed order u get place faster schedule dont want end world people rich enough afford car live city infrastructure support get benefit
also way le car city bike pedestrian tram instead
city continue dystopian space slowly surrounded city better quality life lol people careful becoming obsessed bigtech like happened remember demolished community highway said gon na build home top lol
cdehwler cause germany watched lot bike know anyways
show avoid dnagerous situation caused purpose road rage driver react maneuver high speed car going stop freeway mess much crowd slowly push another lane cant believe dont even begin address basic problem im glad im hyper aware every time take wheel car path forward urban sprawl unsustainable
people seen driving make happy coming want self driving g car
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
scififan talking safety selfdriving car definitely help selfdriving car like elevator automated thing need constrainedcontrolled environment consideration freedom surveillance would depend implementation though need know youre really losing term freedom really dont like idea monitored know way
driverless car theyll invent technology allows human walk talk work anymore soon well everything computer including sex owning driving car use mean freedom guess anymore
yeah getting fully driverless train idea would sci fi would never happen
many road death road rage youre missing biggest issue distraction nothing compared road rage
issue driver trying drive paying attention phone radio air window etc instead trying thing driving prioritizing driving everything else
shouldnt anything else driving order doesnt matter
avid cyclist ive encountered several nerveracking instance distracted driver crossed bike lane id feel safer expert computer driver
thats ironic almost got run tesla autopilot walking across street neighborhood last summer normally car slow approaching traffic light walking near power gone signal light tesla autopilot flew past signal without slowing course really driver fault looking downwards phone still terrifying computer cant recognize traffic light
future sustainable safety policy netherlands bigtech distraction real safety gain improvement quality life
future future better public transportation electrically powered clean renewable source fully autonomous sure selfdriving car people board improve traffic fluidity shortterm sorry argument marketing
self driving still want car
ugh car cost buy registrate taxed mantain
go want waiting
theamboss fast deem condition allow cant override driverless car tell go mph speed limit want count freedom important safety
car driven human
reported dangerous act dangerous act promote weapon mass destruction wheel suicide booth far worse promoting making explosive home several order magnitude dream weapon future terrorist
""
hell spam bot
hell
question thing called car work ive heard constantly tv cant quite figure hamster running inside make wheel spin
yes exactly
would best software stop driver stupid thing like speeding duo look phone fail stop brake check
already freak someone else drive trust computer people think id still supertense travelling lol
judy yo check vid doesnt work gps already plane landing gps assisted system
quick statistic number found online may dont take im saying certainty plz calculate million mile arizona would death crash crash would put car higher rate incident per mile average human per statistic average driver amount mile would expected would relatively close coin flip whether wouldve accident led fatal crash
reliable aint road already elon genius musk wasnt even able make driverless tesla mile tunnel boring company dug la vega buzzword boeing max mcas computer good software thats need another window car need antivirus anti piracy anti car jacking anti ransom ware
people trust issue
tldr admit reliable let robot hardwork
doesnt even maintain large gap car finally talk coordinate others traffic ligts sign designed human
better yet car road
get one reasonable price purchase maintain im already cool concept
legally blind lacking independence driving vehicle sure hope driverless car become widely used accepted soon
think fully autonomous vehicle going ready go full use far sooner people let go full use hesitant feeling going used fact there going call tradition accident matter minor involving selfdriving car fully publicized thats thing work bad could really save lot life
cab driver realised redundsnt
yeah try putting self driving car prison ups sorry loss wife kid software glitch fix next update im sure letter ceo like take away grief bring family back car perfect faultless everything could prevent disaster according company policy sorry loss think otherwise sue u billion lawyer reliability bloody computer magic box show one sane person day age seriously belief software perfect faultless electronics never fail cant hack computer matter
completely selfish like drive car enjoy driving racing pretty much everything involved car enthusiast culture cool tech
cant give review company sponsoring
like driving car car drive city allow take control country would pretty cool would mean hope future end fully autonomous
long people like dont end antiautonomouscar rally
ok ok looking experience road car crash video air crash investigation video also would like computer control st driverless car involved accident casualty responsible owner wemo nd pilot required make certain number manual landing maintain proficiency car driver havent seen demo hi traffic wemo car la freeway lastly another nail coffin freedom freedom giant hi tech company controlling everything even want let continue give google co monopoly daily life one day cant even imagine
dont want driverless car thats personal opinion driverless semi never happen yeah got dumb as wheel holder job professionally requires much awareness back trailer tight spot ever tried bump dock foot long rig there foot dock edge wall made happen id love see computer written college major expertise trucking attempt
cool year driverless car achieved europe public transit usefulness still higher maintenance traffic road noise america beautiful
interesting note decided mention asiana crashing human input max crashing multiple time automation deciding plunge aircraft smoking hole ground computer immune making stupid decision still human wrote code
right biggest issue liability who blame pay insurance company agree automated road transportation accord sort manufacturer politician sell thats selfdriving vehicle get traction although initially ton pushback auto manufacturer personally cant hardly wait fleet sociallyavailable selfdriving vehicle various size take roadway fair view driving necessary task car ownership costly inconvenience dont romanticize behind wheel many issue could lessened nationwide fleet vehicle available sort notice reasonable cost ie le ownership insurance maintenance etc still ton problem living life within society issue moving people thing personal scale would diminished
car drive car refuse drive
bet people dont trust car would get car drunk friend word theyre ok drive
nice condition professor bring waymo ne usa let see handle one whiteout judge much swerve take miss giant pothole large road kill real driving condition like find sunny california got
concern driverless car overall think way good bad two concern follows number easy hack number know computer wear overtime would suspect driverless car would well sign look safety precaution failure lastly could practical everyday implementation mean everyone afford ferrari let alone general maintenance repair
dont know chief think id rather better train subway system
designed flight control system three dimensional travel relatively clear space ft agl business commercial aircraft presentation horrific computational power required supplant reasonable human mind far beyond presented video comparing autopilot described video alternative inebriated driver tantamount comparing video truth
im amazed comment say here real problem transition others say insurance problem problem isnt even addressed video waymo know issue problem network network safe breached period clear weather car fine sensor input point view follows program rule communicating server issue software breach ransomware attack rose nothing server level safe eventually became popular probably wont happen reason company could breach system control car cause crash could lock door could threaten life driving mph could threaten company running car road unless ransom paid thats first problem second problem american love drive unfettered unwatched totally free end spotty level random success nogo
elefant room happen taxi uber truck driver technology really come huge economic dislocation
problem autonomy carits dead technology
exactly need public transit
reason dont trust theyre perfect imperfect world people smart people stupid people panic people get distractedetc thing put danger even car know way drive others
stop animal crossing road though like could end increasing amount roadkill fairly large margin
ofcourse stop commenting actually watching video
know technically car self driving would wreck
way faith technology thing say certainty car selfdriving wreck would traceable machine error code hardware im sure swapping human error cause wreck machine error cause different half dozen six another changed type accident occurring le running parked car running blue wall blue vehicle look like sky
dont think itll become widespread time soon expensive moment
anyone else notice car never actually parked busy parking lot sort freaked saw close pedestrian stopped
ah yes pedestrian mower intersection dont want autonomous vehicle road dont want vehicle road need wean bloated society car dependency autonomous electric
love used overtake segment
think forgot thing called car enthusiast people like car driving
like blue cadillac passed front camera google car
probably right fully autonomous car year away probably always
un pas doubt
funny thing wished already exist cab falling asleep work forget traffic etc also comparison elevator plane worryingly stupid clearly click bait video hoping lot derek honest one biggest youtuber endorsing technology tick sheet kudos team contacted veritasium deserve raise sure
rose yo check vid yeah sure think driving car operating elevator almost thing right think dumb comparison otherwise smart ytuber commercial pilot would tell difference computer guidance engaged autopilot human pilot many airline trying decade replace human element still despite ai guidance fatal crash also system failure pilot skill proved necessary land craft see boeing max reference computer cause crash human tried best save plane maybe getting one day surely wont yet board plane without pilot copilot board applies taxi problem driver probably driving many year taking b love human conversation traveling guess busy darek introvert never unpleasant experience start looking alternative yet know coming yet neither technically built environmentally even word society overall example try system running rural dirt road mumbai
would happen ten car lidarscanning place time wouldnt interference
imagine autonomous racecars whoever best programming win race
thats kinda hack v hack server c source back day fun trying create best software sabotage method used others
done drove walmart live like minute away lol ironic almost got ran van heading back home walmart today watched another crash happen light exiting walmart
who fault
dont want future u genuinely enjoy actually driving andor riding motorcycle even sometimes mean dealing bad traffic high degree safety still implemented automated human driven vehicle interaction example bluetoothlike technology could create realtime communication mesh among vehicle fully autonomous well automated safety feature human driven vehicle react sensor simultaneously sensor nearby vehicle
accountability accident happen
im vehicle automation think advancement proliferation make world much safer place certain scenario come mind concern though say automated vehicle passenger anger issue pedestrian walk front quickly moving vehicle shouldnt vehicle come screeching stop short pedestrian throwing passenger coffee windshield drinking happens next
dont understand market type car think itd make sense advertise trucking company company would save money transportation cost havent seen autonomous semi truck
hate guy cant car hacked question asked
one important advantage human improvisation example see road worker holding stop sign treat differently see stop sign ground sign context make treat differently selfdriving car would see identical wasnt specifically programmed tell difference eventually infrastructure reorganized selfdriving car currently tailored human also waymo selfdriving car specifically designed one city unpredictable aspect traffic still impressive technology close waymo make seem
yeah heard train though
share people concern driverless car despite logic argument put time easily forsee future people look back aghast u allowing people pilot car around speed little way stop u killing still dont see elevator comparison though im nearly life exception lift operated user pressing button simply cant see anyone ever worried driver like lift suddenly veer lane go fast
misrepresentation plane astonishing science channel pilot guided computer relying computer take land showcased air accident one example eventually computer used many accident computer took created dangerous situation fatal accident remember strangely havent mentioned doubt computer good helpful human fact better judge situation act accordingly avoid fact video sponsored waymo certainly show
problem representative test reason phoenix right isnt legal consistently favorable driving condition anywhere country generally well maintained mostly suburban road le third many day rain national average le quarter total rainfall snow dont go downtown suburb close fortunate neglected mention car dont go road speed limit pull heavy rain one thing say dont need perfect every situation another entirely suggest driving tiny fraction ideal road ideal condition signifies anywhere close ready prime time let talk timeline suggesting anything le year complete pipe dream reasonable level adoption simple reason average car road today year old ok mixing average median surprisingly median hard find still cant buy one even fully autonomous car hit road today car anyone ever bought ever majority car would still human driver ten year percentage fleet see faster adoption percent american drive carpool mean going buy one still missing yet another problem even waymo van able drive road cant drive adverse condition cant drive highway speed dont sale arent nobody would able afford ceo waymo put cost single van around dollar earlier year sure happen one biggest company world make fleet average person even small cab ride share company forget love video never thought id calling one intellectually dishonest call year plus people like given pie sky click bait
wow look like one ran lady tempe
ok would safer autonomous car must ask something would happen put stage self driving car mass manufacturing company slowly start degrade product planned obsolescence take wheel failure computer andor mechanical part also want add fact since computer running thousand least million algorithm minute long term possibility lag could send car accident another area possible failure material transmitting data silicone overheating
cant ballet electric vehicle road car enthusiast people enjoy act driving people prefer manual transmission want hear sound favourite engine burning dinosaur juice interest electric vehicle full autonomy outside getting taxi im holiday dont car car enthusiast ever gotten sport car roar crackle change gear sweep corner corner good road even average road amongst traffic youd know youd never want go away sure electric car sporty dont make noise hearing exhaust spitting fire half even make good car fun drive future fiesta st isnt allowed public road sound like future want part
wait driverless car norm many stupid people road
part world people dont stay lane necessarily mean like u
see pakistan
lowcommotion india
phoenix specifically ton wrongway collision highway year sad
tesla ditching lidar using camera saying good enough lol bunch people die
think anyone owns self driving car essentially prohibited driving worst nightmare self driving car continue unable drive snow well future ten million human driven year idea theyre try snow driving winter drive handful day cause much death destruction traffic
get pull get ticket
would definitely like one long drive id like drive short distance still keep driving skill see big benefit people special need
everyone excited driverless car excited rockstars collaborated google get laser detailed real textured u even world size map gta
wish id known youd chandler az costco wouldve stopped say hello really enjoy stuff darren
another waymo advertisement
one car lidar see way around right happens car painting everything lidar receiver get confused current lidar receiver even capable
bit overselling fact speaks different story maybe technology close ready infrastructure definitely
cant compare u world driving test joke existing road law almost impossible people learn driving properly
feel like huge oversight make video without talking public mass transit end there list problem supposedly solved unsupervised vehicle theyre solved bus
dont understand everybody invested safety freedom almost value anymore take emotion away ask beneficial earth everybody survives everything even dumbness last need people walking planet
whole video biased ad completely ignored many key point would love see channel stick nonsponsored scientific approach video
ignore
mother driven hundredtwenty year without single accident died ninenine im sixtythree u hundredtwenty plus year driving much big city aggressively zero accident insurance company every thanked u cop ever pulled u give u medal none girlfriend wife ever impressed started driving fully operational war ive got fortyseven year accident free think much insurance mother paid decade cover accident lot wonder im going get many like like despite amazing record know evil car insane specie would keep producing
welp time buy car without driver
find interesting hold machine incredibly high standard fact machine make tiniest margin error somehow unacceptable despite better human
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
clorox taste good
lmfoa
question whether people allowed drive choosing drive putting others danger
huh elon doesnt look smart waymo close producing fsd car
ha ha like need derek suddenly pause middle video talk sponsor whole video ad google
thats kind like saying web service sponsor actually ad amazon host aws waymo owned google come
lfox really got ad video even dont youtube premium subscription
well stated video sponsored google beginning video
zhangbill said waymo google owned exactly ad google
carlosdurand wouldnt surprise least still good know google project hasnt gone graveyard yet least
long never name johny cab
awesome imagine people could take train bus instead removing people road completely
dont see driverless car beneficial investing good infrastructure public transport benefit driverless car coming private sector give incentive make market however public transport benefit driverless car greener
people want car big reason public transport driverless point public transport private car people like want material wealth electrical driverless car look like green form private car ideal case would world electrical driverless car used good infrastructure green safe wont kill materialistic craving humanity
want car thats amazing stuff
want know vehicle snow heavy rain sensor covered mud dirt dead bug also dirt road deer road near road happens try take road closed gps map system use doesnt know im using fully automated vehicle want make sure safe condition personally im looking forward drive
autonomous vehicle fine dandy snow fall longer idea road snow low visibility hard even seasoned driver way ai handle atleast decade two
im far worried possibility hacking car involved accident didnt know react
bet driver tripped saw nobody seat lol
question think let say accident involving selfdriving car regular car owner regular car decided take court im asking would wrong question would suing owner selfdriving car company made selfdriving car fully selfdriving car driver passenger decision made made car reason car made decision come programming way build tested manufacturer would make sense sue owner selfdriving car manufacturer selfdriving car
psa video sponsored waymo entirely waymo thats sponsorship thats minute ad
yep failed mention series airline crash caused computer system pilot could even override right computer got lead killing people last decade
want nothing car street human problem automobile
people cant trust selfdriving car want flying car
like driving liked job railroad automated existence screw automation
video give hope driverless car fuel used fully electric efficient old fuel using camera fully controlled technology may require lot energy
say bring hate driveling would love nap
enough get road communicate wifi safe
hummmm brazilinian accent army
long ai win nascar race
really dumb boycott take someone jawb away suggest read venus project expansion brain go selfcheckout line
nobody want except moron safety fact invite technocrat restrict ability drive freely without tracked
would autonomous vehicle le able tracked
wouldnt able function without connected network without sensor tracking environment every slight adjustment vehicle impossible without intrusion privacy
plymouth require gps camera function insurance liability fall
veritasium execute beautiful ballet driving together sitting one car heart attack haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
yea thanksi think youre insane
definitely think ready full autonomous vehicle there catch need massive roll even car autonomous isnt enough autonomous car road problem driver may get distracted vehicle also human arent predictable least car autonomous could communicate eachother share sensor data suddenly youre using car sensor data youre using hundred even thousand autonomous car tracking manned car relay data another autonomous car thats joining road via intersection second car already know car even see car autonomous every autonomous car know location every manned car whole area long manned car seen autonomous car could also sensor mounted intersection especially dangerous busier intersection autonomous car bird eye view entire intersection also could basic reflector better suited autonomous car side road elon musk wrong said there future lidar would want camera autonomous car sun glare affect camera much human eye could get point car autonomous think would lot better also think autonomous car need manual drive function biggest concern always snowy region dealing ice snow unpredictable though think autonomous car handle sliding around slow ok least well people handle part simply dont see road become issue afterall life need human judgement
ok thats nice california sunny warm bring technology northern canada snowstorm freezing rain kmh wind im curious autonomous vehicle would handle circumstance compared human doubt understand whats happening completely loos traction
ab braking starter another note human driving vehicle start spin wrong thing steer opposite direction seems like correct way control spin watch stunt driver taking corner fast steer spin gain control vehicle
nineball agree ab help prevent wheel locking still traction pure ice ab usually dosent help wheel lock wheel speed sensor cant tell there lack traction mention january th saskatoon saskatchewan canada surprise freezing rain extremely high wind able blow stationary vehicle around ease semi highway literally blown lane could react driving alberta indication hit ice trailer trying pas able regain control doubt autonomous car would able technology believe use extreme climate lot work still done havent even started mention freezing sensor ice snow
hello veritasium would like point attention captain flight around hour flight time particular aircraft believed significant factor crash feel little misleading leave relevant info additional asian country almost taboo question critique someone higher position copilot may reframe pointing mistake making recommendation caused crash past unfamiliar pilot asian may relevant pilot skilled crucial safe operation flight automation also caused several plane crash despite pilot better judgment input like max think unfair selectively choose one side coin without mentioning leave people incomplete knowledge topic hand thus sway make decision might made otherwise
question fully autonomous car used road work wd purpose would honestly game changer
average consumer buy waymo
watch china make quantum computer fully function hack car make turn left
driverless car illegally
ive always thought autonomous car much safer human driver
true dangerous thing road year time anything driven person people walkingcycling im looking forward autonomous vehicle keep safe safer keep
agreed human susceptible stuff like paying attention road tired road rage machine pay attention dont get tired emotion least
based political compass
thought human dangerous world anywhere
ever used microsoft window imagine realworld blue screen death
whats even point car dont drive basically private public transport sure profession remote area always need car beyond
honestly biggest problem wont confidence driverless car ability car sickness way keep getting motion sick car im driving even sometimes get little nauseous
car already driverless retard driver would rather trust program
im huge fan veritasium love work funny youtube recommended another veritasium video published research wrong would love selfdriving car every programmer know would never get smarthome human imperfect every thing make would fully adopt autonomous car would want research done someone else instead company alone telling video sponsored company provides almost downside autonomous vehicle fact presenting moral obligation adopt soon possible cant help feel one biased video
prefer carless driver
strongly believe autonomous car one fear autonomous car hit mass market company start trying cut cost unlike plane thousand produced year car mass product million car manufactured year currently company build car heavily focus safety one accident get enough medium attention could set back technology year weve accepted technology autonomous car become standard fear company might get sloppy focus low cost safety competitive consumer market
love drive car going ged rid
crazy think number death driving fatality year around covid death per year wow
mean mediablownup number actual number
good thing implement copy safety sustainable policy netherlands death serious injury plummeted netherlands stop de kindermoord protest late
scififan bro please dont fall propaganda rabbit hole
imagine much ad cost
wouldnt serious damage employment mean million people work uber taxi would lose job unemployment really world need right
man throwing sam year ago deep cut way one
info car sickness vehicle always car sickness issue even sometimes get car sick drive
id love see would handle south america south east asian city think may lead eventual ban motorcycle majority car driverless nobody want ride autonomous motorcycle youre one hitting pedestrian rest public wont support
didnt come time scully auto landed hudson plane landed perfectly
human driver make autonomous driving scary
long stay left lane im good
yes want try canadian city get
cant wait see corporation exploiting wonder profit
private mode doesnt really work like internet browser
moral dilemma really quite useless aside interesting thought experiment imagine human situation wont stop think id better hit one helmet hit random person autonomous car hand wont probably even reach situation forced choose brake long reach choice constantly paying attention surroundings something human doesnt really isnt choice avoid hitting someone car either make choice programmed choose random whereas person usually choose hit someone randomly making autonomous car par human situation superior one
still dont trust million non standard situation algorithm would stuck knowing driver lower window yell beep car front knowing driver something wrong let honest time use car instead public transportation comfortable faster even traffic jam bus use road self driving car drive safe snail potentially speed mph highway mph without stopped would choose speed dont want spend third lifetime traffic
lot bias video clearly meant prefer autonomous driving person driving like person need k hour driving get better statistic doesnt matter couple hour human skill reach peak driving add number hour driven essentially add skill person another thing ofcourse car gon na negligent human intoxicated wreckless always sensor malfunction cause accident also long term lot driverless car might get rid lidar tech cut cost move cameraonly autopilot system like tesla per elon worse bad weather point discourage type tech large scale thing like costcutting sensor glitch might kick
maybe intuitively trust driverless car human project incompetence human driver
friend driving car automatic emergency braking plastic grocery bag blowing wind toward front car totally harmless car slammed brake could disaster going faster million little decision make instantaneously every time drive computer really capable making especially still illogical human driving car always expecting driver unexpected half time computer need taught lot people love drive expect hand key time soon also like electric car new technology expensive going take long time car work way used used market college kid wal mart worker decade self driving electric car norm
service worker guerentee google map still incomplete happens cant get take right house see place wan na stop lunch spur moment lot issue still safety issue issue
hear autonomous vehicle recognizing moon traffic light yet
honestly faster roll technology save life could likely eliminate traffic ever common occurrence
fully autonomous semi driving florida highway year
oh good thousand job gone need
carjacking
hmmm video seems familiar
there something slightly comforting able blame another human death amputation dent one blame unbridled rage goassuming unavoidable accident actually happen ever
good luck convincing speed camera revenue raking government
guy crash helmet v autonomous car issue ever driven anything faster wheel barrow know enough time choose helmet helmet probably enough time choose anything else
brilliant video
maybe elderly technology removed human being observer life many people actually like driving car already giving control sovereignty life big tech thanks
huge question missed youre involved accident driver input make life death difference respond accident example another car change lane pit maneuver vehicle
going old manual car
thing driverless car smarter alternative
everyone thats going lose job
big problem show system consumer level hacked
problem driverless car would love one work job see drive around km week id still like able drive older car weekend several older vehicle love drive wont getting everyone road lifetime sure could make thing lot safer overall think bit eliminating parking lot etc little pie sky people still want vehicle everyone even give
really exciting selfdriving vehicle work well good condition unfortunately u road mediocre condition worse roadway u outright poor condition check america infrastructure report card would need huge expensive divisive conversation infrastructure improvement talk full transition autonomous car would lot better instead focus public transit biking infrastructure pedestrian traffic etc environmentally financially socially sustainable solution problem surrounding car
im going first ever ride fully autonomous vehicle get surprised wow driver plot twist guess
stole one top comment ric sta verbatim
probably say thing first time ride one
doesnt waymo vehicle driver monitoring helping car remotely im pretty sure
wait longer drive manually
earth riding tesla
thing still like much drive
yes auto car shouldnt controlled central server
worst video far long advertisement waymo
car probably get maintenance aeroplane reality isnt like boeing max plane flew ground damaged sensor
vehicle waymo saw u
need happen people need better education driving safely consequence driving like idiot mile experience driving living including mile semi truck country wount find automated anything
really cool driverless car reduce road accident theyre solution cleaning environment misleading clean environment need car dont burn fossil fuel driving fcevs fuel cell electric vehicle running green hydrogen full electric vehicle instead petrol fossil fuel also need renewable power power vehicle need solar wind geothermal existing hydro infrastructure green power infrastructure driverless car make road safer
video driverless semitrucks would love see technology effect industry
come time car road autonomous would lidar camera able know light beam
check timing reflected light comparison reflection angled beam refraction change light spectrum laser another source ai possible way came imagination im sure google give thought solve
benedictjohannes yes easily possible seperate lidar way propose
brosbrotherslp im expert field think thats quite apparent comment perhaps enlighten actually done
benedictjohannes depends system time backround light calculated also u using laser based system opening angle reflection small highly unlikely another lidar laser even reflected right angle detected another option use variable frequency pulse way synchronized lazer emitted sensor detected light end noise still lidar best used non reflective controllable environment far better sensor mass use especially cost factored
brosbrotherslp saying several thing background light calculated spectrum lidar sensor narrow enough background light wont even picked sensor right dont know frequency band lidar operates lot light em radiation source spectrum ruling noise calculation would necessary opening angle small likely lot laser emitter would rotate fast enough get degree coverage right lidarlaser vehicle likely detected agree original comment rule belonging another vehiclecar variable pulse frequency solve problem iirc laser rotating sensor get really tough filter lower cost sensor think radar ruled wide angle wave emitter like radar make really hard distinguish signal another emitter laser lidar used precision interesting lower cost sensor used google opted use expensive technology
happens dust storm show better yet car flat passenger going change tire happens blind person get taken wrong address even better yet happens passenger medical emergencyi guess screwed self driving thing going help load luggage grocery wheel chair head year amazon drone deliveryhmmm aint seeing th largest metro area country jet packseveryone gon na flying around never happened technology say something doesnt mean
god sake give u decent public transportation
true think train bus driverless vehicle people involved
law around human driving car change coming decade necessitate massive expansion public transit poor person could afford second mortgage one car driverless bus run would awesome
seems boring also car he isnt consumer ready still year
cool tech know better massive public transportation walkable city give advantage autonomous vehicle proven technology already exists today waiting tech able deal uncertainty
living city decade autonomous metro copenhagen im used driver scenario automated car quite surprised company ride like already excists cool
need parking lot even autonomous vehicle standard still vehicle many many time need move stuff one point another plus keep lighting gear shoot car hate riding back seat vehicle self driving time would probably use long trip b getting stuck heavy traffic
need make sure automated car also tell passenger left something behind
yes elevator car thing
happens many competing lidar space light flash unique code know response laser
well human eye dont lose ability see large group dont see computer eye would
human eye dont shoot invisible laser beam
actually thought
finetalpies speak
sorbital human eye dont shoot infrared laser beam
first death caused autonomous vehical almost never went court sayin
next step driverless car allow move way parked prevent accident hoomans crashing
planning first prank autonomous vehicle siren sound phone megaphone
bingo automatic feature driverless car quickly learned hacked regular driver benefit autobraking im pulling know stop screw rider car get tossed forward external microphone watch make guy pull way pas hit siren sound external speaker car happens tailgate driverless car immediately get way would suppose sure isnt going brakecheck would used lot
published dissertation ethical dilemma selfdriving vehicle birmingham city university spoke human good adapting relinquished control went detail potential future protocol selfdriving car would use theyre used today people simply arent aware yet play crucial role life cool seeing graphic used dissertation shown video well
like someone hack make crash
holding
actually friend problem worse problem never driver road instead car see land used road parking lot often time dont get used point person easier time finding parking spot home overuse land make land extremely expensive buy leading high rent cost ultimately car ruining society creating urban sprawl unaffordable housing lastly wasnt urban sprawl advent car would job top lack pollution car replaced reasonable zoning everything within walking distance use amtrak train also would cheaper owning car car insurance brings another important matter car costly insurance gas maintenance add thousand dollar cost month leading many people far poor afford rent college overall car ruined society driverless car making worst rather better competent hacker quantum computer could mass scale hack car turn crash intersection deadlock city day
prefer driving whether would save life
olivia victoria honest im sure understand youre saying checking square traffic light youre trying tie able spot traffic light dont run definitely good comparison since box obscure whether traffic light like see traffic light pole box considered box selected mean doesnt actual light pole ambiguous
republican people know believe would prefer high chance death bad human driver rather super low chance death computer driver think thats one biggest hinderance self driving car
would argue fully autonomous car yet still geo fence
yeah lack trust one dimension think fact trajectory making ton individual carbonemitting either directly indirectly battery construction unit transportation rather say train public transportation
autonomous vehicle help problem many resource go making vehicle idle time well need make far fewer vehicle first place eliminate need actually vehicle furthermore carbon footprint personal vehicle actually quite small weird one hundred company account emission animal food industry account account another commercial transport good another wed better focusing reducing emission area reigning emission big company eating diet le animal product creating green good production near major population center reduce shipping emission keep mind autonomous vehicle mean extremely recessive bus route well probably cheaper cleaner energy efficient eliminate city trafficthus depend autonomous high volume public transit city faster transit become due le traffic furthermore switch greener energy creation first place recharging electric car also cheaper
thumbnail xd
funny thing theyve existed year
human driver hit motorcyclist one without helmet maybe give fair odds guess usually dont even choose simply take path likely avoid accident
grass
oh id love taxi would affordable would certainly use least time month situation cant drive dont want drive need make call last preparation exam read book chill fully autonomous car would total gamechanger probably many people
technology complete autonomous car drive suburb subsaharan africa metropolis
car bad car
earth pedestrian run stationary vehicle
might information missing see hard stop parking lot mean sudden closely following individual might time react therefore run car werent expecting sudden stop technically car stopped person ran regardless whether individual foot skateboard bike another car expectation car human driver act might match autonomous car operate leading weird result look one specific angle
id except inevitable outcome step driverless car become mainstream step government decides human unsafe drive car car manufacturer longer allowed produce humandrivable car step humandrivable car become illegal step government force car manufacturer provide backdoor access every car control step government leave stranded drive wall steal child school youre want think wont happen educate messed stuff cia gotten away
start whole town replace car autocars see happens
chaosif car malfunction helo boom know synchronized read sometimes late
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
benito think id rather trust engineer make car work right trust average person idiot road
self driving car need mix human driver quite long time become common way getting around people love car love independence wait even minute car arrives happy
dcostello mean buy driverless car self would expensive one stopping would waiting time driverless become extremely good drive everywhere least road dont know wanted drive onto beach example
im little suspicious sponsorship affecting video
maybe testing put realistic condition instead perfect ideal weather condition maintenence corporation public wont abide
car functioning real road dosent get realistic real
sorbital car yes ai vi accurate need camera sensor function unless mean video put normal realistic situation mention
pc phone crash requiring restart fix im travelling kph hope car instantaneous reset decide hardwaresoftware problem
thats exactly still pilot plane case point max computer glitched plunged deck shame boeing hid capability everyone
read level redundancy many critical system vehicle detect failure bring vehicle stop safely could easily see scenario av would handle steering system accelerator pedal fault far graceful manner panicked human
car already computer read position steering wheel pedal order determine output really new problem
youve ever seen well implemented server hardware youd know reliable computer get redundant power supply raided storage cluster processing unit multiple networking cable said dont care car become driverless going car need curb car dependency
dooder entire system go still make driverless car safer kill computer failure programing error simulation almost always flaw dont match reality totally trust safety data yes redundancy proved many time complex computer system level fail safer safe anyway hacking cause untold thousand drive high speed thing like day care end autonomous car almost imposable prevent especially someone spy network get involved like u government hack actually went company security loaded hack next update actual spy spy stuff company set everything auto car go away
people horrible driver dont even know many think driver problem driving fine many knowingly drive poorly fact remains vast majority human being bad driver
driverless car fine drive narrow country lane difficult driving condition hardly room pas another car think entrust safety dare say human driver
kei car exists
agree everyone large scale public transportation would best going happen united state anytime soon driverless car could amazing u kinda surprised see comment people still crazy skeptical like yes maybe still working simple matter fact would reduce road kill cause people car seriously reduce death car aint perfect dont see yall aint hyped wanted straight invest waymo unfortunately owned alphabet directly gosh imagine pay thousand dollar buy car every year excited truly believe coming hope many people invest push change faster even stop seeing much road kill
want investment railway tram public space walking bike riding dont need pave planet make every public space nightmare pedestrian car focus way form public transportation
one word snow
build train cool build train
one admit technology tested pristine condition term weather topography term auto manufacturer havent got squirrely brained finger yet driven car since memory dad driving car ive seen lot change cranky old luddite hate technology wouldnt watching video im child space race love technology ive seen enough change know always two edged sword auto industry designer love throw technology around sake without thought whether actually make thing better simple example made thing worse touch screen never allowed car there little doubt mind watching nutbars drive taking human element driving going make thing exponentially safer argument technology might succeed video focus overcoming user reticence basis safety thats issue technology fail succeed people around world see vehicle expression often want good luck overcoming century marketing programming human way make self driving car truly safe realize full benefit safety wise ban people driving non autonomous vehicle good luck here kicker many people look self driving car eliminating inefficiency driver bring road rush hour wont bad thing run smooth commute shorter result wrong waymo sure cant wait sell advertising work day might say coworker gee havent eaten burger king long time cell phone give info waymo way home youll taken burger king two youll think oh must accident usual route efficient reroute ha ha ha
school project little year ago level autonomous vehicle existence except geolocked one cool see far tech come already implication completely worldchanging
fighter recognize automatic response get trouble much faster trying reason training save bad situation logic reason ask fighter theyll say training make capable critical high stress moment thats combat sport one piece self defense puzzle complete answer still need training multiple attacker weapon situation strange human anything machine similar degree success
talk people funny dont seem like comfortable unless car infallible need better currently quick drive pretty much anywhere well least england anyway enough see bar set pretty low mistake seems people believe perfect driver wont accept anything le autonomous vehicle difficult convince people machine better though matter poor person actually something
eliminate traffic parking lot add green space big city need public transportation le need car self driving car solution issue
city kei car
say
""
fact bofa
self driving car would part public transportation instead people car would share would constantly moving like taxi without need lunch break salery would cheaper maybe
driverless train thing srsly invest research weight efficient sustainable transportation

since many many many year think lion france since
north american society banked road tear track pave road put track back
thing ive driverless metro cost driver vehicle passenger much le relevant vehicle move one person make much sense replace expensive driver first train driver probably better driver average car driver stringent health criterion better trained average car driver passed driving test decade ago want dangerous driver road first

incident parking lot car suddenly stopped main concern would everyday reality part world like western country v third world lane size u like time lane size europe including major european city sidewalk also bigger well maintained may find cm thin sidewalk parked car people constantly walking road thing thing changed cause city old building block squeezed self driving car reality soon minority world mostly city built could reach city without safe
honest job put rosaways plus hour day people vast majority bad driver see lazy selfish see seen crash happen human error instead greedy
dislike people work car insurance company

car constantly imagining someone else mean exactly like human driver wow special
lidar radar make car cost extremely expensive tesla leader fully autonomous driving would use camera vision neural network depth perception
human tried driving vision alone sometimes get fooled optical illusion
would ride completely driverless car unless utilizes several sensor different driving condition perspective
cellofellow matter time tesla car well trained neural network model would need use radar lidar car besides whenever doubt always rely eye rather sensor lidar radar technology implemented bigger scale cost machine learning model get better fed data

hey guess old blind already mean transport suited called bus train tram automating car wont solve traffic problem like adding lane dont solve either solution always public transport glorified small bus wont solve enheirent ineffeciencies car autonomous car regular car perpetuate car culture ruin walkability city even parking elimated ruin health social life promoting society destructive suburb
sure instead trusting human driver trust human programmer thousand mile away worse trust ai incentive make sure human survive anything
hello human insurance policy issued alien abduction around policy sold mainly resident u england terrance
im sorry cant justify driverless car based people driving standard instruction inadequate country get trained better git gud le people killed need driverless car
course autonomous driver safer human average however never perfect insurance issue legally settled practical

video many dislike
channel educational advertisement equivocates plane elevator road traffic number contextual variable present driving much greater even flying plane video make claim questionable best simply false plenty comment address talking disingenuous attempt educating people autonomous vehicle actuality topic much complex addressed

american invent selfdriving car upgrade public transit system
wouldnt compare experience car get riding billion mile experience human get driving way computer learns different car incident happening people think allowed others instead strictly follow rule put police officer near driver prevent car incident put police officer also near pedestrian crash take place point crash happening human cant drive well lazy time
right computer program wont take shortcut execute every instruction every time multiple time second
yeah computer dont succumb human emotional weakneses like think drive amazingly take every risk dont take shortcut either human error occur due fallacy obeying rule add top distraction like phone
zenithquasar actually dont mind self driving car wish one future key point wanted say correct compare experience car get riding b mile drive get moreover need b mile experience show badly learn think human would acquire similar experience k mile see ai still hard work easy u example remember elon musk stated able automate activity like connecting hose

really want viable city good self driving car sadly would one best city awfully designed
amazing tech im convinced argument le traffic think best way accomplish le car usage completely better city design biking walking tram train bus could utilize tech etc
looking forward le year really could far le traffic mean car would waste space traffic light would pointless would removed

concerning transition phase believe total number accident might go quickly one might think traffic consisting autonomous car certainly much safer today traffic autonomous car following rule strictly lead overtaking dangerous maneuver human driver mixed scenario could turn increase number serious accident also adding road quality point would like add weather point point autonomous car either accept higher risk crash deactivated certain point seems like dilemma however video show nicely proper condition benefit autonomous car pretty overwhelming
easy hack sabotage
living alberta see adverse road condition major barrier get snow cant see road lane person falling snow could affect lidar spelling well still cool way go yet

major employer push employee return officewhether autonomous commuting punishing employee community environment le need car first priority
someone break one camera car itll become useless else think gon na operate without knowing whats around
end youre vido essentially vindicated people saying year away sure might really good driverless car certain city like said year big city would game changing simply widespread adoption
least good condition functional thats whole point indeed
one gon na talk like taxi
autonomous car would drive intercommunicate fine currently naaah im afraid human driver

mean poor people transport thats told asked bus u
american yes imagine walk meter destination
inconvenient scary
auneakeffect inconvenient properly funded almost like set fail bare minimum make poor people able go work
emilmullerv inconvenient operate someone el schedule route
think biggest impact safety pollution would achieved focus company like one making giant network automated taxi service people could simply stop buying car altogether limitation taxi cant drive far late simply dont apply fully autonomous car
know public transit
apaledot wont take exactly want want people buy car convenience freedom provides provide freedom buying car would become rare id imagine
lake im saying driverless car dont provide benefit term pollution climate energy efficient normal car someone opts use driverless taxi instead owning car doesnt mean producing le pollution whereas bus train far efficient per person train also safer automobile ever could
apaledot ah see mean yes youre right mistakenly thought would reduce environmental footprint transportation guess really wont consume le energy using similar electric car without driveless functionality thanks explaining point
interesting tech long ad waymo zero negative aspect consideration mentioned also portrayed would simply work almost everywhere although currently limited area controlled environment
negative aspect consider
helveticacalibri idk thing like cost thing he implying everyone someday drive car fact apparently dozen people background responsible accident happens like im saying isnt future expecting bit veritasium
imagine one day car fully autonomous execute beautiful ballet driving together ummm pedestrian cyclist supposed safely cross ballet underpass every intersection get mugged overpass basically cant cross wheelchair viable solution high number crash congestion yes part solution autonomous car safer human driver le car traffic general people using much efficient mean transport like public transit cycling even implement ballet banning pedestrian cyclist humandriven car street would reduce traffic thanks induced demand adding lane congested highway people take car trip road congested travel time long people decide take trip use different mean transport
btw least mexico also get mugged overpass
think pedestrian could fit rather nicely actually crossroad heavy traffic probably controlled today could stay way pedestrian car would organize maximum efficiency pedestrian would need press button signal intention cross road like often today anyway car would create time slot actually cross road possibly even without need stop car slowing thinking traffic big city lately wonder optimal current system regarding throughput power efficiency optimal average human behavior together crossroad control system thing comparison theoretically optimal situation everything everybody would behave optimal way much room improvement could perhaps cut travel time half using le fuel time sometimes seems traffic dense even though many car going different speed unoptimal spacing enought safely cross road enough keep road busy car long time would nice car organized tight group moving like single body speeding slowing little possible create sufficient time slot crossroad car groupspedestriansetc
vladimirburian yes basically normal traffic light communicate car light change happen optimal time make sense light would also need detect number waiting pedestrian cyclist take account bit like dutch light detect tram bus change immediately public transit pas faster car wait slightly longer car communicating optimize traffic would certainly better human driver although limit close together car safely drive even communication dont want massive accident software bug applied brake tire blow one car organize many car group moving single body sound bit like train friction le peoplecargo size fuel used
start comparing driverless car elevator hmm good comparison
comparison human rider psychology fear task difficulty
flinx still bad comparisonequivalency tho risk involved car elevator compelling argument brought aeroplane
tutumazibuko even airplane comparison kinda fall apart realise plane usually fly straight line maybe hour time traffic actively avoid real challenge take land avoid manoeuvre bad weather meanwhile car navigate twist turn road congested traffic sort unpredictable behaviour driver
tutumazibuko people psychologically thought risk falling death automated elevator huge perception mattered reality
oof elevator driver strike really backfired treated properly well show important oh guess demonstrated important problem automation within current capitalistic structure exemplified lot job dont wont need anymore system take care people losing job
get paid promotion video unveritasium opinion selfdriving car clearly analogous airplane think many people draw comparison easily without thinking much thing airplane dont regulated driving environment air pilot pilot large commercial airline well trained highly skilled pilot sticking regulation time unfortunately dont driver sticking traffic rule time even mention pedestrian cyclist even animal running around autopiloting aviation complex driving car around race track selfdriving car operating real life may encounter situation analogous airplane landing without il case btw autolanding impossible
waymo car ive calcualted future better stop person maybe cross road parking slot
damn two front teeth bright bright white
good thing human job hello like drive great people disabled way even take instead oh wait taxi uber lyft guess many people job thats concern
way uber way expensive mistreats driver duis drowsy driving people driving distracted
helveticacalibri think car cheap ride happen like driving dont drink drive besides isnt uber taxi people freaking lazy want little possible dont care thinking either pretty soon wont choice technology tell u like robot
lynnmicucci great responsible driver doesnt apply everyone good driving habit dont apply everyone dangerous driver road feel would better machine driving

going put many people job may safer may cheaper like way job sent sea doubt tech create poverty
shhhhhh dazzled cool tech dont think follow belief new tech must always good u
get run driver sue may lose license drive get run driverless car happens company get fine vehicle stay road need eliminating car city drive around empty
waymo totally mapped still long way away regular car
sponsored waymo booo
next world changing tech revolution electricity internet autonomous transit
voluntarily use driverless vehicle ever many edge case forever present generalized intelligence needed driving system fundamentally lack always lack humanlevel ai available driverless vehicle opinion remain mostly intriguing novelty serving useful function maybe driving need significantly displace regular human driving year know lifetime way
think good wait till tesla release beta
least good condition technology currently functional yeah thats exactly think still ready
ready le year foreshadowing
functional human would accurate thing say
darksector probably however would take least current approach probably around decade get car working every major u city around widespread adoption sound like realistic time frame obviously ad video wasnt mentioned
would love spend time something else looking damn traffic watching netflix texting playing game sleeping ahhh yes thats way go
fully autonomous vehicle date fact digital technology allow great risk digital autonomous oxymoron spreading transhumanist propaganda expose people great danger harm economic consequence wealth destruction people understand trust technology going kill chance
google selfdriving car bet powered google drive
believe road would safer computer driven car
opinion fact youll get le asshole speeding tailgating slow distracted drunk drowsy angry stupid etc driver people shouldnt even driving long car great safety feature car also outside id rather people driving day
human driving
believe stupid completely ignorant computer actually work
klebsartstudios ok
vyzr really take onto road inch snow let see long last ever wonder test car arizona ever wonder dont hear new info news wonderful driverless car touting verge never drive ai take world year nowall way back invention transistorhasnt happened yet wouldnt hold breathunless one car misinterprets cat turn end lake
friend extremely distrustful idea selfdriving car one specific reason machine hacked people cant phone computer get infected used people time arent several ton metal capable running someone safety precaution put place keep car used like remote control weapon
think standard vehicle install sensor technology provide alert automatic accident avoidance maneuver choice human driver decide want drive vehicle let ai take control ai ability take control detects reckless driving bad driving behavior also car company need sell extra safety feature like extra addons included standard package like airbag seatbelt furthermore driving ai completely isolated software system operate grid protect cyber attack
car hostile situation example robber weapon come front car normally person would reverse run
car automatic gun hidden behind headlight itll detect robber analysing data million robbery open fire calling police driving fck
hope even car focused future promote biking example
like self driving car love privacy enjoy driving general im excited im self driving car company track exactly going navigation system start forcibly play ad car make consumer pay ad free car lol also live mountainous area poorly marked road corner narrow sharp mirror required see oncoming car maybe safe time think great taxi though definitely get behind usage big city let speed empty road
trust car drive safely driver private company trying turn profit make public transit im also single rider kind wasteful put tech bus
car drive take away ability drive like said made road car didnt stop sign people would forced give driving saying
welcome tempe
driverless car make nervous represent certain amount progress toward real possibility eventuality people way much control go car paid money taking away driver remove lot freedom said driver responsibility necessary use freedom wisely freedom pose risk sure gun circular saw tool
made comment much radar lidar used tesla eliminating completely much noise processor ai better calculating distance camera alone
would love able use daily autonomous vehicle thats beautiful try convince u advertisement yes statistically car nothing time something majority rush hour arent familiar dont yes see fact giving offensive offensive lying consciously omit uncomfortable fact people go work home work home car cant give quantity comfort would obliged use autonomous car sharing especially case epidemic want need car used see vision self driving car shortsighted
happens police officer try pull driverless car police officer need resort ramming
vehicle waymo experience
forget safety huge course think happens longer drive internal lay car change could probably live one alone would change thing imagine nomad staying anywhere really worse freedom travel live cincinnati want go nyc weekend day thats hassle plan problem get car friday night sleep way saturday morning youre stay car sleep might need rentable secure garage scheme thats cheaper hotel car would free people experience place theyve never time visit see relative etc thats top head
im guessing waymo google competent engineer gone every google product disaster right im glad fully autonomous car finally want everywhere
cool get car like driving biggest concern liable accident
liable elevator accident passenger owner defective elevator
cloudpoint think there significant difference machine single range motion external factor account machine making decision based constant data input
enfynet machine certainly different legal principle machine operate regardless number input go decision punish machine error youd surprised many input go selfdriving elevator modern skyscraper need aware externality rapidly changing data selfdriving car stop working sits annoying vehicle selfdriving elevator stop working plummet great height
cloudpoint driverless car cause accident liability software hardware owner
enfynet already answered liability belongs owner software hardware liability owner accident victim going chase party owner show factory defect exists owner chase manufacturer recover loss ownership likely includes use risk clause expected negative outcome like owning anything else used condition owner chooses including car driver driver vehicle insured driver expected regular driver affect risk assigned vehicle there insurance driver per se
stuff driverless car come note work well perfect condition like deal coming dirt road onto country road there low vision know someone life extreme example live corner middle forest direct access country road turn anything producing noise engine also need crank window listen sound car went road busy fast enough theyd get tboned far tell driverless car would get killed situation wouldnt able see car late also experience thought guy clearly looking straight forward cross road hit break hard could part comparison trash human look social queue situation like adapt speed learn efficiently thank computer computer may accumulate lot practice time also need extra time need try everything even dumb thing order learn also give little comfort car stationary hit lack context let say youre bike travel quickly hill car approaching suddenly make turn front quickly stopping arent able slow time hit car end er technically irrelevant positioning obstacle hit car car stationary hit shame
worked waymo uber self driving program much much safer people driving question
love technology totally favor thing one problem answer robot better u almost everything disciplined distracted patient etc robot task world role

look cool butjust visit india car confused run processing power
think interesting quickly getting point support population fresh drinking water food still driving technology forward prolong individual lifespan however discussing responsibility limit offspring try curb rapidly expanding population
already
driving used person job vonnegut wrote book subject robot taking job away human many driving job u alone would people without work suppose would adjust would adjustment look like technology ready dont think people ready give income robot
unfortunately wont people decision company employ
truth car programed human human imperfect thus nothing absolutely perfect
anyone going tell guy ai model work

tomfmfh mean pretty much happens rare event plane crashing due software malfunction general population still trust
theyre long way away readily available average consumer way expensive right
make think well done lety
good video bad driver
trust joy love drive drive assist would nice much automation
would like see narrow european city street country road
literally saw video showed cgp grey theory wrong overpass underpass troublesome people could get robbed especially night overall increasing capacity road allowing many car drive much dense useful adding lane highway know doesnt work im onboard self driving car fact road become safer dense car denser driving car denser pollution city well
either driverless car dont need driver seat u use system assist human driver
didnt know elevator fact thanks people really need sort strike condition get used
here problem driver seat ever power steering pump go middle long drive ab ever fuse blow computer die ive encountered fairly new vehicle cant argue computer probably better driver year experience driving stock carsbut think order safest human able take control event equipment failure also think remove manual control erode away fun thing life name safety human come new way put even dangerwere clever come finding new innovative idea putting harm way
awful idea never mind autonomous vehicle really struggle recognize many type obstacle hazard many type condition theyre also awful climate massively increase vehiclekilometers travelled reform traffic law build safer street instead
think video really suffered sponsored waymo spent last century destroying city accommodate motor vehicle av likely lead renewed wave pushing anyone car even margin absence serious regulatory framework one expect country like u adopt
police want technology take make million traffic violation every year
driver license obsolete future
probably
vehicle waymo experience human driver
lmao yes
pun
underrated comment
haha waymo using promotion
clutch made much needed comment thank
min two word boing max
driving super easy computer surprise hard
thank sir mam please write derek remind human would still inhabit planet year least hope would
mi p end close coming situation unscathed havent seen car tested limit lm trusting human driver
benito wont trust car make stupid decision driving similarly human put disastrous situation even get matter way spin thousand hour experience anyone road ive driving around year last long town full drunk college people think theyre pretty alright
well good thing ai self learning adapt every surprise point possibility programmed wont issue also every waymo car drive learns new thing teach waymo car immediately adapt time
think tech cool dont ever see point every car autonomous like mentioned country barely infrastructure normal car long isnt global adoption going difficult people give independence culture come car specifically larger car community people total control vehicle
gloss requirement perfect clearly visible lane marking construction zone etc road good luck lot america truck lane warning camera constantly go exitson ramp merges even though im lane also right side radar warn traffic change lane side go im moving left lane middle vehicle right lane le capable system obviously needed test car le ideal situation get use
using lidar sensor much advanced sensor truck
autonomouselectric vehicle sound great definite application think apprehension cheaper cost could implement way better infrastructure development ebikes much better road safety environment
let future
model think lety right apprehensive letting drive first time le minute comfortable time realized better driver staying lane marinating distance behind car front course tesla still get level waymos vehicle still far better driving u im ready driverless vehicle
whats fuel economy difference
electric car gas
selfdriving car could really way improve accessabilty many people said video however wouldnt optimistic talking comuteless life solving traffic problem tempting already solution mass transit autonomous car electric car still car still take lot space mostly individual form transportation wont solve traffic
made perfect argument semi autonomous car driving becomes easy safe like people drive le safely
fully agree semiautpnomous driving make sense pay attention traffic might well driving benefit autonomous driving come dont pay attention something else instead semiautpnomous sound really dangerous human get bored easily notice driving boring straight motorway get sleepy much easily driving winding country road city take away even thing keep car following lane motorway still expect keep paying attention traffic road disaster
driverless vehicle yet end say next five year big city flipped switch everyone everywhere could make switch instantly would one thing going happen transition going issue think ten year prediction poll pretty spot
think many people would lose job driverless car took dont think going happen soon
oh yes delicious
rippin tho
think youre making faulty assumption computer arent good bad thing condition difficult u like time cant see time need remember isnt whats hard computer want compare two compare human bad computer bad computer navigate trough fog put man runway hit dead
well thought one would prefer sleep condition make le ideal drive let alone trouble trying get license second would kind kill insurance industry road vehicle
never give right drive car freedom higher value safety right steer car essential right bear arm
service engine light come even nothing wrong engine computer make mistake

video really sound like add
gl driving snowy road
johnny cab already hope controlled viki
like cgpgray said year ago human need apply video self driving car dont need perfect need better u already
thing really worry surveillance aspect fact overlord wont let travel anywhere would want simply trade effort freedom thats really le accident sale pitch population control outcome
scififan hey actually sound like great idea would lot easier enforce travel ban pandemic government could force car take far away home yes whole idea behind self driving car people stupid need kind control simply cant trusted drive drunk drive distracted tired high mistake accelerator brake slam building slam car crowd protester disagree sound great
really need autonomous manager wont sacrifice safety profit
ad pretty convincing
wonder future vehicle driverless possible think hurdle challenge come across mind example think involves public transportation like convincing government general public keeping vehicle clean incompetent people mess recklesscareless human driver security vehicle etc install camera inside vehicle would run issue privacy im really looking forward technology im worried general public government willingness
excited also filled enormous anxiety isnt great way im uber driver im scared entrenched capitalistic consumerist society there onus average person work productive justify existence dont reliably thrown denied comfort like good food shelter land everything owned cant go build somewhere new come wonderful technology undoubtedly save life improve many time eliminating need cab driver delivery people semitruck driver train conductor pilot human conducted anything seems like way technology squeezing life traditional employment idea higher employment let face limited difficult access isnt priority ensure everyone job economy keep rolling consumerist capitalistic society demand everyone job starve wonderful tech feel like really big new shiny fun comfortable messenger death even say hooray
driverless car like vaccination none vaccinated individual normal car
there one thing keep mind benefit big car manufacturer considering future may doesnt need parking lot owning car also considering revenue selling private owner owning car many time come social status behind big industry based consumption view good u bad think theyll support full automation
im driverless car ability reduce road fatality increase economic efficiency way reduce traffic bring green space back city suggest car could ever achieve myopic misleading imo there already century old technology offer benefit actually reducing traffic eliminating need parking lot move people also move much quickly car ever could course im talking train train infrastructure failing country could building network highspeed rail instead sinking deeper car culture gave u problem first place
thing cant train going everywhere sure use bike walk le convenient car
course certain thing would absolutely complimented autonomous car live countryside there way expect actually get rail line even bus come along system autonomous vehicle would ideal take care edge case like plus there factor transporting luggage cant well train
variety reason usa mostly cant build rail cheaply stupid infuriating thats situation doesnt seem likely change however new bus route city still made cheap per passenger similar rubber wheeled vehicle using existing road carrying people per vehicle average car
get train stop front door bring place need im believe shared form car would work better car service self driving car could great way get train system work force people take make driving annoying like building car zone zone onoy green car enter make parking impossible make gasoline expensive actually still everybody want car
dont agree disagree important remember many obstacle exist innovative idea autonomous vehicle speak reducing congestion imagine talking extremely large amount congestion caused human driver imagine long line human driver taking stop caterpillar along accelerate rate compared long line autonomous vehicle accelerate rate without risk collision begin think solo ride ride share could reduce congestion people willing share ride would mean anywhere regular sedan le vehicle road infrastructure road exist cost developing software building vehicle would pale comparison conceivable large scale mass transit rail system make technology accessible people corporation government happy status quo make wealthy parking imagine book vehicle certain time day call one within minute take wherever youre going vehicle significantly uptime personal vehicle mentioned downtime video personally owned vehicle average doesnt need many vehicle road service population people would obviously peak transit time vehicle arent use need standby somewhere ideal situation talk think refers road vehicle predominantly autonomous could mean drastic reduction requirement parking space service available live would use think implication benefit far outweigh negative even bandaid something much innovative replaces future doesnt mean waste served purpose
fail touch even possibility risk potential mitigation massive system hack start kind feel like giant advertisement
said video sponsored waymo company owns car he driving admitted minute advertisement start video

data safety derek analogy story plane elevator arent going cut situation current road fatality human driver per million mile driven million mile driven waymo public road peanut order magnitude fewer would needed prove superior safety
data safety derek literally state video comment hadnt watched already seen evident safer drive autonomous car average driver time spot case even lot data next couple year lot data seems optimistic order magnitude fewer would needed prove superior safety even correct debatable talking huge amount data statistically relevant mil mile peanut matter hard want look way keep mind one company data continuing prove safer human driving every day company data research literally research leaning towards superior safety human driving current road fatality human driver per million mile driven maybe accident fatal significantly rarer autonomous vehicle hasnt single fatality among autonomous vehicle well see develops seems much harder ai cause fatal accident
thepathofdawn already seen evident safer drive autonomous car average driver watch whole video comment read didnt say wasnt claimed said data prove
thepathofdawn read balanced article question whether self driving car safer human gradient google youtube doesnt allow post link dereks video even try tackle question asserts self evident video ad education even infotainment ad waymo
would love see handle swedish winter would good test
nonsense want people stop driving like asshole right held better standard
people would drive lot better fine penalty poor driving went straight fuel pump
time might coming sooner think australia locked people death definition letting perfect get way good im selfdriving car widely deployed think government risk averse happen anytime soon
really living matrix right long becomes terminator entire fleet machine billion hour experience pooled together done car done weaponized robot imagine real life aimbot constantly get better experience share experience thousand homies also aimbot even nightfall stop lidar combined human fascination plunder well development ai paint bleak picture
think significant advantage nobody talking car sharing prospective car standing still time thats sure like using bus personal bus number significantly higher parking hub time get car low well transport problem truck going replaced
veritasium waymo sponsored video welcome modern whring
phx az come thruuu
yeah self driving car amazing great better driver human probably still override though quite enjoy driving maybe make penalty accident happen manually driving harsher something dunno still want option actually drive lmao lot pilot even though vfr landing might safer many pilot still choose land manually well fun
preface saying fully autonomous car absolutely future level autonomy still long way issue video draw currently invalid parallel aircraft autonomy automated aircraft landing much simpler task navigating icysnowy road traffic controlled tower position elevation orientation runway known unchanging reason waymo pilot program phoenix determining navigate vehicle adverse weather condition proving difficult problem solve radar lidar computer vision different edge case difficult account video make sound level autonomy already nowhere close
amazing term consumption whats difference classic car mean electronics board much energy us
dont like idea autonomous car believe driving common sense game many people lacking people going ruin opinion know people going think everyone autonomous vehicle problem solved problem dont think financially viable move city people around thing
cant wait publicly traded company earlier better
could someone hack one vehicle
great work derrick
great video talking self driving car mentioning tesla seem wrong
im wondering fully automated car even know passenger car ok move even door closed passenger inside car give voice command go could car trust passenger command misunderstood voice command example passenger talking someone else phone accidentally pressed go button passenger kid want run away parent bank robber trying escape crime scene human taxi driver would able make judgement call based many detail facial expression passenger age etc doubt fully automated car make call tech company focusing road condition agree complicated time often condition thats driving complicated bet fully automated car rely human remote controller give car start trip signal would say let figure little detail first
technology back first autonomous drone landed mar
le like accident driving manual transmission car seems like likelihood distraction would lower due available hand mess phone radio often automatic
nitpicking year experience driving mean year understandingor machine equivalent could compare rate experience per understanding unit human understands something rate x time machine year human experience would equal year machine experience said improve machine x use experience database would immediately exit factory equivalent year human experience
going interesting see sort car design possible without thing like steering column brake line cabin rear facing front seat anyone
false assumption even system fed data year different human reaction experience skill thus decided system run comparison standard human ahs identified much le killedinjured people accident better fine argument experience simply false core experience may advantageuous may result le accident grand pa way road hour given age bad eye sight everyhing else fairly assumed higher accident rate therefore pure statistic need decide statistic corrected properly eg autonomuous car make way le accident driving parking los immediate believe make kill night bad weather heavy rain taken account according end strongly beleive machine win brink reached know likle look statistic
like happened cruise highway minority report concern would technological error possibility tyrannical override said vehicle
literally every piece networked technology existence could said posse vulnerability solution problem distrust technology participate democratic process vote fascist authoritarian corporate apologist
nethershaw answer simple voting transparency freedom anyone actually study corporate corruption government overreach america understand
someeguyy isnt simple youre right start
brand
best driverless car rail
please improved accessible public transport system
convincing using number derek let give unfounded answer feel like paid ad
paid ad
soon driving manually outlawed
really good automatic car take many job people throughout world making big chunk unemployed people government make sure increase employment opportunity lot field next five year employment well self driving car accomplished
cool
take issue le safe le safe nondistracted driver specific situation well absolutely however entirety overall le safe human would venture say would say comment clear could scare people reassure
people dumb robot smart
ah quantum mechanical right
yall sold hard
take amount time car ready city well maintained road cant start imagine long itll take car ready handle everyday neglected always construction road
think driverless car good people always option drive never take freedom granted driving artform people love keep tradition alive
imagine go place
people excited driverless car train literally whole time
dumbest thing ive ever read american city dont subwaystrain line especially burbs
let go list lower fatality lower accident rate lower cost per rider reduces traffic reduces parking let forget train better driverless car better energy efficiency faster transport move people longer range
jadakiss precisely focusing expanding private use individual vehicle instead prioritizing network high speed rail like every advanced country world strategizing better built community space city deter people driving dont absolutely need selfdriving car needlessly complex require entirely new set infrastructure mention obvious security concern vehicle roaming street builtin camera microphone conveniently delivered biggest tech company dont call dumb dont give nuisance understand im aware city dont subway system u pushing public transportation effectively meet need every city individual basis
mawpow mean nuance nuisance fact think driverless technology thing blocking highspeed rail expansion baffling supported modern society called dumb original comment reading still sound dumb said train always clearly true u would take year serious investment public transport statement would ring true u thats stupid complete lie
youre wrong reducing traffic part theyre cheap accessible theyll get use thing reduce traffic reliably mass transit otherwise eliminating car trip
reducing traffic congestion done transport good done autonomously night personal transport get room rush hour
yes autonomousmass transit way go
mean autonomous driving help part reason traffic really bad dont obey law perfectly speeding cutting people running red light thing impact traffic although still believe mass transportation key autonomous driving help little
omarlinp think good last mile trip definitely wont help traffic overall
traffic actually mostly human error look phantom jam
accident human error knowing properly drive lack paying attention ill soon possible
state tesla next
want better public transit city planner many issue city automated car dont fix one would economic resilience well amount resource used make car
""
wow instead starting getting older brain geting distracted like litle kid make thees selfdriving car become worse bad think schould start thinking distracted car fix litle kritik car realy cool tecnology also want ad would like dont drive enymore thees car take think perfect city time many car queue bit sity better human still behind steering wheel
maria sweety hotgirl vlogs theoretycal example ye pedestrian cross xd youll need add trafic light sort made thees car
happens bunch human driver try hit driverless car everywhere detrtmined hurt human passenger inside would autonomous car protect human attacker
fear germany politics really slow progress go bit overboard regulation also switch would mean lot le car lot le car replaced damage industry way much power prevent slow change would cut back sale
want see fleet fullyautomated selfdriving car rideshares available call eliminate parking space effectively adding two lane every single street avenue
feel solution driverless car promise offer would better solved public transit like road frequently capacity orchestrating traffic like ballet could speed might better train go major destination alongside road fewer potential point failure much efficient transport ton move people course driverless car could still solution last mile something like bicycle isnt option
public transit serf role cant match sheer utility road getting need go fully automated road could carry dozen time traffic current road imagine car driving mph bumper bumper could go faster ten time traffic crash
demiserofd going car driving mph bumper bumper get train le space energy efficient le land use wont one software glitch away causing massive pileup
brandonking train error cause pileup time time actually flipside train go one destination car go everywhere
demiserofd yes train error happen theyre le frequent le train needed carry amount people restraint train track make operation much simpler inspect train track properly dont run fast tight corner nothing happen car go anywhere train cant north america weve enslaved car infrastructure neglecting public transit transit line running everywhere frequently mile public road would much convenient use train bus car
demiserofd want get train doesnt specifically go like house canwalk
autonomous car snatch away job many helpless driver maybe one day autonomous veritasium talk
autonomous audience le
see puppy grow head look pretty much got month month mean concentrate really hard maybe accept changed people seem see bigger dont notice change used time never notice change small subtle perception adapts literally every second
exploit
ive seen knight riderexept episode kitt get hackedthe system worked well
think human better driver dont believe car solution train tram bus far efficient take far le space ironically enough leave space pedestrian bikers one bus ship people single day thats fewer car road put track make electric got tram slam one cat autonomy ai make driverless youll get far better throughput autonomous car could provide better environment better people objectively superior every single way done right
would say think implemented everywhere within next year india exists
avoidance ethical question kinda blurred like saying well shouldnt discus safety pesticide hunger real enemy ramp production food reduction cost obvious ethical answer secure access resource every pesticide shall allowed duh unthinkable thing say rhetorical acrobatics give really compelling argument avoiding discussing major point together im disappointed come
id liked discussion tech evolving deal challenging environment adverse weather intense dynamic traffic condition primary obstacle
doubt walk dog time day weather time cross street eyetoeye handshake driver would give dime life autonomous car undriver coldbloodily kill dog
car would able tell youre walking dog stop
aetheriox dream eys reality problem humanmachine interaction context autonomous driving solved many expert believe theortically unsolveable foreseeable future
mikets car video stopped thought person trolley might cross road im sure shitty chihuahua wont shut night wont hit either
new mercedes eq option drive level auto pilot allowed use mobile watch netflix car driving mercedes take full responsibility anything would go wrong
think neat moving away car base infrastructure towards better public transportation cycling walking option make sense sustainability wise
comment reduce traffic dont need better car need le need car
need driveless cycling system
erikuden ok implying self driving cab taxi le demand personal car convenient cheaper use self driving cab therefore le car traffic
darksector think said move away car based infrastructure
think driverless car cool forced everyone anyone say safer course safer im arguing im arguing personal freedom concerned everyone safe possible wed locked padded cell personal freedom come risk thats something accept like car want responsibility come treading past line scientist science legislate every subject hard number accept human driver make mistake mean funneled utopia view
technology amazing going great blessing civilization scare impact transportation industry million people dont job anymore generation fix however first generation terrible consequence
could robust public transportation literally decade ago unfortunately big oil mv lobby opposed form public transportation highspeed rail big tech wasnt substantial lobbying power would half century behind europe instead couple decade term charging station public transport option
public transportation u isnt feasible spread europe significantly dense
jeanlucthumm literally made sense spread make even sense build train metro
please take example japan instead europe least get train time
emilmullerv really explain public transportation mostly found city country side think reason realize u doesnt good public transport either
jeanlucthumm actually opposite u city arent dense enough carcentric way around
driverless car go exactly speed limit see causing increased congestionroad rage people stuck behind
would want know driverless car avoid pothole sharp object would puncture tyre certainly problem uk
ride progress rip lol
disappointed used airplane fallacy even topped elevator airplane super easy fly computer even human flying airplane easier driving car people generally le experience flying think hard car safety distance kilometer road would completely devoid traffic pedestrian would flagged radio beacon selfdriving car would problem either computer human good different thing eg keeping speed exaclty quite hard human super easy computer recognising object exactly way round
though fascinating vision think wont need different car car long run car selfdriving cause great harm environment climate something avoid order protect future
need selfrefuling car
lidar low re susceptible inclusion technically worse vision
well clearly consistently see meter car
everything described still relies individualvehicleperpassenger model still far inefficient oldfashioned bus course train dont count park green space time soon compare four bus passenger versus car passenger enough following distance minimally safe option mean traffic congestion option mean ton traffic even following distance approach zero ai selfdriving car decrease cost increase capability mean people want use see also jevons paradox utopian fantasy
cant wait think cant come soon enough
enjoy driving would rather another part existence automated
join u adventurous explorer galaxy far far away exciting quest free cooky
possible vulnerability hacking whatnot anytime put computer something bring computer problem
remember arent standard computer see learn one car get hacked cause collision car around avoid
aetheriox work autonomous vehicle drive using learned model otherwise would slow computer run different specialized computer sure wireless capability satellite internet radio also possible remotely hack car even right car learned avoid protect hacked fed incorrect information act
dynmads well yes likely car certain people would get hacked assassination ever get hacked allthere many easier way kill people hacking automatic car computer system possibility happening chance given vehicle targeted crashed reason already slim know autonomous car drive using learned model ai afterall fact people inherently look negative try outweigh massive benefit automatic car used environment sad best
aetheriox question deter autonomous vehicle bring forth legitimate problem yet hear someone address considering previous response im sure know much topic programmer trust software much
dynmads know going problem always actual risk given car hacked used negative way going low kick many major country large amount people standby checking problem making sure everything okay dont assume one monitoring car journey progress need back case car compromised im saying trust software im saying problem hacking low either way us hacked automatic car low due excessive monitoring people actually car
cool video definitely extended advertisement waymo ill still want drive car im locked restriction protocol autonomous vehicle
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
yes car probably never go speed limit subject restriction protocol road time police car present horror doomed specie large percentage u cant get destination second sooner argument really dont want autonomous car want able break law
car terrible general take much space parking could home bring housing price really noisy causing headache big road awful one want live close eat outside close one etc become city desert time dont anything parked similar nuclear plant take lot resource build destroy hard automate unlike rail cant go using car anyway cant drive youre drunk long distance km flying better distance km walking cycling better distance km high speed rail better distance km public transport better endless money pit due insurance repair car really good niche situation remote location maintaining road money pit city buying food week get delivered like dollar van also delivers rest neighborhood city bad planning shop km away getting public transportation hard

car wouldnt survive minute indian road
one learned indian road patter would survive long
say get rid car park implies think people wouldnt car personal automated car
theyd probably make cant buy car
didnt want video know self driving car company mean get rid car park instead letting car drive autonomously around road forever stupid seeing complete waste energy contributes greater roadwear increasing maintenance cost hey
illasra price must pay safer travel lively looking surroundings waste energy life saved watch video reply
aetheriox know else life could saved banning car city altogether instead relying public transit walking cycling would lead much aesthetically pleasing city anyway opinion least
illasra cant really ban vehicle literally used billion people would car go see point wouldnt work
pretty cool tech think example pretty poor choice first elevator like said one dimensional movement thus much easier automate yet elevator follow one dedicated path crossing weather also error elevator stop stand without problem plane much complicated course crossing majority flight army technical staff maintenance time think self driving car much complicated job even plane auto pilot also even perfect self driving solution come market affordable manner would want since want type car anywhere city public transport bike way sustainable future
people think driverless car year away never ridden one tesla year old still amazing
another great video derek cant wait come la may go az ride related anytime want collab world craziest toy designer call torrance
cool drive work car go work ride share pick go home
phone cant get cell signal despite le mile away cell towerwhen computer freeze autoupdate driver incompatible window oswhen network fails connect internet despite autoconnect box checkedi lot confidence selfdriving car wont suddenly glitch decide drive bridge
much software getting worse worse selfdriving car wont immune
corporate driverless vehicle create whole new arm organized crime industry
privacy invasion
year illegal drive car le safe self driving car xd driving licence issued human
driveless police chase
thepizzabrothersgaming listen google need milk every last cent
autonomous driving technology cool know would help society better public transportation
car wear empty seat seatbelt cant trust carbon based lifeforms
youve moved closer car
thing keep shouting personal human element ifwhen autonomous vehicle weve standardized human thought air flight development decade id ok getting autonomous uber driver seat self preservation human element whats important video worst thing shield anything perspective youre screaming one
im also trilled see adoption autonomous car greatest concern would action might hack car sensor like scenario siren anyone turn siren regardless real emergency car would pull way tamper car sensor external input would get damaged blocked follow would awesome
video paid commercial
thats sponsorship yes
aetheriox sponsorship someone pay whatever video youre making paid advertisement like commercial someone pay promote product
ken well yes doesnt inherently mean bad product yes thing like raid shadow legend ruin reputation sponsorship majority sponsorship good product behind one good product early development future work anywhere time
there aspect dont see addressing government control imagine future government decree whatever reason everyone need confined home perhaps decided certain people leave home issue command driverless vehicle effect think government would never tech company wouldnt stand think
jot one thing happens internet itll happen reality lifetime truck driver bunch electronic nanny installed truck one thing ive learned stuff constantly fails miss read situation truck gone full emergency braking panic mode metal bridge highway stuff glitchy af work perfect scenario dont care advanced technology theyre trying sell supposedly people die
stuff personally car like video said billion simulated mile travelled would take human year get total experience car driven real mile clearly work otherwise waymo wouldnt car road yet
billion simulated mile real mile mean drive living guess dont know im talking know corporation put safety front profit im sure theyre putting ready way realize video sponsored company video right propaganda
mjw first propaganda prpand noun information especially biased misleading nature used promote political cause point view charged distributing enemy propaganda second simulated mile important car actual mile driven also mention would need drive thousand year get much road experience car also road plus billion simulated mile mean car know drive drive thousand year within day tell youre better ai who sole purpose getting ungrateful as destination
aetheriox startup company misleading investor turn around make bunch promise cant keep disappear sunset cue nicola electric truck amazingly shortage idiot eating stuff furthermore startup claimed selfdriving truck coming year ago still waiting apparently found dictionary thing corporate propaganda video perfectly fit bill enjoy growing old waiting selfdriving car thatll lucky take five block road perfect weather outside perfect road condition people like delusional brain washed furthermore stupid realize
mjw corporate propaganda normal propaganda corporation definition still fit also people misestimate time span happens time also stage time mean within year car able handle snow rain like airplane land automatically fog thick pilot cant see perfected year ago time tell right situation since technological singularity approach fast money mouth money better
main problem people act like self driving car reliable dont actually dont good must le accident human average low bar
anxiety problem yes yes oh god yeeeeeesss want iiiiiiiiit
still would never ride unmanned autonomous car im car autonomous id willing use tech call car id even willing let drive take time feel need maybe grew urbanite public transport might trust automated car since already wouldnt trust taxi especially wouldnt get back seat robot car
driver outta job
perfect nap time would think would also eliminate drunk driving
underestimate madds determination punish many drinker possible
sponsored google spout propoganda whole video shocked pikachu
propaganda prpand noun information especially biased misleading nature used promote political cause point view charged distributing enemy propaganda
aetheriox spreading idea information rumor purpose helping injuring institution cause person
problem really every place planet argentina use pre covid death year traffic incident man going miss driving thing taking tha road concetrate right im convinced car take well bored like crazy happens
guy insisted taking stair maybe still alive year later
foot shorter due erosion
heard died escalator
could died sooner heart attack physical stress probably lived year
skzk dude going stair action completely destroys body like minute cardio
emilmullerv know like climb stair live th floor take le min shape lot problematic like running dangerous
autonomous vehicle great really hope arent seen substitute robust efficient public transport option like train trolley car bus future american city need competent efficient mass public transport like many country already fleet self driving car every street isnt gon na solve crisis
video frame autonomous car saving grace eliminate issue traffic safety road fact already developed technology exactly year ago car arent going anywhere society anytime soon obviously autonomous car huge improvement solution mass public transport trainstramsbuses maybe even autonomous bus
everyone kid self driving car cool wan na live future everyone self driving car dangerous id rather subject human flaw trying read people mind trying decide want lunch
yet people get road rage
yes people go driverless people terrible driver pay attention speed limit pay attention surroundings dont drive aggressively actually give damn law human capable dealing problem driverless car driverless car still designed built human robot built human screw driving youre blame car kill someone fault cant wait everybody world forgets drive car cme kill everybodys fancy car still drive old pickup truck fine ill year old one human road
still problem occur person attentive tiredness something sudden happening around also autonomous car kill someone company made car would blame
nothing happy corporation government would control move
problem waymo know others giving bad name google longer interest big bet close waymo eventually vision google
knew already existed cool ill still wait least another year getting one there always hidden bug problem show later point everyone thought thing set im also concerned happen first virus targeting self driving car launched
rfil true many country might already safer live germany there least standard come driver road oh people eventually drive playing video game road rage actually increase probably p
fun fact dont travel internationally philippine life compared united state america like traveling parallel reality feel like combined u many area way people see world respond socially many thing relation video place find elevator philippine elevator operator dont know sure filipino know either ask people looked said something really strange hadnt thought
video go handinhand cgps human need apply basically spell bigger issue come grip economic revolution people going employable machine drastically lower price great efficiency supposed make living speak arent getting paid work idea issue going need tackle sooner later going million potentially billion people going hurting dying reason dont know trade loaf bread
work wellmaintained road without inclement weather there reason test there snow rural area thats year away truly driverless car
theyre make sure work first place soon enough car able read weather condition snow like used everywhere
aetheriox agreed step idea ready autonomous vehicle today isnt true driving highway co snowstorm wouldnt work autonomous vehicle time well need driver assisted vehicle best
moralsofthestories ready driverless car area dont get unusual weather pattern agree area need driver assisted vehicle step right direction fully automatic car every reigon earth minus ocean
old people people history impairing disorder child use car ever stop public driving im gon na lose driving one fun thing
im personally love driving
problem addressed driverless car better addressed train bus dont need lane roadsparking lot everywhere
bus unreliable normal car infact theyre moreso theyre larger lead severe collision train see point bus worse car
aetheriox physical footprint bus v number car passenger individually take drastically reduce amount metal moving around road reducing chance collision id also reckon professionally trained driver road much safer regular people x number self driving done car done bus arguably le problem fleet physically changed fit certain criterion would simplify self driving problem make quicker implementation ideally robust rail system bus weve built many road bus better transition efficient mass transit system building electric car
imagine car linked
predict traffic city people switch public transport already happening cheap taxi service like uber car autonomous dont scale well public transport cycling ridesharing could help degree
concern isnt driverless car driving well im sure drive better human especially time concern hacked malicious hacking drive car instead bad stuff
youre known enough targeted hacker take car happened someone else car react drive around collision
driverless car never successful rider man autonomous car much better human driver car ya heck need human ramp pedestrian eliminate human end getting rejected
happen guy car dont learn told thing like theyre school learn experience either real road simulated happen rider say car wont acknowledge stop hit pedestrian learned
cool technology im looking forward seeing similar car replacing currently road cyclist would feel much safer next vehicle software developer dont trust software much know easy miss bug hard keep product relevant real world im talking scenario run server train ai obviously good im sure dont cover road situation maybe maybe even one thousand situation pick wrong way solve puzzle like car hitting van video would make road safer yes would bring new issue road also yes dont trust software much fails u time one also believe ai future transportation yes adoption could brutal urbanist environmentalist think car disaster driverless climate change air quality decrease result huge amount vehicle use along factor course car take lot space create noise pollution ineffective transporting big amount people expensive shape city unpleasant dangerous way etc still need transportation answer public transit micromobility actually benefit software kind mentioned video
cant wait self driving leg
thats back driveway parking slot got ta use head
would love thing dad cant drive anymore fight result really feel like lost lot autonomy self driving car would allow autonomy back unsafe road
get road
agree want see car perform big city driver lot unpredictable also place road well taken care like idea agree thats way forward car need placed environment see work
question would perform winter slippery road since saw vid slammed break person wouldnt bad
dont know car havent trained yet future im sure work fine different condition
breaking news driver crashed simultaneously cause blamed glitch software
see benefit safety improvement issue rely something job used losing skill may think clever smart car smart phone forth losing traffic long factor time management deteriorate car know route lose navigation vehicle slow allow pedestrian cross road happen vehicle awareness crossing road isnt vague theory provable problem put soft padding floor wall house child wont hurt fall wont learn catch hand falling bad home bad hard cold pavement agree self driving car safe make thing safe need bit danger world keep safe
autonomous car great still everyone driverless car city still turn logjam matter cpg grey said public transport solution traffic people need drive people enjoy driving thats fine life better easiest fastest cheapest choice public transport course autonomous driving technology help public transport
think people would buy right car road automated let face get automated car say always going human driver cause accident point government say road automated car theyll start letting human drive backroads inconvenient road insurance company make car insurance super expensive like cigarette discourage use personal ownership go away u join car service company run continual fleet electric car around road order one like uber show put member boom youre parking garage needed accident future definitely automated car electric automated car
guess lidar self driving car likely camera based laser arnt really intresting comercial car highspeed aerodinamics

driver le car sound like awsome taxi besides vomit cant yell unless car yell lmao
waymo train hong kongindia learn handle insurance fraud
mean let keep dumbing human specie
selfdriving car step wrong direction essentially public transport invest advanced public transport much space energy efficient would therefore help environment improve livability walkability modern city car centered wide road big city zone separated older city europe older part america much livable mixed commercial sone living zone green space provide better walkability live ability talking experience growing stockholm sweden understand car provide privacy slightly faster traveling time positive far outweighs negative car general think public transportation would solve lot problem modern city therefore driverless car way go
get main point vehicle safer human driving also believe would better reduce driving le car road mean le accident happen would better people would walk cycle use public transport thus believe government work car le space efficient even electric car polluting nox city designed us instead wide road course automatic car would beneficial arent answer traffic problem
laugh hard explained pedestrian accident
problem solver make getting license harder absolute lack ability many driver staggering yet license drive auto manufacturer oil company need consumer instead higher standard licensing keep bar insanely low consumer driverless car around make higher standard criterion control vehicle raising driving standard alone would save life going fully autonomous would terrible driving enjoyable endeavor would never want loose ability get behind wheel motorcycle full control

one new problem automation car cybersecurity external source may modifysabatoge code personal gain hacking example shown within video unless wasnt explain fully since anyone could get grab device play siren sound forcing vehicle stop get person depending update car aka remotely could vulnerability aware video example hacker remotely kill jeep highway wired game theory watch dog warning youre safe pt etc become never ending battle hacker company uping control car since internet otherwise thing good still might want manual control offroading stufffun though
moreover network car creates map lidar model camera view road surroundings get world easiest surveillance tracking privacy damned
honest yes valid point however believe future example suggested siren sound fixed due lidar probably many factor used determine whether emergency vehicle driving shape light coming siren addition future may hold system signal sort card equipped receive automatically pull something another source immediately replicate also future im sure car equipped antivirus software yes always fear massive hack ai car already advanced might future ai help prevent hack driverless car widely spread even one car somehow infected car would communicate either avoid halt traffic together course would equivalent accident today time benefit heavily outweighs risk

mujtabaalam really
thepizzabrothersgaming dude phone already track want privacy go back
youve ever driven traffic know driver phone look time avoid collision there person need ft space front traveling mph text without hitting anyone personally cant wait imagine car apart mph fast lane fast lane righthand lane exit lane swerving lane cutting car speeding dangerously mph faster surrounding traffic would get going much quicker much safer people think autonomous vehicle dangerous living bubble cut everyones data service car still wouldnt statistically close need face fact people text car home work human driver much dangerous autonomous vehicle technology getting better
waymo v stig right
selfdriving car cool still see lot issue biggest issue would fit pedestrianized society definitely need people walking biking taking public transport lower amount suburban sprawl better environment dont see selfdriving car becoming really popular outside disability group cant take bus tram mobility cycle prove safer human driver pedestrianized society fully welcome dont think people looking towards service like waymo thinking people using transport year
never happen real road big misconception autonomous driving hate people make assumption ai everything avoid risk unlike human driver would stop stuff like happening self driving car dont stunt impossible manuvers even people believe kind sad didnt research
yeah lot people enjoy driving car wont adopting technology anytime soon
give new meaning updating driver
among myriad disagreement also social conditioning learn pay attention life living daze digital screen car logically socially void mere concept appease lazy line pocket already affluent life could saved proper driver training stricter level given driver license make video appreciates discus side instead biased sugarcoated promotion
haha hilarious
read title driverless cat scared clicking video actually saw
train need rail think technology also ai car incident quiz b still think early mass produce let say testing phase
self driving car best friend beer
im shocked people distrusting technology quite obviously superior almost every way human driver im ready become reality every time get interstate see least one nearmiss someone wasnt paying attention impatient etc mean le maniac road im mean le wreck therefore fatality logicalhumane conclusion autonomous vehicle norm asap

technology available even close affordable normal car
im autonomy driverless car waymos model way scalable large metropolitan city volume ride would make sense yes amount time training take map certain area enormous car literally sandbox environment put open road there telling could plus radar lidar vision much input time get contradictory data even sensor car trust imo autonomy sense take car put anywhere road marking solved first tesla later everybody license solution developing would take much money time big city company like waymo sandbox solution taking taxi uber business driving country road trip gon na fsd drive car
people comment section imagine hacking opening laptop pressing button nobody hack car turn murderer machine
software engineer autonomous driving company feel problem facing right arent going easily solved computing power better neural network waymo seems leader industry technology definitely impressive still dont know many remote operator behind vehicle often intervene thats think technology still going ready next year unless come across really groundbreaking research
incorrect rule rd world country driving simpler easier ai follow grew california stressful driving usa people arent paying attention going think rule keep safe rd world country traffic generally much slower know dont hit someone else larger vehicle right way good go
get back thing cant hacked outside
maybe stupid question lidar work measuring reflection light send isnt danger interference like car lidar proximity
interested subject look deeper see tesla much better far ahead waymo
kind tech first world country cant imagine autonomous vehicle would drive busiest street third world country worst traffic congested city like india philippine indonesia country poor road infrastructure
believe biggest opposing would people choose uber driver dont get real job
thank taking johnnycab hope enjoyed ride
would cheaper employee office monitoring driverless car simply driving car reducing human factor operation vehicle guess monitoring learn process
cool u centric make city walkable improve public transport first
still dont think computer would save decide either plow school bus full kid let die
decision would make scenario

way technology need far year ready sure may work suburb highway would really need middle city rush everybody drive like aggressive asshole respect rule cut never give opening
think phoenix magical land rush hour
austindennis im sure country routinely drive aggressivelly reach uncomfortable level need routinely ignore traffic law rush hour otherwise getting anywhere never seen one car aggressive getting car mean minute drive becomes minute one thing useless want selfdriving car clever reduces drive time one lot better human
transit literally solves every single problem listed dont get wrong tech astonishing another excuse miserable carcentric culture u currently
sorry find like least world us car transportation
wilmeroberg yeah would better people used public transportation instead
pity sae level driverless car anywhere though driverless car geofenced area decade highresolution mapping done google every curb every painted line every traffic sign ever intersection shape literal millimetre car cant really transplanted anywhere else without high level mapping data cant drive rain snowy weather
see white knuckle start
let hope nobody dunk bucket top lidar sensor blast sound siren behind car causing stop saying likely happen may people interest stopping disabling car involuntarily also hope cyber vulnerability exploited think theyre good idea
lol driven time life large part choice learned walking biking much safest assume people driving half intelligent theyre driving assumption saved many time

human indeed unpredictable erratic human know computer certain behavior might witnessed human driver predict potential hazard may arise example motorway car pass speed change lane ahead little concern driver would slow keep distance thinking accident may imminent automated car simply register car pass continues avoiding traffic unaware oncoming accident people arguing sidewalk fight ensues someone chased human may predict erratic maneuver computer
autopilot next
least overconfident people ld ratio seems right human despicable creature
well people drive joy driving like drive vacation go joy long drive simply like drive ride bike
dont data back im betting type leisure driving constitutes miniscule portion total traffic mile automated driving really preclude manual human driving
mrharrumph yes dont think precludes future total automated traffic simple
read last message tesla autopilot mistake moon traffic light believe future
really interresting video however computer science engieener cant agree use equivalent xxx year experience argument whih often used machine learning realted communication human computer learning cant compared human understand concept regoginze pattern seeing time word computer even astonishing recent progress still take least thousand million example able get proper response really misleading compare experience time human computer human come ready use common logic able solve problem almost intuitily im confident long run computer become far perfomant human experience time comparison argument doesnt make sense like comparing apple carrot
look like regular car thats modified fully autonomous example need steering wheel regular car break think need tackle planned obsolescence vehicle become reality actual use id like know water pump fuel pump head gasket whatever else cause potentially hazardous condition isnt going fail without least detected id also curious autonomous vehicle would react flat tire
hope future wont people game watch dog car get hacked could pretty dangerous
cool cool perfect weather like snow
surveillance technology go beyond expectation imagine power hand combine starlink youll total control humanity
think autonomous vehicle going definitely going take like many autonomous tech one thing still worry though accessible tech road cleanest one lot road usa rough shape bad asphalt biggest impediment given vast sensor array quick response time amount trash pollution might worrisome aspect many time ive driving seen large plastic garbage bag cardboard box debris falling car flying road people throwing trash window semi concrete mixer construction vehicle falling gravel dirt properly secured etc imagine going mph kmh autonomous car dangerously swerving stopping potentially causing accident avoid harmless piece trash irresponsible driver chucked window front

really need better public transportation electric driverless car another bandaid solution used automotive petroleum industry profit instead actually making people life better
yes absolutely public transportation already much safer dont exactly hear subway crash plus minimal traffic since people per car remove car road build massive parking lot making walkable city healthier people really winwin
whenever people bring ethic concern like driverless car hit person person always respond think people able make decision scenario happen regular car human behind wheel would outcome somehow better
think missed point point human cant make decision circumstance therefore wouldnt judge human making wrong decision really making decision driverless car react fast enough make decision therefore becomes moral issue
apaledot ok solve moral issue whats wrong mimicking human program car something randomish like human would still get many many benefit selfdriving car leave moral issue later step forward step side sound pretty good

biggest problem autonomous car car nonautonomous trust autopilot minimum human related condition like elevator plane car much like delivery robot delivery robot cant easily prepared thief someone highly irrational stuff like throwing bottle sidewalk autonomous car vulnerable thing like drunk unhealthy unclever driver human related condition would autonomous car someone gun pointed standing road people arent afraid autonomous car instead using one others
yeah driverless car road arizona nevada california part world even many place u still far possible californian ignorant always
ai derek driving rule simple road ready also good luck countryside
see well tesla fsd beta country side doesnt even use radar us pure vision see faint round country side still manage go perfectly still make mistake tho still beta full hope tesla full self driving technology

biggest concern driverless car privacy user tracking lot new high tech car terrible privacy practice even selling driving location data
give dislike sponsored waymo car problem regardless whether autonomous see strong town bike adam something feeling made similar video time ago maybe wasnt anyway youve presented nothing new used unique feel youve become lazy copycat
future people think insane people pushed pedal control speed used big wheel control steering
think trust many human behind wheel
im truckdriver truck ave acc adaptive cruise controle take speed set kmh highway truck keep speed unless slower moving car front match speed car truck use time highway also le grand route speed varry kmh even kmh stretch street long enough hit acc button keep right speed lot truckdrivers hate technology even hate normal cruise controle driver people keep driving themselfs trouble car witouth driver cant whait drive car without anything dont care waymo tesla another car get thegnologie soon possible le people driving le crash great video greeting belgium
could anyone dislike video lol dont scared future coming whether u like
well minute advertisement paid waymo thats one reason
dont want driverless car live snowy area day winter havent got line visible sign thing summer day go
issue see fully autonomous car unlike plane road around world made automatic task yes radar camera etc work condition without proper information proving thing inside road thing go wrong point take one manager call quick fix engineer thinking case plane might seem complicated due complex nature flight fact pretty much nothing flying keeping altitude maybe avoiding collision plane sometimes
want forced ride share future want govt prevent everyone driving flexibility get want want limited available number autonomous taxi available society embrace responsibility shuns careless dangerous behavior
tesla missed huge opportunity
think av could great contribution route energetic space point view hopelessly inefficient id rather invest better infrastructure pedestrian bike public transport
think going fully driverless one leap mistake building car dual ability let car driverless auto pilot mode case emergency case driver drunk fall asleep heart attack wheel etc even importantly beef car technological feature increase driver competence limit eliminate driver blind spot example think approach greatly increase road safety quickly banking day everyone choose use driverless car
vehicle waymo experience human driver
didnt even know legal driverless car road
contact tesla owner try ride tesla fsd beta compare
need level autonomy drive indian road handle indian situation
anyone played cyberpunk need add getaway option weaponry like taxi service whose name forgotten

cool chandler arizona seeing googlewaymo past year rd added traffic drive like annoyingly overly cautious human
much hate driving even others driver would love everyone kind car already deep head still many freeze lag crash computer dont even talk blue screen death car
next driverless hgvs
ban stupid car owner first ill gladly ride driverless car
submit scream real far left nazi unison best interest scream tech may change fundamental authoritarianism left wont ever change get intrusive piss silly nazi ill drive politics art looking trouble finding everywhere diagnosing incorrectly requiring remedy make worse paid everyone else
dont think derek mean pressure using driverless car trying present safety benefit imagine going death per day u road even thats thousand people per year thats driverless car helpful would happier could buy driverless car know wasnt monitored big tech government think thats viable future long run development complete would inspected case accident like police interview driver involved accident
markwiemer weimar lol even recognize leftist academia turned america weimar republic yet cant wait bully ai imagine govt locking u home year virus helped ccp create vend never ever trust book burning left anything left say good never individual good collective good like marxist ever wont voluntary long thats left operates wait till google say driving anywhere believe george washington ideology
mmmm im sorry car bad train good
elaborate automobile form transportation enough drawback replacing human driver ai enough make superior alternative rather driverless car electric otherwise would much better served effective public transportation massive scale
leaving comment algorithm
im going first ever ride fully autonomous vehicle get surprised wow driver plot twist guess
okay
guess still expecting see human behind wheel know safety reason
yeah honestly work across street one plant toyota van go waymo one come always see driver seeing one without driver would actually shock know theyre fully autonomous still norm someone make wonder well animatronics something dw human rest easy knowing there something seat know
raiistmar charmle h id agree wasnt fully part sentence
think biggest hurdle probably much safety autonomy car decide im afraid thisll end another subscription service making person extremely rich everyone else keep paying cant go anywhere creating room people le parked car id prefer attention public transportation
agree love owning car yet im hard time figuring another subscription service making person extremely rich everyone else keep paying cant go anywhere isnt also apt description owning maintaining vehicle

cant wait self driving car still think technology year away mainstream sure computer generally drive better human nowdays thing computer cant react hard situation stuff dont see right even tesla top notch self driving feature occasion fails make bad decision car see something human way flexibel booth percieving surroundings realizing actually see reacting countless basially would end acccident preatty fast sure omputer reat faster better ccertain situation human many unccertain situation fast decicsion makingis outperformed flexibel decision making comparing advancement speed technology assume lkeast year usable mainstream booth possibly legaly
screw sponsored content question arent selfdriving car already mainstream
safety actual driving put self driving car giving control life something cant see something control im passenger normal car thing trust driver however low probability autonomous car worry wizkid understand coding computer significantly better take thinking recent news called pegasus project mobile phone send email able take control device
lidar operate poor weather though snow intense rain ice
well human operate condition better worse realise long automated vehicle operate strictly worse still safer human driver
mrharrumph long worse human sure wondered lidar would work condition normal camera would assume would least good human eye
probably problem solve rn human amazing rain snow
think clue chose phoenix trial site snow ice could big issue dont worry
depends powerful laser beam
waymo car drive certain place condition tesla fsd everything waymos currently attempt drive condition ideal
problem still need update road car missing stop sign could cause horrible accident also id worried kid messing sensor pre driving check year maybe u long way till find reliable solution bad weather uk rain year every day lidar wont work
skater see somebody would run stopped vehicle
dont think better computer choosing human creature choice freedom want become community like movie walle

tesla fsd
well good someone hack navigation crash car
omg airplane land mind blowing realization mean knew typically autopilot always thought pilot manipulates plane ground
mind
make place vehicle cluster see drive vehicle autonomous vehicle let say small village autonomous vehicle would interesting see
people saying resource spent autonomous driving instead used public transportation assume live city public transportation good solution urban setting feasible people live rural area people saying walk cycle thats realistic people commute mile work every day
think technology behind selfdriving car awesome also think let waymo marketing video seems like weird choice science education channel certainly believe robot drive better also believe must easier safer cheaper solution myriad problem posed individual human driving swarm car everywhere america
shouldnt keep people working
think comparison mkm experience autonomous car human driver somewhat misleading since human least moment learn much efficiently data ai another question data security
really cant wait cant come sooner hate driving hate driver car autonomous
although agree sentiment safer etc video implicitly misleads timeline saying sooner think fact critical technology roll broad scale slowly next year optimism general way strong thus sponsored puff piece
taxi driver id pissed
autonomous driving require steering wheel pedal mirror
car replaced autonomous car actually achieve least safe driving autonomous car car around able communicate autonomous car like knowing car speed route etc thus significantly reduces accident
feel like youre objective driving perfect ideal condition didnt see rain happens youre snow storm lidar get jammed get bird sht camera happens get flat tire lose power steering see car video brand spanking new thats realistic still least year technology
im gon na stop right germany nobody ever said human better driver ai germany wont driverless car highest court constitutional courtsupreme court stated computer never allowed make decision hurt case accident like crash car dodge hit pedestrian thats germany least maybe dozen year level autonomy
person remote controlling driving car home aka work home
personally driverless car hell tram hell yes
say im fairly disappointed veritasiums content think successful testing one driest place country really prove whole lot also driverless car system created equal tesla system lidar indeed hit stationary object yes know tesla isnt level crack musk selling lidar also struggle certain condition rain snow phoenix arizona doesnt see lot speaking rain snow varying road condition north go perfect grip zero grip foot would system detect black ice doesnt even ability detect road wet finally happens system get old start seeing degradation sensor processor anyone seen computer work bug free year end silicon valley cant even get laptop cellphone last couple year let alone car aerospace qualified engineering bug happen car cause crash responsible owner wasnt driving fault company make system isnt going accept liability vehicle dont liability issue mean well one fewer owner car road company demand operate fleet like done company able develop technology weve seen one two provider available looking isps cost go higher ultimately think hopeful naive look subject watch channel usually dive deeper technology driverless car year legal framework least
percent people think average driver necessarily statistical anomaly driving skill normally distributed sure though possible driver actually better average
good point although think may confusing term average high point median bell curve distribution average possible median distribution yes possible skewed distribution
start feel like train plane
car becomes commodity instead property subject maximum profit
future self driving car preserve drunk idiot ie people incapable banned driving
put one nyc see
tesla better
speaking replacementsso auto part wear self inspection programssure happens visual sensor fail use
would love one car dont seem affordable
would taxi driver earn money hard
jayvir jadeja think
tesla crashing turned truck terrifying
crashed quite slow car brake heavily emergency delayed pure computer error still mile safer human
learning experience many instance overturn vehicle semi truck road probably seemed like overpass vehicle though sure people driving encountering type situation fed algorithm computerai learn object avoid show road autonomous vehicle drive better human road lack identifying strange rare object road need learn avoid best way possible recommend check ai drivr youtube see video vehicle navigate brutals intersection california
vybz human would turned way braked time reason would safer driver intoxicated otherwise distracted road case probably arent responsible enough even road begin
would love autonomous car time time id enjoy driving let honest good ai good hardware would drive safer efficient
im guessing waymo losing lot money thing
yes sadly enough deter put business
didnt find video day piss youtube
main issue driverless car moral dilemma case unavoidable accident car save single passenger sacrifice passenger save group pedestrian bus full people prioritize woman men child senior etc knowing way big tech work day almost certainty mind car wont prioritize passenger cost nonstarter im prepared sacrifice life save two complete stranger even car
would prefer road filled autonomous vehicle locally average vehicle limit quarter many change lane without checking blind spot without using blinker texting mention avoid oncoming traffic least week forget stay lane need autonomous vehicle properly tested
used waymo skeptical driverless car
know mass transit kidding isnt like software based system ever failed intentionally sabotaged
work narrow street old european city example street u huge comparison
auto collision pretty common always airplane collision rare always elevator collision always never
yep thats car automated last need sophisticated software three
fair there elevator collision ground someone crash side freeway overpass wouldnt say car wasnt collision hit wall instead another car
elevator crash rare never probably forgetting crash bottom actually likely top balance weight heavier case elevator crashed ceiling
point comment
plane collide ground everytime land see use language sound clever ultimately say nothing
anyone seen original total recall johnny cab impressed
feel like commercial issue many fully autonomous car remote driver monitoring limited area tech ready used every road every weather condition
isnt waymo mapped hand big problem imo take literally decade map whole world lmao
driverless car still dont solve issue pollution extreme space usage car already trivially solved bike
train serious peoplemoving
actually make perfect sense driver better average driver really bad driver easily skew distribution
problem people stem feeling example thinking make questionable best put way ill take classic city driving people drive like insane idiot well ny anyway im sure true city problem simply arent following traffic rule pressured get going dont someone else mean followed rule alone would dramatically change safe need auto driving car far le case convenience specific need like drunk driving issue put way car needed shouldnt needed enjoyed rule road need enforced first place
could also build actual good city walkable great public transportation dont need car convoluted solution unnecessary problem
many title thumbnail change algorithm
find ego pretty big reason see accident dont feel shame embarrassment tend drive way computer would fact ive lightly tapped behind drunk woman year driving every day speaks really didnt like fact control someone possibly hitting behind rainy day slightly increase distance stop car front way scenario hear car behind car behind get hit chance accelerate little avoid light tap together actually happened one time parkway new jersey rainy day traffic left gap hear bang see debris flying side hit gas car behind got managed completely avoid involvement incident also use signal time drive thru k ow might look silly point take effort use signal use recommend watching dashcam video accident get learn understand reason accident really happen
jessica sweety hotgirl vlogs ive seeing lot spam youtube account lately get paid usernamebannerchannel look way look bot dont hear back ill assume youre bot copy comment someone already wrote spam reply comment
driverless car mass adopted probably inevitability dont think human controlled car ever phased there something full autonomy youre behind wheel driverless car never able substitute freedom able go wherever want whichever manner whatever speed would also probably impossible navigate back country dirt road especially unsure want go cant input concrete destination
would really rather car tbh tech paired policy le parking better zoning better sidewalk better bikelanes fantastic
big game changer haulage type system get ported lgv hgv going change lot shipping logistics world
driverless car built like driver car whats point steering wheel
feel human worse driving vehicle dont good school driving canada possible get license without ever taking driving lesson human make mistake compared driverless car necessarily technology computer better
lot plus side also large downside lack independence ease freedom travel could restricted removed individual community
cant get people wear mask get vaccinated enact sensible gun control youll never get people car unless force dont see happening rest lifetime
money handle hire taxi driver truck driver ai job cheaper safer bye commercial driver rest insurance get considerably cheaper car driven ai would huge impact dont even need get driver car make street safer
marcind suppose get human equation still accident death road people wont want stop driving willingly car part culture wont easy
tesla better waymo paying try attentionbut time tell bye
completely agree technological aspect human inherently worse driver although think mentioned costusability argument especially nonoptimized setting like chaotic traffic asia africa unpaved road completely offroad vehicle able handle situation cost argument also important view currently low cost car especially developing country also germany example drive mitsubishi mirage without technical equipment bought euro new vehicle allow cheap transportation method region simply alternative fe rural area argument considered especially proposing idea banning human driver road entirely although number accident go social divide wealthy economically disadvantaged people created based accessibility transport even developed country great video technological psychological aspect
thats mad flipped vehicle centre screen yet also distracted pedestrian didnt notice skipped aside
elon musk say lidar bad doesnt work doesnt use guess crash wouldnt happened tesla lidar
yes need driverless time come love tech main danger tech government force government never mandate tech mandated acclimation always end badly government force tech people dont want wasting precious taxpayer dollar subsidizing forcing unknown tech people manufacturer criminal
believe work well taxi service would far much personally wonder would cheaper drive vehicle one day driverless car would cheap enough owning vehicle would costly either way convenience vehicle drive whenever ready instead waiting autonomous vehicle may gotten stuck traffic pick better option think term owning car technology always much average consumer safety many thing go wrong phase life kept professional researcher accident seeing due driver hitting way around become major thing outsourced rd party company rent use taxi service come across poorly maintained autonomous vehicle many thing need maintained keep working condition hope people would working never become lazy skip test maintenance deem probably good enough day thats human error lol one day true automation everything autonomous maintained autonomously thats driverless car would truly shine world among nothing autonomous vehicle
convinced car driving suburb highway parking lot thats fairly easy predictable crossing messy turnaround multiple lane large asymptomatic crossing without marking really hard find lane situation even human concentrate automatic vehicle shine
lidar affected bunch car near
right till someone hack system one time thousand die instant thanks
hypothetically future quantum computing perfected super ai created one try destroy human car created keep u safer lol would cool though id love ride one
science fun always solving problem creating new problem solving problem creating new problem
fun hacker take control one car
every car america exact time tell speed crash
mriiin right perfect terrorism min
lociflow thinking year terrorist organization wont recruiting chemist nuclear physicist looking computer science degree
mriiin exaclty computer programing isnt really rare thing day everyone pc soon everyone drive ai car thing go money want use credit instead actual money last week grocery store named coop sweden shut whole contry hacker got data base noone could buy food store happens terrorist organisation deletes everyones bank account yep money lost work like clockwork terrorist could steal fingerprint phone photo stored online server gg humanity
produce industrially drawback
entire industry get axed truck driver cab driver delivery driver going weird time near future
driverless car run red light stop sign get ticket consequence stop
im electrical automation engineer disagreement conclusion statistically true driverless car safer human driver wont acceptable level safety improvement majority car autonomous reason critical factor safe driving ability predict another vehicle going human far better algorithm predicting another human way predictive power computer equal human predicting autonomous car perfect accuracy mix human driver algorithm algorithm continue get involved unsafe situation also computer going good reacting dynamic condition weather construction debris etc human dont good enough sensor tech yet think basic example noticing driver ahead distracted avoid driving blind spot notice vehicle ahead tire poor condition may blow increase follow distance driving algorithm cant thing really safest thing would least car autonomous communicating shared network traffic infrastructure would see unprecedented level safety till there going problem
car braked suddenly
computer taking task make human insecure usefulness thats
standard future whether like
must imagine algorithm happy stressing wether involved accident today ai almost get hit cyclist close engineer mmm close put another billion mile driving make sure ai aaah
people could average median youd need remaining pretty darn bad
thinking doesnt necessarily bell curve also personal experience feel bad driver openly admit
driven mile theyre arizona live drive place rain snow varied driving experience waymo come man youre vancouver might decade till handle weather
adaptability change human clearly struggled work theory conformational bias ppl search fact figure support idea without asking right question
happens happen get pulled driverless car who fault manufacturer passenger
get video need catchline one pretty bad
hi derek car drive night car vision also reduce right another car dim light approach side way car handle
carcentric american stroads yeah totally work anyones goal design city autonomous car please make follow video
another great video great message would love become norm around live
want see navigates congested road heavy traffic jam vehicle close together
better average driver
want see people like trip taking time long car wont speed
many year self driven car standard
wait hear self drivning car basically train advance public transportation space efficient better environment
wrong car dont make useless stop
self driving car also electric
calvinrichards say tesla fsd car mostly gas actually
pawer cough red light see point
alanhuang car driverless wont needed meant need go l car take straigh train take whole alphabet
evolve grow together like aspin grove borg im totally
pedestrian bridge road would necessary aswell
would feel lot comfortable didnt think people going heavily pressured vehicle get tired driving dont want lose option need choice
mile driven real road tesla autopilot lv comma openpilot lv waymo lv
tesla autopilot feature every type autonomous driving number level autonomy mile
nick arjoma thats true tesla autopilot level autonomy whereas waymo operates level wonder lidar ever becomes standard future autonomous car camera work sufficiently well
nick arjoma didnt say
nick arjoma looking forward future selfdriving tech
nick arjoma yes right comment irritating way written ive changed clarity
cool really need walkable city
fully support continued development adoption driverless car always feel like proponent never mention weather handle heavy downpour snow ice road dense fog technology seems ready looking perfect road weather condition ie california show driverless car safely navigating snowy road plow didnt follow lane perfectly
motorcyclist cant wait road populated autonomous car distracted irresponsible careless dangerous driver take awareness capacity riding
car drive exactly speed limit
technology isnt year away widespread adoption definitely
next pandemic msm guilt shame scare u give freedom driving order save life like label anyone unvaccinated killer irresponsible label anyone drive car way really looked like snowflake hiding bubble like need big brother tech protect big bad world sad really
sensor dropout software bug tesla issue update caused problem gear shifting comparing car plane elevator complete equivocation elevator stupidly simple device given enough time competent high schooler could program functional one measure safety incident per trip elevator safest mode transportation commercial airliner complex really one operational point failure landing oversight competent air traffic controller freedom three dimensional motion obstacle avoidance risk midair collision almost nil want mitigate traffic improve safety pressure local politician cut red tape build subway get rid unpredictable winding suburban road culdesacs add traffic circle prevent needle idling red light europe asia got thing figured could learn lot following example
autopilot landing also support infrastructure localizer glideslope
human driver heart attack seizure stroke blinded sun etc besides fact waymo thought concern waymo vehicle dont perfect safer average human driver sound like want even safe reduce driving using subway regardless driverless vehicle going work place change transportation many u
lost gear shifting
flinx human driver wont heart attack seizure etc single flawed update could result widespread pileup could overflow hospital well clog roadway preventing ambulance dealing situation would far worse covid even experiment demonstrate reduction accident relative average driver guarantee level performance continue future experienced unreliable technology breaking worst possible moment life without forewarning ever present part modern life phone work flawlessly year update cause everything destabilize certainly gather performance data prior update would look like everything fine every objective standard im sorry conceive empirical result would convince selfdriving car worth risk simply much stake put faith blackbox algorithm definition inscrutable
pronouncedoiler single flawed update could result widespread pileup thats tesla test deploys software im sorry wont convinced scary dismaying coming year decade vehicle around selfdriving
car cause accident insurnce go passenger go lol
much car though
automated driving vehicle change life person incapable license due disability ability take grocery store wife work would vastly improve state excited technology
also shoutout thumbnail badly photoshopped passenger seat noticed xd amazing
want read book sleep commute genius idea take bus train public transportation thing american way cant solve problem unless overengineer spend trillion way stop disingenuous comparison human ai experience youd drive thousand year etc wouldnt like dont look two million picture cat tell cat dog sound like obnoxious marketing
let hacking commence soon becomes viable commercial venture group figure way insert ransom ware let car signed bank account
sure ive seen video newish car already super hackable much electronics
ransoming ability use car maybe ransoming lifefreedom much emergency service could almost certainly handle situation could understand going
im hoping next year big city people voted year away may spot actual major implementation
ensrick actually bureaucracy crony politics history elite sabotaging within take target among reason cant trust automated car passenger seat owner automation system control robot fooling taking manual control also u literally arent map included
would say think implemented everywhere within next year india exists
yeah sound right would expect seeing full autonomy working well small deployment year advance widespread adoption thats thing usually go brand new technology im glad see finally happening agree ten year away people think derek probably know
telling year decade
lokiscarletwashere owner automation system control robot fooling taking manual control thats already possible though selfdriving car wont change
want driverless car road want real functional effective public transport american road
work population density variable line smaller town wont ever subway monorail even bus except school bus lol
would need redesign entire country feasible connect endless suburb america reliable cost efficient public transport work densely populated area america
fascinating waymo accomplished remain curious approach become gold standard involves premapping road reason driverless waymo vehicle limited area mapped company autonomous driving space attempting get vehicle drive wherever whenever thats incredibly complex youll find youtube video car driving unmarked dirt road
see vehicle way experience average driver
suggested vehicle heavy traffic self driving rubberbanding startstop traffic would nearly eliminated random distribution takeup zone provided correct following distance autonomous vehicle tailgate
driverless car dont perfect make le mistake human year
""
hmmm guess airbus crash paris demonstration computer incorrectly overrode pilot far back remember cherry picking example bolster argument well scientific
trip roadless region example arab word alot ppl visit desert camp
use normal wheel
well would work heavy rain snow
way way better human
jeffdunhamvevo debatable lidar radar cant function heavy rain snowplus snow able read line road
theyre safe let serious take year get thing done
way safer human actually
jeffdunhamvevo really year probably cant pas driver test thing arent simple
comparing cat aircraft landing autonomous car comparing apple apple airport equipped cat approach equipment guide plane runway even along taxiway gate aircraft figuring surroundings like autonomous car also deal traffic pedestrian etc
cough cough il approach
measuring driving experience hour mile significant measuring number category accident training set someone driving delhi paris day learns someone driving arizona year demo drive saying much safety say much fascination machine human basic maneuver first hour driving class endless chatter passenger cover ear
driverless car going deal aggressive driver dont follow common sense rule give driver courtesy example common problem experience driving entrance ramp enter highway idiot cross yellow line block entrance lane run ramp stuck side road traffic going fast merge safely driverless car cant deal alltoocommon scenario lot stuck side road major problem everywhere cant foresee easy solution
solution letting human drive ever
every problem get solved even better solved propper public transport
human need someone blame thing go wrong something someone thats key hurdle overcome unless literally perfect unachievable doesnt matter system better average human driver pointed many driver think theyre better something go wrong theyre looking blame another human
well overcome hurdle autonomous elevator somehow thats big issue really need somebody blame sue company
fiso tried sueing company
paulelderson enough case entirely impossible like said elevator worked fine
fiso somehow feel offended used argument elevator twice even derek wasnt st say video
razorbaze still applies
yeah great real test indian street
expect lot idiot driver raming auto mobile blaming auto mobile fault using excuse trust automobile
probably lot really far right people like really far right
sufficed say human kind dumb sometimes
make one video mind palace
car bike
issue would service ownership think autonomous car widely adopted overall much safer dont wan na wait car show want go somewhere leave place want transportation demand car always represented type freedom public transport taxi service compare
question replace single uber driver sedan minivan cost twice much plus k worth tech slapped top multiple technician looking pretty much time cat il landing done ft visibility human physically waymo drive clear sunny day human without assistance lidar radar openpilot fraction cost accident happens mostly poor decision computer never make sensor see meter away cool tech demo practical real life
robotization project entry ticket high save labor long run median uber driver income sf driverless car would cost little operate could work compare equipment wont pretend could get investment back single year ballpark estimation would suggest would probably financially viable even counting cost go hardware
cant wait worldwide available want able get drunk fk
drive storm predict bad driver sample size seemingly statistically irrelevant compared humandriven car im saying video wrong potential wrong still high
drive billion mile haltorne sample size statically irrelevant lol
kylebowles billion mile nn training simulator equivalent trillion mile statistic one year humandriven car u alone
haltorne lol one car drive much humanity combined think enough data obvious nirvana fallacy
kylebowles one car know neural network work
haltorne xd yes im computer scientist take hint man nirvana fallacy
dont think year neighborhood road sufficient handle car today road europe imagine time take catch
id love see operate place like thailand vietnam indonesia india amongst utter chaos tuk tuks motorbike car food cart drive well bali without breaking sweat ill holding paper
dont think goal tech released country
first never reach country im sorry common sense one waste poorest country yet dont think would able handle situation better derek even pointed work amongst wellmaintained road semigood driver
wilmeroberg totally agree id still like see
hello uber driver
every car driveless pedestrian cyclist becomes powerfull person road traffic everyone stand still busy street car stopping way driveless car coming driveless car neu delhi paris thats impossible
different human driver stop people exept computer wont kill anyone
cop pull youre driverless car might really help stop crazy tail light situation lead someone getting shot
pay kill busload kid
there another big advantage selfdriving car network car connected road using internet form wan communicate route traffic information stuff like heck car know turn car front going take ahead wouldnt make car decision reliable think bmw already prototype implemented car
given driverless car need make driver base id curious know affect thing like presidential motorcade driver highly trained evasive maneuver would like emergency vehicle others need yield going adopt autonomous driving well
reason automatic car full introduced considered unsafe still people road predictable automatic car road would like safe problem automatic car people unpredictable stupid driving dont adhere rule funny thing car would automatic could travel much faster safer rule wouldnt need strict computer better driving faster safer sadly thats far future people ever let go driving car
dont want car road period
id rather driverless bus need public transportation state
dont like video sponsored main subject make kind le trustworthy especially info provided exactly google video provide monetary compensation access tech review video published request change point table discussion selfdriving tech mentioned like tesla
desfortune like derek channel anyone bribed
bribed strong word video subject bias example accident information given short blurb concluding waymos fault given car something camera show second footage leading crash allow viewer decide since derek like extremely comprehensive video one big thing people still hesitant natural conclusion wasnt shown didnt want shown cant say make video le trustworthy minimum acknowledge possibility biased
video artificially promoted platform
desfortune data misrepresented video doesnt mention disconnection human prevent crash one car happened time period around another risky simulation say probably wouldnt crashed also doesnt mention car accident preventedbyhuman accident distance across nationwide average weather time day level intoxication human driver would accident bar last point mentioned go read report people veritasium know extremely dishonest cherry pick talking point
exactly thinking gotten unrelated sponsor think first time he done dont like
im wondered already know already exist somewhere however problem stopping believe want best driver around world abandon manualhandled car upgrade autonomous one said video human one made error crucial alchogolics rushing people one making road safe moment dont believe car like would safe driver would crash car human made error exceptional situation avoid crashing lastly concern driving winter snow cover view road slippery
people think theyre good driver thats right im ok bc respect system try attentive good way
hopefully pro pilot chime understanding cat autoland cant get visual runway plane better physical pilot still better landing plane smoother faster knowing crab etc
think ai basically equally good little better wont miss something like throttle
wilmeroberg sure one measure many also wouldnt able sully hudson airplane accident often freak stuff breaking someone playing phone ai fix exception opposite car
airplane pilot different drive plane weve got computer long time pilot emergency plane kill people emergency
plane autopilot condition stable predictable driving take one idiot driver mess traffic flow
case yes tenerife airport disaster totally caused pilot error
bobblacka couldnt agree confused people always compare car plane talking autopilot driver license pilot plane people know plane fly even takeoff landing telling hour intercontinental flight pilot gon na board plane excited responsible
makosb sure stating correct shall remove human pilot airplane eliminate human error human error sure wont last disaster caused human error however human judgement complicated process modern knowledge hardly scratch surface scientist doesnt even know people dreaming ask gaming video card company produce chip simulate process great making progress saying ready put real life practice english suck cant find word
simeng fu cause disaster without doubt due pilot error klm pilot took without clearance tower panam cleared runway wanted point worst aviation disaster history caused kind emergency personally would prefer passenger plane human pilot think people would air travel absolutely much safer vehicular travel yearly amount people killed road usa alone equivalent medium passenger jet crashing every day said emergency situation time human pilot would able better job british airway flight perfect example unfortunately opposite extreme would air france
human suck driving period cpg grey right ban human driver road
like video soon start watching thats level confidence
make video people wanting get bored like something time maybe use example like selfdriving car people working inside instead bored people getting phone soon theyre bored
yes already excited autonomous car want soon possible didnt need convice good thing video knew wouldnt learn anything new watching watched anyway excited idea great video autonomous car great personally think creating automatic traffic system city next big thing since invention internet
id rather america actual functional safe public transportation tbh would allow le parking lot green space human interaction equal access transportation tech cool ig
yeah city dont even bus nevermind subway something
self driving car car immense waste limited earth natural resource instead focusing public transport reasonable city planning
everyone life city
bike
jeffdunhamvevo far willing ride bike
terryjones okay make better country planning
volvolakaemma sure let whip trillion dollar properly pave reconstruct every road u like government important thing spend tax moment idea much interstate cost connecting u coast coast high speed road one largest economic undertaking ever taken government ridiculous demand would get material honestly probably looking different perspective living rural area v city dont think truly comprehend big spread country really
dont u think future super computer predict happen next like predict future like like know whole life story
anti human let make people obsolete unless saving firing driver distributed people disaster
wait till youll get blue screen death
criminal come front car ideally would run car straight vehicle car would stop unsafe car never safe dont want car stop pedestrian vehicle rest fine
want high speed rail
yea
cgp grey also made video autonomous car would severely cut back inner city traffic congestion people suck driving always wouldnt surprised humanoperated car eventually banned highdensity area like inner city keep navigable
implement society though need another subscription company made make profit another move towards future one owns anything anymore love technical stuff make possible however think need debate towards going use system personally become like public transport owned partially owned government company get much power transportie increasing price everyone sold car time tell allow company become another amazon apple handle way everyone profit rich
dont automated car company send car every province state take provincial state driving test drive well better person youd think could get licence
hah licence photo would picture circuit board
think driver way average ive never drove car got license year ago waiting technology much
important part touched little end video fact car road autonomous could talk make kind prediction would almost impossible crash unlike human driven car
car fully autonomous need headlight
cant fckn wait wish would come sooner esp city selfdriving vehicle along mass transit scale plus actually walkable city id happy camper
wouldnt cheaper people office drive car
im sorry came tesla got google hey thanks nice surprise
whoaelevators used driver know feeling heard car driverless cant wait car without driver became mainstream remember day car used driver
test suggestion car hard detect thin cardboard thin rod want see stoping
nah mate havent finished driver license driverless car take ill get one cant drive tho thanks
quite possible people average driver median
lol fair point
cant wait get self driving telsa graduate
tesla scam
ive always thought insane much trust confidence average person put driving autonomous vehicle clearly future standard enormous improvement society couldnt favor also think system would much better sorting configuring route within big city rush hour would eliminated
driverless car get ticket pay ticket
driverless car wont really speed person behind wheel company knowing u probably lawsuit
going get car driver passengerless order save climate
next big innovation carless car also known bike
cant wait till machine move u around everything u effort everything worthwhile human experience soon obsolete arent lucky
accident million people died would affected global population reduce early death need control birth rate
waymo using training wheel lidar radar needed achieve level autonomy camera neural net waymo work selected premapped area closer train track fully autonomous vehicle tesla working generalized solution full self driving mean able drop anywhere world itll able drive lidar crap useless food thought
bad idiot speeding left lane dont realize poorly drive
become mandatory im longer able drive want need pay prohibitively high insurance premium soon driving becomes niche hobby exclusively wealthy people would relinquish freedom safety deserve neither
unscalable google approach long till abandon complete rewrite
unscalable
make video people getting lazy invention helped like selfdriving car washing machine etc
let know start driving indian road would real test
yeah especially come small town road
might even move becsuse people keep crossing road
dont need capable driving india able drive somewhere else bet country much earlier india live europe
thesavantart said let know ready india never said capable diving india inorder driven european country
nepali road xd
well work snowyicy weather hilly area
great video however im surprised one talking tesla lol theyre gon na eat waymos lunch year mark word
unlike tesla waymo actually self driving car tesla far away
ascarez havent dug deep enough waymo ahead sadly wrong building lmao matter whats hood see surface waymo robotaxis premapped area expensive sensor like lidar tesla point near future generalized solution meaning theyll able drop vehicle anywhere planet earth gon na able drive safely relying vision camera
oh fully autonomous passenger car fleet would according study increase amount passenger car lot due comfort etc need think traffic system whole forget trunk line american way often
look boring drive dont anything whats wrong manual gearbox taking responsibilty
chandler az get inch rain every year zero snow ill wait see working buffalo ny
road perfect car get large well marked regular
id rather develop ideal condition first start working weatherroad condition problem eliminated aspect dont put student driver difficult intersection first lesson either
paulelderson thats valid mtheory also make really good point inclement weather unpredictable extra carbon atmosphere coughcough isnt truly realistic drive rain sleet snow without worry issue especially night
garyv doubt bad think come weather weather condition road mostly readily available via apis already soon know raining adjusts parameter fine poorly maintained road definitely bigger issue isnt car fault road would dangerous human driver ya know fix road
since waymo basically taxi serviceuber type company could allow car travel road deemed safe weird intersection dirt road something dont allow car properly trained roadway adjusted
plane something completely different path predetermined well sky huge probability plane coliding km alt car hand many variable alone road autonomous vehicle would scared shitless least vehicle road would autonomous id say problem better yet vehicle functioning sync like hivemind still ready
cool n need realize nothing control control human move go technology need abused power mark word
keep mind airplane land massive infrastructure radio tower exists airport plus government agency monitoring every single plane time around airport least authority tell everybody fly enormous safety margin air traffic exist car environment car move much complex autonomous driving even remotely comparable airplane control software airplane need realtime computer vision operate automous car probably going see autonomous car relatively soon safe perfect condition car expected work every weather every traffic situation waymo tell cockup want portray product best light much would love see share optimism
well put
waymo tell cockup erm waymo published paper crasher public road year
jehty sorry thats meant engineer doubt know work doesnt discus public pretty sure exact specification condition let car loose public street confident technology operate vehicle streaming rain night mean selfdriving car worthless may want scrap humandriven car
arnoschaefer recall correctly waymo also published condition drive also published paper rain drive test maybe check website edit get saying saying waymo far tell quite open product guess thats way get public trust car
future pirate field day stand infront car occupant open season
playing ambulance siren loudspeaker force park lol
secondary problem blocked vision turn due overgrown bush human driver contact local road agency autonomous vehicle
trigger warning use nonscientific unit measurement
excellent video derek waymo solution indeed promising exciting work av ccam general still see lot work done homologation harmonization standardization handling edge case make fraction percentage traffic situation still significant number lvl like lvl restricted odds operational design domain full lvl traffic system huge leap away mixed traffic lvl unit
buuut one never actually drived wouldnt natural
delamain service
cant wait prohibit human driver
also drive would enable productive youd spend le energy commuting
thats ugliest car ever made
think driverless car come late world reduction commuter huge amount worker able work home think itll great increase mobility hopefully reduce crash
soon lot career
sample size though derek
million time second well he going hate said
dont feel video explored downside skepticism much im disappointed
give example downside
fortnite heard someone mention big tech could manipulate car would potential problem doesnt even make sense consider money made hostile takeover automated vehicle could see perhaps asking vehicle go burger king might suggest mcdonalds first clever advertising scheme point also nullified google map already search result biggest inconvenience would scrolling sorry paragraph wanted share thought would love hear downside automated vehicle
broden well people say big tech manipulates car theyre talking monopolizing think google aka waymo tech giant automated driving service could set whatever price want even could actually buy car youd whim company continuing support could easily add necessary paid subscription something case dont really several downside well example often repeated opinion even video automated driving would solve traffic problem plenty reason might case car automated reduce amount car street fact might increase may bit faster might improve traffic definitely solution much better tried tested method city planning walkable space mind public transportation u particularly bad regard give impression people latch idea autonomous driving instead actual city planning train network autonomous driving upside well like video complete lie anything believe anyone try argue safety bring trying justify themself much clearly cut dry video implies
fortnite job million job million mortgage rent car boat holiday dinner family driving job held people unable unsuitable attend higher education thought automated checkout supermarket bad seems beginning
grimsworld sure million job disappear however new one cant think moment might spring argument thrown around last year hasnt turned true yet agree possibility
id say next decade highly influenced new technology field travelling traffic accident way common nowadays need fixed either autonomous car road system betterfaster public transport whatever
always change title video day posting
face say hit vehicle car wasnt moving
im getting soon get europe
really wanted hear something object recognition example car kmh highway plastic bag blow across road quickly recognise something safe hit stamp brake ideal person car behind also kmh checking phone doesnt think possible one ahead would unexpectedly brake highway course car behind also driverless car problem scenario
autonomous car doubt good thing society im around someone loved car since could remember though going sad see driving taken away people enjoy
really people enjoys horse riding still enjoy driving still place fun
theyre used data get better become
dont know would comfortable driverless car among car driver eagerly anticipating time vehicle driverless communicate one another coordinate safe travel human unpredictable even known bully driverless vehicle
commute work long enough could sleep way
vehicle waymo experience human driver
well tesla ceo say dont need lidar autonomous car say
lidar work rain snow fog dust storm make work wont reliable
even better almost every vehicle road autonomous communicate
grand father would tell time would go visit friend dinner horse drawn buggy little much drink would let horse drive back home took nap trusted horse bring home safely
cant wait stuff like legally blind hard get arround place without public transportation moment public transportation doesnt seem like good idea due pandemic
work india
suppose many dislike come currently working professional driver always political decision turn something beautfiul ugly
never wanted people drive tbh skill skill every person fsdc imo needed
beautiful ballet self driving car mean unwalkable city
elon musk said lidar fool game go far anyone idea talking trying figure thats busniess move try downplay another competitor really belief something lidar system gatekeeping expanding
snow rain
vehicle fatality best way get rid idiot people want fix whats next make vaccinate
yeahbut still chrysler
well thats horrible workplace
two reason cant come fast enough im cyclist im always nervous driver arent paying attention driverless car always pay attention also like stand paddling id love get board car one spot tell car meet downstream dont paddle back tide
yea incredible awesome cant take one hunting xing
im motorhead love car motorbike driving really want tech everyday life see many driver really dont want right behind wheel vehicle distract thing instead focusing road traffic
bottle clorox inside vehicle
really like delamain cab
backseat driver would get heart attack
hey im truth toilet swirl smarter everyday
world adrift music respect
car use headlight night
thank making video almost seems crazy people dont want self driving car based statistic current development technology spreading awareness key
car polite many driver seen plenty people letting emergency car buch weirdo
yeah im sign
im afraid technology like distract u badly city designed instead tech like investing public transportation walkable city tech make u even car reliant also really curious long work busy cyclist city like amsterdam copenhagen
dont worry itll work fine amsterdam like fine cyclist pedestrian effectively right way everywhere realise car always stop long respect law physic rather traffic law sort apply human driver behind wheel av passenger however exercise patience
anyone actually enjoys car enjoys driving hell literal hell
bet manual car still around hobby like there still people ride horse also like driving id take automatic car dealing entitled bmw driving prick endangering constantly
paulsmithgibf honestly understand personally im happy put shitty driver mean get small moment joy excitement get nothing better group mate car zipping twisties going roaptrips know even commuting make drive enjoyable really want besides idk know trying get part car year old car hard enough let alone standard car longer made manual car well sadly already pretty much dead besides learning drive right passage believe lot people believe aswell could go day ill stop cause im sick typing social medium phone general anyways enjoy daynight
thanks choose life
curious happen hundred car using lidar time
ever wondered captchas choose bike crossing school bus know genius idea
wait wow
aasimwz ai deep learning
woah
doesnt captcha system already know whats correct beforehand pick wrong need another check
captcha already know whats correct ppl dont need u teach machine
impression u far ahead term regulation kind technology id love see europe rest world
problem way fortunate reality europe way pedestrian cyclist necesarrily problem car learn deal remove pro self driving car beautiful balet self driving car would impossible many country eu always pedestrian cyclist want cross road although possible self driving car come eu take much time also netherlands actually decent public transport go every backwater town would le demand self driving car
cant wait day robot maid feed food
thought said driverless cat first
mean elevator free dont think ill experience time taxi free
elevator arent free think money maintain come pay rent eat restaurant pay little fee
wilmeroberg optional provide money maintain elevator dont therefore free
support want driverless car soon possible
people giant corporation industry conspired make sure automobile dominated transport rather alternate form transport
driverless car reach tipping point sign road actively communicate car car talk car traffic much smoother big possible issue hacker
took self driving car course decade ago ever since get behind wheel car shake head thinking waste time drive
tiana kaia excellent point fair amount work self driving car determine position world problem called localization problem gps right capable locating car foot actually need know position car accurately inch cm one reason camera lidar unit lot car fair amount software taking foot accuracy inch interesting point regarding gps european gps system accurate cm u blocking military reason problem trying use gps nyc exercise frustration building block signal many point discus could write phd thesis topic problem slowly surely solved
arent expecting human better derek thats dont want computer driving damit hard understand ai managed derek problem implementation going enable everyone buy automated vehicle dont trust human act like robot biggest concern human either intentionally reflex cause accident either driverless driven car dont think better automation nobody thats fking dumb derek certainly dont think suck either problem hormone let u act uncontrollably time cause problem traffic consisting driven driverless car completely driverless speed limit locked pure automated traffic would faster well actually save big time traffic light
sooooo favor gradual implementation driverless car
romanski enable environment every huge majority car automated make sure system basically unhackable company company trustworthy say stupid rich guy government official convince company charge system make forced accident anyone want im otherwise id like take control fate
tillthelighttakesus profit incentive make company inherently trustworthy mean never favor driverless car
would love diverless car happening place many year still mean took least year train vehicle perfect condition drive pretty good take drive eg snow cannt see road line sign eg chaotic traffic like let say india rule followed
dont know want control come thing like
thats waaay unsafe propose
trust machine work better human dont trust machine unhackable people could held hostage inside car terrorist could cause immense chaos authoritarian government could cause accident get rid political dissident etc possibility endless perhaps car could unhackable external access car made completely physically impossible cut outside signal whatsoever bet left arm government use excuse crime fighting ensure external access vehicle remains hacker use exactly access advantage
elevator hacked
romanski yes case elevator hacked however hacked elevator relatively harmless elevator independent mechanical safety brake make impossible fall go fast go one direction dedicated shaft cant crash anything despite horror scenario see movie basically worst happen hacked elevator stuck someone secretly listening conversation elevator phone someone getting access apartment office directly accessible elevator therefore hacked elevator wont cause death hacked car easily could big difference
seeing video reinforces suspicion would outlaw manual driving autonomous car might unethical driver couldnt mix car way car broke guy pushing cart would eventually end someone hitting behind pulling emergency vehicle always best course action fire engine want overtake busy one lane road everyone need keep moving pull else theyll brake everybody theyre parked pas side clear
cant make manual driving illegal unless theyre minority driverless car proven safer several year make manual driving public road illegal hope happen aforementioned condition
tell tf pedestrian supposed cross
found new hobby plating ambulance noise autonomous car autonomous car ready
germany hobby would illegal
veritasium really stepped fill void vsause left
afraid driverless car tbh afraid mix driverless car car driver dont trust human driving
technology around much safer human driving issue state road road marking
waymo would run bunch commie blocking street asking free money decent taxpayer like waymo would wait patiently move away without hurting anyone wrong answer
taxation wrong theft imo shouldnt tax whatsoever tax communist want tax communist country becomes

sound super expensive messy know people pushing stuff dont care cost safety want cool new stuff
driverless car outsourcing car support overseas call center
yes voluntarily give source income well guess dying silently room lot bearable people fiery accident
thank taking johnny cab happens autonomous vehicle attacked vandalized expensive lidar system stolen become armored weaponized
camera
happens car
cause car getting hit meteor
love really fully sponsored video editorialize product made parent company whose platform produce content positive light contrasting argument round part call ad vertical integration squeezin every bit juice lemon didnt know marketing opinion compared great work video feel vaporous insincere willfully ignorant completely gloss negative current selfdriving vehicle saying ideal condition great avoid discussion construction zone emergency etc cant wait til thief realize get waymo stop drive away even gun mock cyclist running car okay cyclist rightofway car kept going stopped front cyclist awkward stopped man cart dont really justify mocking tone enough evidence event considering waymo doesnt drive like average driver throw others cause worse situation driver unsure wtf robot car wish going evangelize selfdriving car hard would least distinguished technology better even go work physically could mentioned waymos competition like technology tesla us much trickable viewer dont inherently understand there difference entire extra kit sensor car like waymo v strapping webcam onto fleet customer betatest ifelse statement life
""
dont hate im kind person doesnt like kinda stuff sure cool world become everything technology personally kinda wan na drive car learn experience lazy opinion
lazy work driving
people better average driver average doesnt mean median
would intensely scary distribution low end lol
real integral alternative whole world better public transportation course automated public transportation thinking mobility problem accident pollution access solved everybody whole world owning driverless car definitely correct answer going happen also bike
american imagine able read paper daily commute dutch dont imagine good public transit already
palomnyk also live postage stamp
palomnyk yea beautiful city parkinglots
someguytykr american love make point like theyre commuting boston san diego every day american live denselypopulated urban corridor
falsum living postage stamp give additional economic benefit train system theyre commuting although public transportation system bridge different city efficiently car additionally although unrelated current point america largely urbanized invention car better researched u public transportation would know older preautomobile city actually good public transport clueless european look la tv think oh america primitive folk wholly unearned arrogant streak mile wide
vehicle stopped remain stopped oncoming vehicle fully passed vehicle creeping rolling
best way fully test capability self driving car put third world country traffic
want car bed
snowstorm hello
secure system run
car interact together lidar interfere
actually radar well
strange talk autonomous driving without even mentioning tesla fsd true dont fully autonomous vehicle regularly travelling without driver taking much harder problem waymo also strange talk waymo autonomous driving without mentioning main drawback rely externally generated map function unmapped area indeed mapped area significantly changed since mapping waymo million mile experience sound impressive tesla data least billion mile regular car driving tesla fsd work unmapped street yes mean work still requires constant driver supervision though still kink need intervention close frequently travel half hour city street intervention waymo cant unmapped area still point video correct autonomous driving close possible everywhere within year decade point elevator problem probably made worse medium cover every single autonomous driving incident ignores much common deadly human caused accident like electric vehicle fire get lot press gasoline vehicle fire hardly ever mentioned despite much much common
everyone smart would invest self driving car stock driv etf diversifies many stock involved bringing technology market going blow within year invest
yay taxi driver peril
long till delamain
feel autonomous transport eventually lead human losing autonomy u already require vehicle live life able afford vehicle already suffer loss autonomy real conundrum fleet autonomous vehicle ppl buy thru service eliminating need vehicle still requiring fee present huge disruption sort way always tradeoff end autonomous vehicle inevitable thinking mean way beyond safety factor
crash starting made go wince hope lived recovered looked brutal
thank
im impression waymo able accomplish area operation vehicle mapped least partially manually software manage condition im really excited im still one people think itll take year available area come save lot life
trust tech piece metal anyone even good alert cuz nothing perfect
yes likely safer however im willing give human experience driving worth risk
american anything avoid public transport
imagine gross disgusting public car would become covered old chewing gum graffiti
somebody take car learned reprogram ai beamng drive lol
lol good idea
cool know else would free road reduce need parking lot car real estate better public transit lol
manual driving outlawed year large part public road
shoutout tesla pure vision crew
time autonomous vehicle data sensor thats also reason moral dilemma would happen vehicle road autonomous state one could implement communication car car internally prediction car front going well likely path car front say going follow would interesting implication say accident vehicle behind crashing car send unexpected path performing emergency break due fact car communicating isnt going series emergency break move behind accident softer car decelerate car behind could automatically create lane first responder possible also eliminate congestion
making common mean changing whole infrastructure around road well example many board sign luminous sign simple car understand
well thing one really worried come driverless car ought safety important thing uncomfortable car first price sold mean better safety wealthier people around new source inequality really dont need dont wan na drive take bus driverless bus huh sure reduce traffic occupancy rate today car already quite low people car average driverless car arrive market may even drop imagine people possibility send car anywhere whim didnt plan ahead use like oh took car morning whatever reason partner need get back work let send one inside since need anyone ride wed end bunch unused car road mess finally environmental impact technology electronic device car need work costly resource afford put everywhere moreover pollution produced driving mean actually need remove car traffic halt climate change stuff plus mentioned technology deployed whole world infrastructure needed maintenance cost imply another cause imbalance developed country others exploit lot get resource car made btw really many ethical political matter need prioritized apart knowing whether car hit baby nun whatever dont mean killjoy matter could make excellent subject video think think take step commercializing driverless car
something could average average people far average line higher line saying case driving good driving subjective people care traffic running smoothly defensive driving much important
congestion autonomous car still congestion feel like critical note sufficiently touched upon video sure driverless car great also think society want like said human unintuitively bad making decision based intuition let therefore assume driverless car solution problem
dont like sponsorship way isnt title top description broadly clearly announced start video
id love hangout backseat
fact people like driving understand big city fear automation r removing simple pleasure life
pedestrian running stationary vehicle yeah really hope part humanity
bad note car detect people speeding take pic reg number u get fine u replace every car one dy government create new virus keep population growth even
think problem technology human driver autonomous vehicle driverless car follow rule human might accident occur rider would worrying driver drive like sharp turn unexpected speeding slow better every car earth autonomous even face traffic problem work efficiently
driver break checking incoming speeding car behind waymo car react
im waiting hard show road im happy see good perform live poland give year usa xdd
live central canada large portion year road significant ice patch someone stupid enough bring selfdriving car even midnorthern state people gon na die lot
delamain early form
nitpicking symantics one thats common day day nitpick good driver formula driver crash time bad driver pu go accident record im bad driver go b ability maveuer vehicle killfully think im good honest accodents blind spot someone exiting patking spot snanning parking spot exiting road parked car self driving way go racing around race track guess new market id guess gokarts etc market looking good
one vehicle make mistake every learn need repeat
often fantasize car driving around getting work done sleeping would absolutely love talk reducing traffic eliminating parking lot talking driverless car becoming public taxi even global pandemic people worry car sick spreading virus vomit diarrhea leave something dangerous behind maybe tracker recorder bomb commonly person slob gym forget impact low income homeless people car end replacing public transit
decade going illegal drive car thats good thing
one welcome machine overlord least longer pretend naive egalitarianism true
software trained urban driving would vehicle exurbanrural environment road usually serious disrepair
make legally safe imagine legal risk computer make decision company always getting blame
spent whole video thinking fake idea existed
laugh uk impossible comprehend driving situation even human
self driving car wont implemented uk road updated wonder put hand thank people let narrow road lol
wonder system driving wrong ehh left side road
thats thing human robot learns task thats repeat error
dystopiawithoutneons understand wonder whether need know driving different side allowed need another billion training mile train driving left
kellogg flake video someone testing self driving uk people park right street lot curb straight street confuses ai doesnt know car stalled waiting someone pas broken car end sitting waiting car move lol
amazing
amazing many people still argue think ab breaking bad pump break better lolcrazy people
argument prove autonomous agent better weak elevator airplane operate strict set parameter entire environment built assumption operate autonomously elevator multiple emergency hardware also built much higher safety margin dont elevator change hoistways plane without set required navigation safety hardware least two redundancy allowed go higher specific height route constantly watched atc personnel deviation serious violator license revoked smallest deviation intended operation also logged pilot checked majority safety elevator airplane result autonomous system policy allow autonomous system operate well defined environment counter asiana airline incident also turkish airline flight autonomous computer decision based broken radio altimeter crashed airplane equivalent road would rebuilding road entirely equipping car proactive hardware implementing strict license requirement effectively making driving hard obtain privilege done western europe obtaining license really hard expensive strict yearly check car street violation subject escalating system license taken away permanently cause many violation usa vehicle related fatality rate k germany k population cheapest safest solution human transportation land good public transportation automated pretty easily push human fatality quite bit think autonomous car future especially implementing policy make road safer problem social technical requires social solution
although make good point example turkish airline flight weak technology advanced lot since
also think solution social technical technology one main cause distraction phone becoming addictive technology increase applying social solution wont enough stop driver getting distracted
sheldorthedestoryer flight number incident happened airline technology change slow expensive subject many regulation many airport styill use il system technology source addiction people distracted driving dont enough negative feedback discouraging license revoked getting geometrically increasing fine discourage also building cheap public transport system make lot people happy dont want drive also make road smarter eg magnetic breaking overspeeding
dystopia disney walle head machine everything human literally nothing left piece warm meat wonder possibility technology might actually harm humanity actually breed disability starting harmlessly smartphones bind couch thermomixes cook videogames adapt always win car think get b development specie similar astronaut quickly loosing ability walk soon dying degeneration
rarely seen video talked much nonsense one shouldnt let wishful thinking driverless car could get way proper evaluation technology phoenix arizona ridiculously skewed test location term weather visibility
right biggest obstacle technology isstupid human driver terrible habit
waymo sponsor episode molly burke
cant imagine driverless car colombia would happy
two problem rarely addressed liability assumption trolley problem solved
multiple insurance company said human liable fully automatic car trolley roblem cant solved dosent definitive solution
anawilliams someone still get injured dy though responsibility handled circumstance individual sacrificed point trolley problem outcome undesirable issue still need justification company car chose one
im terrible driver human year driving found tired distracted could caused accident failed avoid accident caused someone else even percent time im perfect driver every three year ill miss something shouldnt next time buy new car want able drive
who turning camera
one day illegal car steering wheel
day karen gon na someone switch self driving function
soon proven want van lay sleep tell go different city every night sleeping wake new adventure new city ev well charge day time cant wait
hopeful prediction one day car right disability elderly
laugh indian road
eliminating human error easy gaining human intuition difficult challenge reason autonomous driving difficult driving involves lot human intuition someone asks thing take care driving wont able answer thing coz many work done subconscious level
love video topic one question come mind ifwhen get point ditching personal car collective group manage commute people going tofrom work get running errand random travel work currently expectrely flexibility leaving specific time overwhelmingly overlap people obviously one major contributing factor rush hour think society travel expectation need change order adopt model average worker get tofrom work
pilot could land plane almost well autopilot theyre using il plane fly around relatively empty sky autonomous car contend ten thousand obstacle typical trip plane waymo hyperaccurate map phoenix doesnt mean selfdriving car ready drive everywhere look tesla autonomy work everywhere yet car still make mistake technology isnt ready yet
future predicted cpg grey human need apply coming terrifying concern aside surprisingly dont much issue driverless car mostly look forward concern start driving effectively subscription service maybe one ride time rather private ownership expect get tesla toyota ford maintain car also probably scifi nerd talking something megacorporations control overtly track every movement doubt google make data open source create competition anyone else need similar sizeable outlay fund compete similar established corporation likely fund project like year return investment google make money knowing everything even
view always autonomous vehicle dont safe safer average driver
would love see car driving test theyll probably pas flawlessly
there police control guy street need help dont know reason need stop
point need convince anyone know le traffic
solution traffic public transport already exist today
prefer drive thank much although heavy traffic id prefer autonomous vehicle
tesla approach v lidar let video next
tesla scam
useri
sheldorthedestoryer got k owner full self driving year ago hasnt delivering
first car even steering wheel dashboard pedal point drive like said later used google isnt driver ready take control needed
derek question anybody else answer know information would much appreciated context waymo able pull siren microphone integrated elon musk said tesla car able thing people talked online people seem confused due absence microphone tesla perimeter vehicle wondering maybe tesla could use ultrasonic sensor capture harmonic partial siren receiver use ai accordingly dont know sensor one two diaphragm transmitter receiver cant seem find information dont know frequency response transducer id assume outside human hearing range due ultrasonic device would possible use receiver transducer ultrasonic sensor capture harmonic partial frequency content siren wont go signal noise ratio sensitivity doppler effect dsp finished first year studying sound science technology university expert tweeted tesla elon obviously get flooded tweet lecturer break dont even know tesla elon would confirm deny due secret maybe
public transport better solution
autonomous vehicle
course owned google
dont worry dont know pilotless plane yet
future autonomous car lidar machine camera vision using lidar basically using car localized area map pre rendered put lidar vehicle location thats local becomes death machine whereas camera vision adapt every location imaginable like tesla us ai
could someone troll av playing fake sirene making pull
thinking
supposed get anywhere time cant blow light speed excessively wheres im important button let car cut someone else get ahead
wonder thought placing opticom reciever car ambulancepolice vehicle make pull without siren
problem isnt people believe autonomous vehicle afraid vehicle driven people case human would want control vehicle rather system even efficient people dont trust build
wait car kill people covid ban car make people walk everywhere
id worried lidar interference multiple car making use lidar data acquisition kind like much adoption could make base concept unreliable
yeah im confused laser two car interfere
didnt see car video probably already tested made work
maybe sharing data one car others interfere signal
wilmeroberg signal sent encoded ensure signal coming back might simple rolling code keep garage door opener opening neighbor garage
assume tune frequency kinda like bluetooth headphone still work crowd headphone might limit though
simple answer solves traffic
said simple mistake would impossible machine make thats absolutely true know better im self driving vehicle computer machinery always error issue always even extremely unlikely never seem happen chance never dont believe yall think
already see people fired basically creating delamain
waymo radar technology work premapped place tesla hand solve vision based autonomy game waymo
million mile victim problem
wish thing ask police people think
parking time
supercommuter drive hr mostly highway highway stopandgo traffic per week would consider high stress job honestly say often stressed driving rather working used commute using corolla purchased prius one two driving factor purchase car adaptive cruise control work mph lane tracingcentering know technically selfdriving hell lot le stressful constantly make microadjustment driving hr per day day week week year
would resist driverless car fully believe technology like feeling driving much give easily
see lot halfempties chat guy would kept humanity stone age given chance
one emp grenade
ill never willingly buy driverless vehicle want control aspect life
never take taxi ride bus plane
apaledot yes course would never make either everyday mean transportation
autonomus car good im waiting fully autonomous surgery weapon
lot taxi driver downvotes
ever heard tesla year literally million car ahead game autonomous vehicle
ever seen one video people inside tesla scary wonky bad driving
lol tesla cant handle highway let alone city street
lift british english elevator operator still existed large hospital china late early despite lift fully automated young child always confused existence wondered always person uniform whose job push floor number button could lift shopping centre never people course job long gone suspect reason patient visitor disadvantaged community especially rural area many people stopped going school still prepubescent child werent fully literate probably never seen lift seeking healthcare didnt know use especially considering hospital always lift didnt stop every floor eg stopped floor even number people idea even number illiteracy rare china migrant worker bring knowledge urban life back rural area need lift operator hospital still limit floor lift stop thats modern hospital building mini skyscraper
wonder long go fully autonomous cool im old man might able say back day drive car grandkids great grandkids like really
feel like derek bit mad talking mistake human driver made
sitting researching fact like provoke emotional response sure
cant wait happen im optometrist see far many people drive office without correction definitely belet alone amount people driving dense cataract advanced glaucoma macular degenerationgo get eye checked people
one thing never understand ethic question car hit b car literally brake doesnt hit either like car literally stop break
somehow look like teletubbies car siren top lol
driverless car getting better better put rail gon na perfect
oof know sponsored video better public transport infrastructurecity planning didnt revolve around car im general would much impactful point also ai technology good data feed skeptical working scale infra boston rough sometimes line worn road pothole everywhere constant construction mention abundance unpredictable driver wish put kind effort rethinking make city walkablebikeableand access public transport mpre available equitable
anton know day going meeting board need new version tech demo problem mike ill send car bingo bango send car car arrives software problem solved bonus car work take liberty plugging hour top battery
send car laptop like hold tech demo instead pushing git company different problem driverless car yes get point definitely another plus
could send software sort network wire instead sending car
result would massively increased congestion carbon emission air pollution probably also accident
falsum carbon emission eliminated car become electric accident eliminated since car order magnitude safer human driver congestion eliminated car choose appropriate route human would
vehicle electronics amazingly reliable say amazingly car mostly outside day night rain shine hot cold time fail sometimes randomly unexpectedly van wheel sensor stop working couple month suddenly started working think thats scariest autonomous vehicle relying nothing go wrong electronics equipment van made last year type environment normal car endure
always going year away expensive people future would probably find fun drive really think know chore awhile thing every day
dhaka capital bangladesh dont see coming year
yeah wrong action car take human driver would realise person wasnt cross mean doesnt disqualify autocar want proof autocar viable actual demonstration would field testing people selling product
cant believe people actually think tech year away swear people live rock come tech
trust driverless car every car also driverless road
reason said would close year technology whilst almost term practicality almost nonexistent area world technology doesnt need year get better need year introduced widely
dont like future one main reason ether autonomous e vehicle new car general listening music market sound quality system oem stereo opinion terrible even changing speaker isnt good enough factory system electronics weak anemic bass roll save crappy factoryoem speaker time get listen music way like listen get taken away ill one angry mf going back forth work home mile round trip also dont like new car integrated system radio infotainment system loos customizability cant change something better also know people dont care happy ever come airwave transistor radio care care lot
pedestrian bus train etc
main problem monopoly full driver le paradise mentioned video would probably work one company controlled everything
pedestrian crashing stationary car imagine moving expected keep moving car stopped thinking would walk car
rise self driving car provides excellent opportunity change move opportunity massively reduce individual vehicle road opportunity create massive efficient public transport network unfortunately dont think going happen people dont see bus future corporate greed make sure stay way
phoenix good test bed grid city well maintained roadway traffic control want see navigate boston san francisco
limit car speed limit install lane assist intuitive cruise control collision avoidance keep driver want pilot plane give u tool avoid crash could save life year toyota standard rest
society dont really care driverless car whats ecological economic cost mainly driverless car road car everyone already pipe dream world energy nightmare give train everywhere safer efficient faster high speed train
unemployment would cause would argue could solved basic income since driving relatively well paid job truck driver least wage average would cause least massive increase inequality something already seen least issue discussed argue favor labor saving technology
derek somehow edit selfie stick shot cameraman awkward arm next level james bond invisible selfie stick
newer go pro internal software edits stick
texturebacon ahh gotcha thanks reply
lidarvisual mapping system perform rainy condition
well think yes driverless car safer better driving human enjoy driving im car guy noise much nicer dont like driverless car
sorry dont buy least yet anyway tldr car requires massive improvement infrastructure first people need understand car work well thousand man hour gone mapping particular suburb phoenix literally thousand catch town planner dont sit back foot say job done constantly make change road sidewalk bicycle lane etc warrant continuous mapping operating area video give u impression operates entirely many sensor impressive laser technology well half story secondly infrastructure requirement damn high insert meme delightfully honest video asked guess implemented make careful guess year city try imagine many percent american road system yet laboriously manually mapped continually let self driving car go free seems created far onecar locomotive drive eyewateringly expensive railroad track need constant upkeep maintenance seen video entrenches belief many year away actual self driving car concede self driving matter definition arguably car video may qualify somewhat slapdash definition chairman pedantics association must protest car falling even lenient interpretation making expensive extremely expensive infrastructure accommodate capability car instead making car operate given infrastructure backwards way thinking sold selfdriving car getting huge invoice extremely expensive infrastructure erodes concept actual self driving car
passing stale red stop light mph oddly specific
wish driverless commonly available
impressive driver profession seems quite good concern feeling control vehicle relate communication feel safe telling automated driver something stop something dont want elevator press stop button cancel action taking get tell taxi driver pull need get avoid street personal reason alleviate passenger concern issue could hold back seems technology already communication exposure mass thats left making economical
job
""
thumbnail shoe uk background video show self driving car driving u
sick video cant help feeling sad like driving car amazing believe fantastic feeling freedom first learn drive understand essentially irrational argument speaking purely emotional stance definitely part owningdriving car missed shame
understand comparison autonomous car plane flown computer id like point technology limitation mention pilot constantly monitor doublecheck autopilot ready take manual control anytime furthermore think accident driverless car much smaller magnitude airplane plus airport use several system aid landing broadcasted plus known flight pilot enter information flight computer contrast driverless car scan environment ass go big difference etc short think best comparision respect
drive time cool especially long trip im confident wont allowed drive manually technology good enough surpasses ability safety going drive pretty cathartic dont think
uncritical advertisement bad content
government censor speech social medium phone company imagibe control car drive
waymo sponsored video tho
manage traffic light
fhuckkkk
one chip overheats get hackedand realizehow made fool
disregard employment nice
camera point failure
p r v c
like uber go option
basically extended advert waymo shame mean accept sponsorship keep editorial independence derek
video basically advertising campaign waymo quite biased
agreed especially important topic
dont want driveless car want driveless compatible manual driving car driving licence still thing
annesexvlog go channel ok
ride alone supposed ask many ride complete day
like whole vehicle service concept company thats known abuse data marketing running idk cant wait tech accessible competition space bc google already know much lol
thing worry driverless vehicle culpability small chance accident like going fault waymo vehicle hit someone worker ceo software engineer person riding vehicle
death car last year covid say forbid car city use public transportation
dilemma driverless car hit always seemed like philosophical exercise ethic real practical solution real problem say there value sort discussion tell u lot society culture engineering problem
also completely ignores current batch driverless car doesnt use rulebased system machine learning basically cant influence level anyway
yes although connected engineering rd especially new product unforeseeable uncertain consequence still need relatively safe idea concept safety relates certain product get messy due contextual factor result ethicist help engineer navigate complex scenario make smart design decision question might philosophical answer usually aspect technology implemented introduced
india autonomous car used major highway city otherwise many problem autonomous car future india pretty far hope change soon
problem ive waymo car tempephoenix theyll see school zone speed limit sign slow mpheven school session im pretty excited driverless car future
sweden speed linit around school always kmh mph time day day week matter
amazing make wonder every car replaced system would vast majority end traffic jam would prefer system behind wheel majority american driver system doesnt question traffic law obeys human dont even
want driverless car road go place government want go governmentapproved road governmentapproved timeslots
nothing critical could said ended seeming like big advert
derek surely realise conflict interest video great basically worthless educational content really enjoy work usually im disappointed one everything say could true wouldnt matter youve rended untrustworthy
yep praise criticism minute advert
autonomous vehicle road safer road particularly true cargo vehicle u daily death rate high among highly developed country death per dayl
woa great video im proselfdriving car watching came mind concern like vulnerable could potential cyberattack emergency button enough also see lidar problem night extreme weather dirty sensor camera cant wait know kind technology definitely give u hope better future
know video sponsored let make one thing clear someone netherlands infrastructure far important automation yes people still die car accident infrastructure far better amount people killed traffic accident almost completely negligible compared u arent going fix traffic automating going fix improving infrastructure oh course benefit better infrastructure also make easier selfdriving car function sponsor fully support fight better infrastructure decrease cost increase amount potential customer
wait minute car isnt driverless there robot driving
good point
right unsupervised car
butdriving kind fun
tabaco company published tone study data showing product safe
irrelevant tobacco short term effect people dont realize gravity hand car short term negative effect everyone realize
thought like impede progress sure youre technically correct cant admit machine always better reaction time human youre lying still accident im sure frequency would go dramatically crash wouldnt even matter
impaler purdue pharma published lot marketing material claiming product oxycontin non addictive taken recommended doctor quick believe multi billion dollar company telling would impeded progress
jac relevant believe anything multi billion dollar company say weather phillip morris google company repeat statement safety self driving car made manufacture need independently verified believe
biggest concern isnt technology vehicle technology security come system vehicle really think see majority swap make autonomy majority slow rollout nearly every car page pretty solid
company payed talk good necessary product wont believe happened next look someone work ai automation dont care good car driving area little traffic well marked care extreme case like there lot confusing traffic ambiguouscontradictory road signal happens lot many case specially outside rich area world using statistic make point terrible people driving make zero sense dont compare current selfdriving system similar circumstance statistic current autonomous system environment general trend hide ton information real failure might way autonomous driving last thats challenging part given already overestimated progress past wont least year
even ai car hard time would worse human driver know derek person lie stuff quick cashgrab
hacker safety
interesting progression
youve done video sponsored waymo would interesting investigate compare autonomous driving vehicle implemented technology achieve autonomous driving also autonomous vehicle impact job throughout world
poland driver idiot
selfdriving car would become reality mayorly replace human droven car worldwide next year would really pissed spend get driver license
car hacked
yes
video trying take shot tesla fails explain waymo isnt deploying scalable solution google literally premapping route car take drop waymo onto street never seen cant operate intent video good waymo sponsorship really caused misleading tesla visiononly system way go literally drive street never seen every tesla road act data collector sends data back tesla train network waymo collected mile real world driving tesla collected billion data key solving autonomous driving waymo actually nowhere close solving video tesla crashing highway software thats since updated pace innovation exponentially increasing tesla year away robotaxis likely going waymo
keep telling musk karpathy quite bit deliver promise waymo actually fully autonomous car unlike tesla geomapping city long process think zoox day tesla vision heap problem close lvl
ascarez geomapping scalable solution cant hop waymo ask take san diego escondido tesla beta v leap ahead beta v leap ahead waymo today debate tesla already race
great great lidar one work great car like work interfere sure ju like multiple wifi hot spot multiple channel fix possible change time stationary wifi move mix othere car channel chosen many car better solution additional crowd control system nearest one range lidar
car hacking happened easily happen example influence easily countered year old remote controlling car state away
cant help feel scared get car like know way safer way travel future really cant wait thing go global
cant wait
make sure everyone instagram known product get money app cost
prank driverless car siren noise unless sophisticated
want see big city
way see lot people driving today would much rather prefer driverless car plus wouldnt much road rage
would need option manual driving though sometimes even often people drive pleasure like lowlevel activity driving vehicle nice landscape whatever roadtrips passive passenger could get boring
keep hearing trying coax safe wonderful honesty really wonder car future rely radar lidar cause cancer
radar lidar cause cancer use nonionizing radiation mean warm incredibly small amount
drabberfrog awesome thanks
human care control security efficiency
doesnt technology put normal car assist human driver
tesla
ok
waymo wrong foot going path lidar dependancy lidar make waymo good specific neighbourhood reason outside phoenix arizona waymo taxi common knowledge waymo technology fundamental deficiency yet vertasium like scientific minded channel presenter singing praise waymo make want remind vertasium episode waymo promo advert
waymo car electric
honestly love idea drive relax commute still year year country ready due road driver behavior dangerous youre european drive bekasi indonesia im sure youd degree shockedterrified road lol
missed going cyber security thing definitely hackable
fewer accident instead driving productive software able predict allow car flow without traffic stop would want self driving car
one question since every single job requires thing manual relatively easy becoming automated mean job survive future rd
wouldnt say quality road problem many country instead legal question responsibility system decide extreme situation damage something hurt someone lesser accident total passenger responsible car manufacturer software programmer
something kahneman et al really try emphasise latest book noise human judgment full noise lot bad necessarily easily visible consequence machine dont noise given input machine output result every time whereas human often dont cant wait selfdriving car become mainstream would save many life would also save whole population lot time
trust enjoy driving much willing change yet
fact february many selfdriving car crashed wired depends interpret question based source weve mentioned could said serious crash including fatality hand total number crash collision u must much higher consider rearend crash california alone mind data autonomous vehicle accident indicates collision crash arent uncommon selfdriving car safer government technology moment selfdriving car higher rate accident compared humandriven car injury le serious average selfdriving car accident per million mile driven rate crash per million mile regular vehicle selfdriving car statistic indicate pedestrian behavior one software greatest challenge ar technica meanwhile human driver predict certainty whether pedestrian sidewalk cross street especially outside pedestrian crossing fact female respondent claim would feel safe crossing street autonomous vehicle road contrary men could say may selfdriving system software still long way go ubers selfdriving car software may recognize people unimportant obstacle regarding ubers av killing pedestrian extreme tech short happened arizona incident may followed even selfdriving car accident car software algorithm interpreted woman false positivean object ignored much like windblown plastic bag year uber received billion continue research improve car safety guardian company got new funding mostly toyota saudi arabia
lol let see thing handle rain snow low visibility mall traffic kid shining flashlight cross street unexpectedly middle road midnight pothole
believe much easier adopted utilize taxi service im taxi used elderly vehicle shop weird driver know communicate
wont excited cornered paying subscription able access different area city
youve changed mind change mind
perfect car low testosterone soyboys jump taxi better
lonely human driven autonomous taxi hour expensive lost time future time communication
well gon na work india ever

human driver suck suck want driverless car sooner rather later ive seen many story vehicle automation making bad decision incorrectly interpreting surroundings ready hop one right maintaining lane driving road night rain lane marker removed part maintenance construction project difficult computer better maybe assuming data road uptodate maybe driving keep eye vehicle exhibiting subtle sign driver potentially influence distracted otherwise unsafe many many signal cue contextdependent see sign vehicle potentially unsafe around put vehicle somewhere vehicle le likely cause problem doubt technology reached point match performance regard
grandchild say grandpa true u drove car back day
cant wait tell grandkids used taxi driver
issue driverless car fact nobody driver seat fact youll likely minority everyone else human driving manually mean crash u terrible driving blame driverless car rather fault situation fault human driver people driverless car driverless car company seems like lengthy expensive court case try find fault dont even get started someone dy robotcomputer go prison held accountable person murder company people driverless car get point people back seat cant held responsible car back seat
cant even get people vaccinate good luck convincing people give driving
dont blame dont report bad vaccine doesdont believe everything news feed
cool one question though said every ride currently monitored human would billion car road easier small team monitoring ride would level safety achieved billion car
great amazing disabled people drive reduce traffic good public transit making city town walkable reduce traffic
here simple fact change automated car even today would probably remove least fataltys road
reduce congestion
prove
justinl proof shown fataltys caused driver error already add fact automated car react quicker nondriver error blown tire example fact save life top one based driver error get point death car accident basically nothing
nope nope nope nope ill drive thank ive driving professionally truck driver year year pizza delivery driver accident free yes average called paying attention hard people make look hard
driverless vehicle capable matching racing driver decade problem work optimal condition magnetic trail could help lot guiding trail anywhere
ive yet see footage selfdriving car singlelane unpaved forest road
road safer looking forward
fun selfdriving car im never going relinquish ability drive love driving also come plane flying also ton time pilot taken terrible situation landed safely accounting variable ai couldnt yet handle
want sam want road would want toad
wont work place poorly maintained road people dont stay lane could said australia derek also according volvo kangaroo problem
forgot unconsciously driven emotion inherited hairy ancestor almost hairy traffic situation life cyclist fell category dumb acting due bad emotion thats advantage machine imho hope inadvertently inject ai biased training data something
whilst think technology incredible honest defied expectation little bit still think important realize still car centric approach solving get around efficiently believe selfdriving car serve important role easing congestion solving parking problem major city making transportation accessible also think important however build city easily accessible mean transportation public transport cycling walking everyone get place selfdriving car would still need massive road spend lot energy powering car making environment le welcoming people selfdriving pod hope get le cardependent society
totally agree idea sentiment think one thing think current infrastructure self driving car seamlessly integrate
love idea self driving car love idea everyone riding self driving train bused around even
cant wait self driving bus train tram etc super smooth
yeah fully automated public transport system dynamically adjust business many comprehensive line connect almost area densely populated area work conjunction self driving car take people sparsely populated area
nice sentiment order make public transit conviennent effective including cost effective requires certain population density actually rather high also people destination also relatively high density want go enough people want go substantial negative impact facilitating proper fulfilling enriching recreation think would sad state affair personal level good society social level divide society separate people farming industry support high density lifestyle recent yellow vest protest france violent disruptive beginning example political economic issue devolve large dominating high density transitintegrated city paris reality rural industrial life
technology part said infrastructure isnt scratch
probably wont ever scratch state infrastructure nationwide godawful continue next half century worsening rate faster capable fixing
dedompler exact situation uk
youre right think would comfortable could hear blinker always good know intent even passenger car human driver
upside mucho denero big company shareholder downside million people worldwide lose job probably going create new big depression
holy reach bucko
ive saying couple year everyone lol
driving elevator sound le fun driving car make sense replaced however think people especially men enjoy car enjoy driving much imagine autonomous vehicle also add significantly new vehicle price moving part fail anyone else think lidar sound quite loud
dont think kid hearing car sound like super hot weather ac running second fan hood car ac smaller spin ac smaller louder hotter get faster spin louder get
hey interesting glimpse infrastructure behind waymos driverless vehicle youve made much talk human driving vehicle okay interesting actually im immediately interested fact three team people required operate vehicle presumably arizona fact vehicle driver mean human judgement involved outsourced case single corporation three team least working see letys team others make decision dispatch vehicle handle customer service presume presumably take event failure thats id like know many vehicle three team handle many hour work day week get benefit guarantee trained continue trained qualified work theyll shepherding fleet vehicle solution scale problem million vehicle united state replaced autonomous vehicle many team talking happens make mistake abuse position youve made big talk accident united state caused human error technology waymo drastically reduce maybe id reframe argument point widespread adoption driverless vehicle mean youre placing responsibility reducing six million accident year united state commercial entity presumably deep pocket ability dictate itll engage legal system event something going wrong point ie amount accident attributed human error six million accident ie percentage accident least one human fatality least dead people whats order magnitude company like waymo guaranteeing theyll reduce talking reducing death thousand time death year sound great unless youre one family affected death also another thing comfort regard individual citizen held accountable poor driving subject individual citizen criminal charge would like point united state government still charged head company responsible million american death example purdue pharma guarantee waymo mess american able hold accountable happens technology go global nonamericans hold american company accountable death cant even get head american corporation testify even played role genocide want take control landbased vehicle
cant wait ive sick driving many year especially long commute city driving way stressful id much rather let car work relax
taxi optional mode sound good option definitely choosing saving people growing billion population losing option drive would easy choice
agree anonymous car road loop hole people still drive manually controlled car
well live cyberpunk yes
youre going first drive keep going hell
good video fact sponsored waymo huge flaw way seen advertising personally fully agree message skeptical people react negatively
k dislike people neural network change future sure
yeah thats still ba hard pas
trolley problem logic stupid read article little back driverless car wont ever thing wont able decide either staying pas hitting someone crosswalk swerving onto sidewalk hit group people like thing see hundred meter away nothing else socalled mind driving would going fast enough make last second split second decision instead proactively bringing speed manageably brakeable speed reporter worried car stupid safe like asking neanderthal comment feasibility aircraft
real sad thing lot solution driverless car achieve would actually achieved better city incorporate better public transport system
wake drive shitty road drive road marking stop sign covered tree sign misaligned merging done traffic passing driver signaling noddinggesturing severe car crash done first week driving cautious driving using law taught made unpredictable experienced driver frantic densely populated city city account majority population country technology wont affecting current decade
actually ive wanting driverless car year
mostly wonder easily translates citiescountries assuming decent infrastructure would require million billion hour driving experience long take get phoenix year year week point even put different city country long system need deemed safe public scaling private company seems like go want default transportation need massive capitol buy everything sure bezos zuckerberg put dent world wide also video car seems gasoline car green would guess putting setup electric car drain lot power battery reducing range lifespan would issue solved guess wireless charging road get another infrastructure issue anyway idea nice seem end defnitely want self driving car future
rich time money nothing create solution problem dont exist steal time money driverless car going nothing take away essential entry level job lot people might take away truck driver well
part really stupid solution problem right called public transport
make impressed waymo though unnessesary sensor data processed made think elegance tesla approach waymo criples overengineering granting themselfes time work slows whole process make cost waymore cost hardware never low enough really scale significantly ordinary camera cost hardly anything
talking friend year future look like mainly hate driving meaning get b waste time would like know fast go perform bad weather cause heavy rain current car sensor say cant see anything waymo comming europe need test car gim call
would continue investing individual traffic solution every single one issue transformation human automated control vehicle face found within public transportation really liked video basic direction hint solving fundamental issue growing traffic face
self driving misnomer vehicle driven programmer programming team wrote software trust vehicle driver present driver car skin game absent programmer wrecked oh well there bug
think still elevator driver part india guess theyre called elevator operatorattendants rare see elevator operatorattendant elevator college attendant think ive seen metro station theyre rare theyre dont know maybe limited city lol idk
lidar v camera anyone tesla folk going believe autonomous car equal
dont think valid compare year driving computer compared year driving human human excel stuff learn year computer could year least stand right
seperate lane autonomous car would
thought problem mainly legal economical driver get accident liable autonomous vehicle get accident manufacturer would liable bigger risk manufacturer
human shouldnt input different scenario car learn minimal hardware thus cheaperlike tesla
long overdue future chuckle reluctant slow get broad use much like chuckle elevator driver
start driverless public transport seriously many city would love adapt thing lower cost
problem bus driver lot job besides drive bus theyre cashier security guard first responder baggage handler helper disabled people
hugely important muskstyle individualist solipsism really waste also public transit there private capital incentivised hike price cut corner make profitable expense everyonr
falsum could still thing like chauffeur bus would still safer use driverless version fact could perform duty better wouldnt need focus driving
usmansiddiqui perhaps wouldnt exactly lower cost case though

interesting topic also interested driverless public transport taking trip pilot driverless bus commuting experience incomparably better manuallydriven one ride smooth bus small electric low center gravity making ride almost smooth train tram put lot road due pay driver salary increasing frequency driverless vehicle transform commuting chore enjoyable experience hope spread population bit evenly reduce housing price living close work city center loose lot appeal
also think cyclist get infinitely annoying know car wont hit
bruh im ready accept robot master
yeah didnt address trolley problem dismissed tut tut silly human cant wait issue unpredictable stupid bad driver get car first
issue unlikely type scenario doesnt mean waved away outcome trolley problem still involves injury death taken lightly especially large corporation involved
cyclist hit waymo car behind kid front car elderly right side car cliff left side car waymo car kernel panic
dont think really unlikely
inevitable easier car autonomous
see thats thing im really wondering car around eventually im sure people get relatively comfortable even currently know theyre probably better still wouldnt even consider getting one eventually im sure many others able rewire enough accept point though interesting part hard time ever envisioning willingly car didnt least option manually driving would almost matter outlawing manual driving vaccinelike situation regard selfdriving stuff feel like might even tricky get people board since feel like matter personal responsibility may next big hurdle society need get increasingly technology data play number game large scale sort cultural concept individual independent selfresponsible agent might go since weve built much world idea id imagine thats going tricky get people
car problem even autonomous car network car bad transportation tonne metal plastic per around people ridiculous average subway transport people car require large unwalkable infrastructure like intersection highway dont contribute anything else society take space
wonder car would handle europe american suburb
try driverless car winter
im favour time enjoy driving option go drive
hopefully definitely illegal point
title want driverless car road video sponsored waymo imagine
multiple autonomous vehicle would another level complexity
would like see development experience northern older city challenging road traffic weather condition
technology pretty scary opportunity simple supply demand like nearly billion people significant chunk developing world asia may slowing growth rate africa projected boom next several decade automation going put hundred million people job whatever future may hope profit dont come people economy either protect job compete aiautomation economy drastically reimagined anticipation
tech work high tech area perfect condition ill interested drive live country harsh winter northern state also mentioning anything moral decision autonomous vehicle always stop pedestrian road well criminal standing front vehicle robbed killed ai able make decision foreseeable future

selfdriving car mean people unable learn drive gon na disaster
ride horse road thats illegal drive car road thats illegal going outside irl thats illegal
imagine could chuck kid car set route school wait bit see whip pull hour later would go pick
know put bus
netherlands different system enables kid go school called bike
dalstein country also small heck xd
flymoore every american life rural area nobody life near school
felixnzlq fair enough still cool
people dont stay lane country tf think driving law country
look india
say video sponsored waymo advertisement waymo objective research even scalable since waymo us geofenced area simulation train net im sorry real world way messier human come simulation clearly sell waymo trying pas video true depth analysis simply trying make buck waymo
supposed educational channel quite bit shoddy argumentation equivocation video obvious bias frustrating easily overlooked especially amount excitement shown type product
aviation comparison complete falseequivalence partly equivalent level well level required car pilot incredibly welltrained automation doesnt use properly aircraft automation also doesnt make decision pilot input specific flight path follow stage
yeah hate people compare autopilot selfdriving car two completely different goal autopilot exactly pilot told selfdriving car make countless decision constantly
script much
sooner get majority driverless vehicle sooner rid traffic jam driverless vehicle communicate one another extremely quickly g addition system used confirmation lidar radar camera etc vehicle communicated lane change proceeding like everyone always using blinker tapped brake pressing aggressively would reduce crash also permit vehicle driving much close one another thus permitting vehicle roadway time mph suggested car length space could cut much majority driverless vehicle point mechanic physic thinking would nearly instantaneous
driverless car solve traffic though
technology cool lot wow neato factor get though human part perfectly capable safely operating vehicle somehow want technology save u somewhere mix notion personal responsibility fallen wayside thought circle r word responsibility taboo instead correcting behavior look tech compensate shortcoming waste human potential human mind potential capability almost endless since hard think anything beyond immediate want desire take tech approach solving apparent problem weird sad
try tesla billion real mile tested
tesla autopilot good ive seen video dumb thing usually hit car pedestrian thing like slowing mph turn highway tesla autopilot far behind car video
car handle situation making emergency stop word autonomous description
yeah tesla really shouldnt market autopilot way
id agree human driver cause majority accident statistic self driving car misleading tested ideal circumstance parameter like weather road marking behavior participant simply always ideal self driving car basically need stop reduce speed le ideal situation stopping whole show reason human driver would easily get around taking risk responsibility mean self driving car traffic together human driver might worse none percent argument plane landing automatically ignores airport basically guide plane via determined glide path automated landing provision road traffic yet check vehicle vehicle communication similar also plane redundancy built hence extensive selfdiagnosis capability thing simply find car car would cost much lot le efficient weight purpose automation safest mode car defect stop thats something plane cant safely fact come top head point different approach problem industry argument dont survive conversion concept
agree decision selfdriving car make usually inherently bad example usually hit car pedestrian often fail theyre complex situation get confused cause accident combination driver expecting human something like cause accident comparison autopilot plane use completely invalid autopilot make actual decision exactly programmed pilot one making decision negotiating atc
everybody gangsta vehicle reject destination youve selected
would love see car drive new york city manhattan believe think road autonomous car work road like broadway feel might ready yet
million mile public road many canadian northern u etc winter article challenge snow build sensor road markingssigns confusing ai slippery road condition etc im hoping focus done releasing region lot snow imagine exposed spinning lidar sensor first thing fail need exposed like hopefully good solution come
snow buildup road sign would equally confusing human sensor broke think car told drive slippery road surface car use ai spin dont think youre one correcting called traction control modern car use
watched minute commercial love
road full car wont lidar reflection start influence encode personal reflection
interesting question guess may use slightly different frequency
im wondering average person could afford car like
average person throughout history went able afford meat month owning tiny machine information world allow talk people around world
wont big tech research going ride service user owned car
wrap giant suit bubble wrap wear helmet everywhere go important thing safety autonomy one slippery slope world piloted car everyone go scripted go scripted safe encourage driver education school encourage teaching people think think nurture common sense sensible behaviour place friggin dystopia becoming worse every day
quite sure supposed work taxi pay cant handicapped people ie call taxi supposedly one fix traffic congestion need parking lot
comma ai open pilot good enough
believe comparison plane fair car interact many human plane separated
would problem driverless car would luxury maintain hundred meter separation everyone else moving road
put black doll driver seat wait blow cop mind
cant wait taxi become driverless
imagine firefly would thinking indian road
would nightmare sure lol
yes safer human driver much mileage single person didnt address uncertainty possibly dangerous behavior encounter new situation seen im referring traffic cone incident uploaded youtuber take waymo lot
got ta ask whats camera he using
making car usage cheaper major downside public transport cycling suffer
hate driving would good fully relax car
get tesla full self driving two week
im sure id ever able fully relax self driving car year least
paulsjdb id never able relax hacker surely get cracking wouldnt even able relax outside
wyattb tesla fsd beta even level system definitely wont relaxing
jadakiss tesla billion mile autopilot april theyve made progress million car fleet need software update enable level autonomy assume ready decade
believe fully autonomous car something aim think yet reason stated video people unlike elevator train plain navigate fully controlled environment car navigate street dumb people dumb unpredictable thing replace car block road pedestrian would probably work almost perfectly thats impractical therell transition hybrid period requires fully autonomous vehicle able perform way better required process done
fundamentally though problem standard self driving car assure safe vendor selfdriving car allowed mark homework good enough company vested financial interest vehicle entity evaluates safety vehicle clear conflict interest therefore need government step create driving test selfdriving vehicle must include adverse driving condition poor lighting poormissing road marking unexpected road work etc etc must include disconnection internet networking might providing information vehicle real time real life vehicle face situation happened pleased see selfdriving car road
see people become easy target mugged robbed happened nearly twice traffic light first time guy opened door floor red light get away second time door locked trying leave car park one stood front car run little get away car going anything want mug someone car someone else stand front car wont run sit still smash window get car stuck sitting unable move car better human regular driving something bad happens going sit left unable anything
video like help provide confidence society ride autonomous vehicle dont think hat far even say year thats still blip expanse time
issue feel would like scene movie irobot cant car autonomously drive fast human drive nothing auto drive car mph way human could drive
think scare even job human
automation always better remember boeing max computer wrestling control pilot
havent watched channel honestly amazing amount sponsorship bias wow pull statistic context amazing crossreference field work absolutly different mechanic technology marvalous keep going hope money worth
next step shilling elons starthingy honestly want meet engeneers code car decide weather hurt owner pedestrian ask feel like play god thanks truely driverless car bad idea object programmed make potentially deadly microdescisions cant subsitute human beeing car cant charge
happens car laser radar becomes common wouldnt laser saturate road make laser system confused id like explanation im curious
shes beautiful
love selfdriving car saw potential path person could take identified one path might cause harm immediately decided stop human dont decide bet likelyhood person isnt going go front one many way fully autonomous vehical umpteen time safer human driver
yeah human driver right behind hell make judgment subconsciously never expect car slam brake moment possibly causing accident think common cause accident go away distraction impairment speed rage etc autonomously driven car new type accident may increase long human driver still majority balance better moving autonomy
screw robot lol
small clarification come plane want flying low visibility bad weather lot gust wind want pilot control
comparing autopiloted plane free sky ai car facing billion challenge constellation danger serious people really talk many independent pro instead believing unconditionally sponsored guy company behind truth real random scenario choosen one presentation like video called ai still make way error driven mile human hard fact folk fantasy cost life thank god many people realize current development still far away competitive human question responsible sueable taken life ai car safe u irresonsible greedy corporation many promise profit mind computer tech nerd come life child etc better develop decade go full risk current momrnt ai earth exchange human dont believe hyped trendy people youtube told otherwise check goal status human brain project serious people
fully autonomous car chaotic world violates turing halting problem self driving car work even human switch brain driving real autonomous car prove turing wrong reason autonomous car exists paris work survives longer hour traffic chaotic environment faster autonomous system fail show car manufacturer world capable let thair car run week without accident running paris london moscow even worst city india want driverless car based instead people like take high risk risk people risk doesnt like take risk statement based data manipulated let autonomous car look great
would like see hacking problem addressed already putting much life safe hand google facebook putting literally life place hacked used kill everything hacked
people want kill already hack brake line common sense term
randomname requires hand job autonomous car offed remotely guy another side planet also much harder track find someone tinkered brake mean killing someone kidnapping mean already car probably paying attention going
one long ad
great vid never thought could change parking lot green space
nobody want talk fact widespread adoption autonomous car take hold slow shift toward forcing people want drive car say everyones safety like mask know insurance company wont insure car manual steering wheel boom mean private transportation public commercial transit brave new world aka total control movement technocracy government power player god dystopian future
funny fail tell vehicle cant drive anywhere geofenced unlike tesla tesla mile driven anywhere america even though level yet tesla supercomputer going allow win autonomous race
could take bus train subway bike anything wouldnt waste fuel produce pollutant single passenger powered transportation mechanism
sale pitch promoting safety people get distracted driving screen reality pushing corporation wanting people distracted screen driving
way engineer report predict percent decrease fatality per annum car automated number probably higher well reduce traffic let enjoy ride idiot hear car travelling fast slow time either hit family thats front swerve wall suppose outcome fatal family rider would car like come
veritasium officially sold he running psyop google big tech company care safety care profit could kill profit would oh wait theyre already
two scenario moral relevant preached church tool used politician geopolitical struggle comapnies caring profit consider mind blown also since value life safety profit winwin
moral always relevant unless youre evil safety irrelevant people even value dont self driving car decide killing maiming always choose kill way cost le company onetime settlement rather lifetime payment system take care bro backwards thinking
year
dont ball get ai driven car call super basic
ride play strength autonomous car merging onto freeway location lot pedestrian area driverless car issued would fine urban taxi area without lot pedestrian dont confidence system freeway place full bike pedestrian
probably wont early adopter im still sold long term reliability automatic transmission
x better like driverless car road communicate also eliminate traffic well
good arizona live canada dont think ready qubec winter
love autonomous driving got learner permit im fun driving haha
dont mind driving given choice id rather spend time watching veritasium video
knock knock who waymo waymo waymo reliable
oh boy potential unknown exploit huge like fake news took storm social medium scary imagine unintended consequence driverless car unleash havent found yet fix fake news
something said thing way mile name company waymo driverless car thats waymo better human coooool
enjoy propaganda fellow human
one thing still resolved autonomous car cause accident whatever reason one blame pay fine go jail passenger owner car manufacturer software engineer programmed faulty collision detection
cant work bangalore
infuriating think driverless car get accident simply idiot ran red light human still better avoiding see even poor driver avoid
bold assumption situation human could avoid assuming driver running red light car avoided incident red light run car avoided paint different picture im saying case ive evidence anymore evidence car cant handle driver running red light
youll never able eliminate need downtime parking lot demand transportation static particularly spike weekday hour worker travel work
im necessarily self driving car fact episode sponsored waymo mean message video cant trusted objective
yeah cool presentation might possible future still sort commercial
good point
demonstrably objective go read report claiming well car yes got significant accident driven distance human would get includes driving night snow rain sleet distracted tired influence driver autonomous car ignores disconnection human watching autonomous car saw potential incident prevented happened time simulation say would crash perform quite well human level replacing human one increase accident rate unquestionably basically drive well tired careful human major collision dont go fast enough plenty accident nonetheless argument saying computer dont make mistake factually wrong computer make mistake programmer make
whether possible whether company like google monopolise lobby market hell hoarding even data every move life camera per car totalitarian regime utopia chinastyle face tracking except ok private business totally tell truth blackboxed system operated behind closed door private company focused profit recently removed dont evil clause gathering street view data live area sooo excited
hit crap ridiculous idea car wont situation first place always crud philosophical question
car doesnt control world driver put car situation fault car
""
thespartan human going time evaluate crud car attempt stop shortest distance simple something human may able nonsense question
formula driverless race ftw
asiana flight tragedy pilot level training american pilot get
assisted driving sound good autonomous vehicle sound dangerous right modern ai programming still able make executive decision moment based nonprescribed condition often people forced bend break rule road safety self driving car drive road save pedestrian try stop straight trajectory may endanger said pedestrian free thought allows comprehensive driving people need electronic chauffeur integrated least degree
oh god waymo crap full stop real autonomous driving come tesla one beat
cant wait driverless car unfortunately living uk still pipe dream road signage roundabout overgrown narrow country lane cyclist pandemic best detection system world couldnt calculate safely government council would start repairing maintaining every city town b road isnt going happen next year
idea autonomous vehicle kill anyone misnomer better wet driver seems cracked save life
fix noise car would interested imagine every car made much noise noise kill
imagine pulled cop first thing tell sir would ask provide driver license
autonomous car dont anything illegal
fair point changing one car automaticallydriving car safer pretty narrow point compared question long term impact thing like city planning fuel emission etc certainly increase usage reliance car cpg grey selfdriving car intersection walkable
bmw cut van would realistic test instead
audidiot
work fine car lidar
far car go go one state another would refueling work
one thing say waymo sheeeeeeeesh
thinking wow would cool place like city he probably across country something say he city rn thats crazy
cursed luddite among u
better question driverless car work requires waymo sized company specialised hardware support particular road condition make public transport better instead invest money make public transport good dont need car anymore free city need car entirely inefficint take lot lot space amount fancy ai fix
driverless car amazing technology functional issue probably legal cultural driver responsible car driving car requires driver license etc automated car require shift legal cultural foundation driving car
cant wait automated car every day walk work pas roundabout everyone behaves different guess everytime car yield crosswalk shouldntautomated car would behave way time dont driving license choice realised road safer without automated car would make consider getting one probably wouldnt since dont need
solution isnt driverless car solution public transportation le car
biggest question happens one sensor go bad dust dose stop road keep going like one eye chicken
idiot add sticker wing modify suspension brake software make move faster le safe
one read get conflict btwn steve moyld electoboomits physic based hefff naaa
may good explaining science far le qualified understand social economic implication please dont promote commercial purpose name science
confirm least driver good driver
like driving lot plus isnt going work lot place snow rain flooding dirt road way automated driving going full force next even year also feel like isnt big problem derick made public transportation better solution environment cost effective fact sponsored waymo also bit red flag optimistic show little criticism thought
highly agree public transport future thought idgaf like drive dont want family dead someone find driverless boring information extrapolate say year already effort intelligence poured driver le getting u moon paper subject publicly available sponsorship red flag though main issue driver le opportunity monopoly going safer maybe year everyone pay subscription service get car company might make car safe driverless car company something
kinda could work city
moved stick get away kind stuff many people old town right outside boston providence want freedom enjoy driving highly suggest moving city dense suburb going change drastically coming year
jac agreed part know there going crazy advance technology next year maybe well find something replace lidar feel like bit problem autonomous car still think going take lot longer video suggests especially hard get place across world people hardly follow rule road
best thing autonomous car car driverless talk would basically chance accident actually happen traffic flow would probably greatly improved
better invest public transport bike lane oslo zero death
useri someone doesnt even driver license year old get everywhere bike public transport think good idea people simply able use bike public transport self driving car could really useful automated public transport would probably also help lot
shame waymo sponsorship particular small footnote citing waymos research back waymo manager quote dont doubt driverless car much safer would use available however going convince sceptic independent research paper might carried weight mind convincing sceptic day seems pretty pointless process
there big difference open critical feedback convincing sceptic video doesnt address issue present way acknowledges significance criticism oriented toward may win perpetualsceptic address genuine concern new technology
cool technology would problem trusting dont agree implication end video automation eventually solve problem private vehicle brought city development model rest need solution often requires strongly reduce private mobility
uh thank
sure good city suburb dont see dirt road intermountain west usa used live maze like dirt ad hoc road path live general santos city philippine even google map get basic point point work completely wrong live couldnt way isnt vehicle arent great great instance house house number street cute literally street path take get across path across donated land onto another path place isnt unique many place driverless car public utility vehicle metro area much like bus city suburb like bus cant go everywhere
phoenix profile cross illdefined path dirt absence vegetation often two meter wide place stream thirty meter wide path coming odd angle fifty meter unmarked pavement congested sort vehicle vehicle unable really go faster kph others far powerful pedestrian general santos pedestrian vehicle jingle need maybe hail thing called tricycle motorized pedicab pedicab well city philippine mostly lot walking walking dirt almost entirely uncontrolled access road eightlane national road may jog center wait traffic allows cross rest way traffic city mix folk afoot tricycle motor bike often cc car pickup van semi together recent past carabao pulled cart still seen farm road lane marking either ignored lefthand drive nation people tend hug center lane pas outside right lane pas coming crest hill visibility people tricycle often seen hugging right side road driving flow traffic traffic light precious may working get even crazier software engineer really think code insanity traffic place like coding industry challenge contact prove say good host place scream uncle leave
machine long range vision meter would human able see pedestrian distance would need drive meteres per second need talk
waymo way experience
two boeing max crash caused autonomous program
million mile data waymo billion tesla gap increasing day day tesla training low cost vision ai system waymo need super expensive lidar brainer going win race
plus waymo still us huge prelabeled information city allowed drive order scale phoenix need manually get accurate information road intersection etc whereas tesla try figure like human driving
teslaafondo exactly case st company achieve fully autonomy take market share anyone understands ai work doubt tesla dominate data like gold
robber cant run away car probably
hmm analogy driverless elevator really applicable ive never heard elevator crashing another elevator intersection rainy evening term fully autonomous clearly abused definition industry
think elevator example really highlight human aversion towards autonomous technology plane example practical application though modern aircraft possible passenger land plane thanks ai need contact someone give instruction set landing
sarahd elevator example mainly example eliminating job japanese averse new technology elevator operator still working japan
waverly kennedi yes course would alos prefer killed glitch tesla driverless system mean musk earns profit rather bogeyman
say need get away something hurry autonomous system arent good commandeering aggressive driving would anyone want getaway vehicle giving much data anyone tracking luddite oh yeah wrote phone
okay got question said plane flying autonomously bad weather condition sensor used precise gps radar data self driving car use lidar user light humanly visible spectrum still light get reflected absorbed certain material eg water car work way getting visual data even wrong visual data rapidly changing lighting condition like tunnel flash light also much computing needed work kind processor autonomous car need laggy car latency data computed
well go watch firefly
yes waymo freaking awesome level certain part united state think though strategy used make hard apply really big part world first map drive autonomously think tesla vision autonomous strategy way universal quickly look fsd beta v yes still thing improve work many type road situation waymo restrict mapped area
basically car anxiety
thing left waymo work everywhere work certain kind road certain level traffic area pre mapped thats see everywhere isnt perfect sub urban city road work
would trust side branched metro system still logical automated like driving one favorite thing either car motorcycle im happy born early able driveride whole life
metro system public transportation feasible everywhere either geological feature small amount population
everyone drive wont getting one car never doge maniac mention ramming another car lot accident
much transportation good public driverless transport city dont require car
think idea form decentralized public transport understand company function ondemand taxi service bus set route think resource efficient dynamic system like reduce traffic dramatically cut idling point dont think idea people would buy car theyd pay ride like bus taxi since driver pay likely cheaper insurance fee also lot le
dont doubt autonomous vehicle arrive maybe ten year maybe two also like idea leaving driving car trip someone enjoys driving fear autonomous car may effectively make driving illegal accident whether fault see prove somehow autonomous car wouldnt able avoid clink clink youre going like idea self driving car dont want lose ability drive result tim
make happy wife talk lot people terrible driver baltimore area autonomous car needed
taxi uber driver protest
autonomous cool use public transportation effectively selfdriving youre passenger move people car taking similar space
happening murica commend japan amsterdam showing public transit wayy better car country soon try adapt public transit system
amazing tech cant wait common
build city one need car amsterdam cough honestly feel like car dependent wasteful sprawl north american city inherently unsustainable fsd wont solve
pretty brave risk one honda test p
know right
lidar radar etc work interaction full autonomous car would car system interact
someone cant drive wanted car really need tech
wont
cant unless vision issue youre paralyzedyou ive met person arm driver license
gpaull certain health condition risky besides yes drive dont like renting stuff doubt thing truly like tesla supercharger network shut like coronavirus lockdown essential driving imagine able run someone house help dont qr code doctor appointment activator get self driving car going declaration emergency stuff come
biggest concern hacker hacker access pc thats hacker access autonomous car think people also worried make video
keep changing title insecure titlemaking skill
dont get distracted autonomous vehicle clearly never encountered one do attack lidar sensor highway speed
cant wait take ride one car
amazing lazy human idiot would trust ai life car hacked easily facebook account car behind could literally make crash without ever touching car wow sound fun

safer sht taxi driver professional opinion ex cop ive car last decade im assuming autonomous vehicle least obey road rule
really cool waiting long time think covered obstacle didnt mention security term computer security like hacking car computer waymo system outside car specially interesting time nso pegasus using day vulnerability hack smartphones
whats remarkable clip isnt elevator attendant distracted failed notice customer approaching rather he distracted he got foldedup paper almost exactly size shape smartphone holding exactly way hold smartphones change much changing little
wonder handle pot hole ice inch snow car literally sliding place drive like ken block hill keep sliding backwards drifting road im also curious know handle mechanical failure object flying air toward like expressway something fall back truck get run sent air think autonomous car neat hope become common place fear maybe unfounded edge case weather factor might make driving le safe know situation car may choose park responsible thing rather risk drive bos fire miss day work ill research look good video
sorry derek way optimistic lidar work good weather condition eg heavy fog water spray car front deadly camera range lidar camera sound absolutely unbelievable like pick sign local road walk away take picture try read sign image wont typical range one talk using camera autonomous driving like max also see least lidarsensors mounted car video anyone thought cost one top least others probably like half top camera expensive lens supposed come even close claimed several radar sensor latter typically cost sum mean sensor equipment cost normal car supposed go massproduced consumer product last point want make energy consumption electric car already talking comparably low driving range sensor especially gpustpus processor needed make use data need lot really mean lot power doesnt go well together anyone mention tesla never used close many sensor high level automation reason recently announced exclusively rely camera future overall must say video feel like big false advertisement harsh may sound waymo specifically autonomous car general maybe derek tad excited
drive india able drive anywhere world man dangerous
india need car free city better public transport
tesla win autonomy hand waymo cool scalable approach lot limitation wont good anything besides taxi city fix route highway shuttle tesla approach general easily scalable
human driver killed many autonomous reduce accident even would much better
going unexpected consequence people cut pull knowing brake yield car jackers stand front knowing car stop rob occupant fun time
wonderful see enthused technology whose main ultimate purpose unemploy professional driver sort like lowering cost ultimate goal innovation
meh ill stick driving
didnt mention million driver unemployed driver union vanished strike government people le leverage government democracy weakened
wierd seeing derek hometown lmao chandler az
biggest concern vulnerability cyber attack
havent seen anybody mention snow way lidar work properly change technique powder heavy wet snow area difference completely baffle computer
hour ago yay im
far claim diamond play button
crap fake data advance recognition pedestrian year experience invalid nonrelevant dumb crap distract weakness technology btw accident coming substance alcohol keeping rule coming unexpected situation remember hard breaking car overreacting certain situation similarly unable well react certain others situation likely participant adjust bring advantageeg give way car despite realize turn blocking way going totally random traffic jam road need turn right today must rely upon kindness courtesy others would computer yes give way everyone passenger late doesnt anyone incoming car stuck place hour computer empathy risk management full automatic car fail unless prohibit full human driven car
jeez dude would advertise condom hole paid entire argument straight stupid difficult landing performed pilot plane cherry pick one incident pilot made mistake one plane landed doesnt mean plane fly better pilot take example landing hudson river think plane could make decision incident pilot lost hydraulics power plane land plane could land better pilot every situation airline wouldnt bother hiring pilot completely dismiss argument motorbike rider incident like wont happen often yeah sure thousand similar scenario enough one take place day situation traffic road behind hill stopped car behind car front heard massive ton truck brake behind simply moved forward side road dude missed guy front inch flying opposite lane traffic would car bet would stand wherecit stopped take ton truck as flying mph last least already see kid trolling bike driving around playing police siren portable speaker automated car stop every meter paid course sell b accident automated car would never happen
great much consume sensor stuff price car easily reparable trivial question
converted intercity taxi service people might drive overnight would good application
may video stepping stone autonomous driving tech coming time potential huge even bad road poor trafficbehaviour like indian city car would driven many mile average human driver would ever experience till happens everything magic
could offer deal car insurance customer car driving driving car crash pay extra rate would train people drive
jessica sweety hotgirl vlogs many many many people kill people road driverless car ever would
accident awful accident cause blame thats good part autonomous vehicle rarely go wrong blame tech company best part one order go inside yet blame others
think got nothing wrong statistic average median one four people suck driving people average average median different im tired people pretending theyre
put another way let say people failed test score passed average mean people average real life even unrealistic driver crash car fault random uniquely bad thats insurance get hiked punishment screwing insurance company know people crash car prone people uniquely bad think traffic law drag average taking extreme everyone earth tie perfect score except one person le perfect average slightly everyone except one person average average median man
also specific example survey taker thought people knew thought well th friend get atfault crash one totally reasonable result reflect could completely accurate selfassessment skill people believe average interestingly esurance report stat may flipped people accident smooth operator course accident fault different doesnt apply perfectly scenario
got driver license year ago living large city dont need car dont drive get car driverless b electric hydrogen yet unknown clean energypollution free
call pedestrian nightmare like driverless car theyll prevalent road really hope prioritize cyclist pedestrian unlike cgp grey show
car would probably slam brake soon even think pedestrian might try cross road like
glad see lack driver using seat belt

world really need autonomous vehicle
well come plane say bad weather want plane land really come consider bad weather really low visibility yes autolands limited relatively benign weather condition like foggy light wind consider really bad weather gusty windy condition sorry let know wont get autoland simply computer mentioned cant handle whenever landing almost foggy condition pilot hand flying approach except asian airline dont thrust pilot require autoland whenever possible hence mishap san francisco perfect day flying il service autoland available guy seldom manual flying managed crash perfectly flying plane perfect day
someone there always someone want watch world burn hack system cause crash id never trust one software blip issue youve
interesting view driverless car guess could really critissize waymo sponsored episode quick look news show different picture many thing going wrong think couple year well multiple autonomous driving system tesla fsd best one waymo potential become great city taxi service road constanly monitored change like road work closure fed system allmost real time dont think people buyin car massive sensor dont look attractive
idea degree camera placed road give signal car know mile away road clear fully autonomous vehicle drive high speed
get people wheel death road go percent thatll big government around world subsides transportation allow people drive anymore unless pay massive amount money
france many joke belgian people one go like belgium decided switch right lane driving left lane driving theyll gradually theyll start first month truck everything go well next month car switch nutshell skeptical driverless car
like driving chore time something actively enjoy
here one way im thinking yes software bug fail sometimes time itll fixed selfdriving car updated hand human make mistake lesson learned shared learning start generation
youve paid mo premium package
crouchinggrandpa taxi service
biggest issue think predictability correction failure like whole reason pilot airplane system encounter failure either mechanical electronicwise autopilot challenged correcting issue whereas human might right ingenuity compromise otherwise strategise situation
zrize dont think air plane car comparable stop car cant stop airplane
people dont even learn mistake
dont want big corpo remaining part logistics chain still striking power automated
tech nowhere near safe enough yet allowed public road
passenger jet fly critical point flight theyre far safer car mile safer ride car computer wheel human watch whenever autonomous car accident bound happen occasionally watch idiot shout bad idea autonomous car
meanwhile tesla sitting billion real mile driven gathering data autopilot data also used dojo training car

eliodecolli depends ai sensor think ai absolutely gut feeling likely way accurate one people
someone who used watch video like one since im mind blown
megaranator dont really think gut feeling complex arise deep inside development process take grain salt there great talk neural network learn ri channel pretty hard emulate humanspecific behavior
sound like pitch uber
suck driving dont like taxi im excited technology
highly oversimplified airplane go lot software iteration cost lot life car take really really long time iron implemented could probably save lot life technology work time
saying love driving wouldnt use autonomous car targeted city staying stuck traffic fun might required use autonomous driving city keep flow traffic going youll probably still able drive outside city without problem people day still enjoy horseriding like new technology fully replace old
say know theyll replace truck driver autonomous system first opportunity transport much cheaper quicker dont need pay wage driver vehicle run starting point destination nonstop except refueling
plane external guide system car arent make decision movement automenious car talk would trust ot lot
moron alert anyone doesnt see potential abuse remains freedom plan
gon na memorise number convincing esp getting accident figure date mile eqvt yr human driving ater mile accident none w serious injury human error speeding running red etc pedestriancyclist contact w stationary vehicle
stats singificantly misrepresentative million mile would expect accident kind human versus serious automated car got thats human driving condition road state distraction influence automated car sticking well maintained easy drive road looking accident misleading ignores disconnection human interrupted computer order prevent possible accident report waymo state happens every mile around half would result accident human taken
iskierka fair point thank fixed typo
one day youre gona crash one fuckin thing gona print crash report oppas ahaha
friend one way lose freedom slowly bit bit fun gadget without even realizing demanding cool stuff sadly people behave like sheep
driving hassle lot people really revolution pretty sure always possibility drive car prevent silly thing really good thing
freedom drive car think technology would work public transportation stuff
want see car india russia xd
hope many many people see video finally come around changing mind
dr missy cummings researcher help develop ai vehicle say still far ready ai isnt good picking anything hasnt seen vehicle freak road sign slightly altered spray paint getting old vehicle would come stop move saw bent road cone think still go
implication bigger imagine like parent put child thing send grandparent house happens concept car ownership every house world garage happens carparks impact town planning leave work early worked commute many question
im sorry video sponsored waymo probably say content even think derek integrity cant take seriously feel isnt hard question independence
counterintuitive human suck everything thats intuitive epidemies terrible government car traffic death grinder every day
dont want driverless car want free public transport safe liveable neighborhood dont constantly second guess whether car seen u
hundred time smaller le efficient bus
ill one better stuff said selfdriving
think also read strong town seen bike youtube channel highly suggest taking look havent already
driverless car time likely see human driver would werent paying attention
upside hummm video sponsored
dont believe beautiful ballet driving together car premise completely ignores cyclist pedestrian debris car would stop sometime people cant go fast car cross bridge answer sure neat idea hackable realistically shouldnt focusing much infrastructure entirely car especially service start locking people stuff nothing safety
motorcycle rider id feel safer autonomous car theyre predictable would indicate turning intention wouldnt drive distracted drunk
im motorcycle rider would love autonomous vehicle road actually indicate way plan turn everything see sooooo many driver fail use turn signal insane mention drunk aspect thing human
good point refuse take motorcycling except maybe backroads stupid human
sinodiogenes thats stupid
negative aside driving distracted mentioned everything motorcyclist know
possibility road endless autonomous car never take human driver car like autonomous machine one job motion detecting light
cant come soon enough
imagine point justify seatbelt indicator based statistic accident bump possible example highway pedestrian driverless vehicle far away car ahead report ahead time car likely tohad caused accident probably fine anything vehicle indicator like plane
pointless dangerous technology make car safer yes full autonomy need rail
waymo effectively rail actually mapping whole area car allowed move car another city would able drive half safely thats waymos approach way harder scale example tesla
teslaafondo point tech crash rail damage limited sat nav system moment make stupid mistake time google map accurate ignore regularly especially town hopeless countryside flooding would system react
year away youre europe american road super easy drive ai width grid layout good luck getting navigate european road right nothing driver staying lane poorly maintained road road wellkept like im sure know much stricter driver training isnt enough space two lane people going give way negotiate road ai cant also cant roundabout
europe could see automated public transport
wont work rd world country infrastructure lagging decade policy lagging century
literally said video
could address issue tech solution increasing demand rear mineral sourced problematic situation consequence replacing existing stuff need disposed new produced
id prefer robotic driver roll eye question mid drive seem cool
waymo evolving term road travel without driver seems like someone behind wheel much faster training model drive placeswaymos approach seems based mass surveillance area would driving want
yes
im good idea population major city opting autonomous vehicle dont let car enthusiast want able use car even pay kind larger road tax also fact people point environment aspect driverless car important even imagine self driving car rural eastern europe gon na mistake pothole cliff
ready die dont turst technology body
using technology track every move know everything phone
million allow people leave home number lower like rona
opinion answer reducing traffic proper public transportation system like maintained european city especially u still carfocused address pool suburban citizen light heavy rail instead using autonomous taxi service besides technology potential close gap public transportation sort car sharing service able interconnect line service specific route enough demand facilitate bus service american city naturally made car theyre barely coping sometimes medieval city europe naturally built pedestrian technology amazing especially urban traffic environment huge boost safety plead city u focus investing theyre money public transportation instead swapping every car fully autonomous one still facing capacity shortage
work rd world country people cross road feel like cause stop stop constantly middle road otherwise kind cool would still want car
could work work country build car europe dont think would work expecially city little road people everywhere bike sort moron street poor state road sign general
sound dump isnt half people could better average example human average quantity ear average human two ear people extremely low quantity ear drop average lot also possible driving lot thing
reasoning incorrect dataset number ear discrete dataset whereas driving skill continuous average number ear meaningful way average driving skill
best content im waiting thanks sir dedication
would like get public transport tern car road
one best sponsored video ever im sold lol
good boy
drunk coming pub thats bar burger problem hit auto drive
wondering would happen armed robber jumped front car would car stop
yes
course video didnt mention competition fact lidar radar might solutionother cant wait car drive
ok discussion system hacked know system eg linux laptop hacked much smaller target system driverless car become big enough target hacker especially sponsored agent already technology mapped waiting right moment strike think bigger factor delay mass adoption well random conspiracy theory various level nut

driverless car thing communal thing like taxi service like waymo otherwise induced demand gon na lead car road pollution traffic similar elevator dont see personal elevator communal thing thats work
thing want computer driver redundancy one computer crashed park safely patch ai driver intensively tested p government start testing ai car deem safe road fully trust corporation

driving car fun please dont build self driving car
hope self driving car doesnt become new nuclear fusion way always within year away
would love selfdriving car everyday commute long drive sometimes also nice hit road go ride
seeing world car coexists
work world ai software development computer vision would love kind car also like take car go ride
samradwan field world would say interesting one ai software development watching ai slowly learns thing feel like observing cousin grows
houghwhite near future pay lot insurance premium want drive wouldnt surprised road youre allowed drive
houghwhite watching ai fail miserably simple task sitting dumbfounded
well choice would really want carless car road driver fine stay would walk use public transport instead
finally beer way work morning
amazing technology huge turbine sound
driverless car road lesser accident le human driver make mistake also need lesser flyover andor road infrastructure
lot question still answered full autonomy plane unfair comparison elevator even worse like driving im ignorant benefit autonomy offer edge case road perfect really edge case demonstrated super jerky brake also legal ethical concern autonomy ready widespread expected better channel ig money lobbying dilutes science
watch navigate orange cone see stop middle street blocking traffic asking help human driver work great day yes ready today
isnt lidar laser consequence skin environment imagine one car billion car emitting scanning laser gon na happen know eventually would central lidar system certain interval autonomous car linked central server
find interesting think change way using car dont need car worry finding place park live someone drive around whiteout reason probably stop parking bike lane also stop thing could problem would drunk person could stand block way self driven car
snow camera seem rough time also reflected decision testing warmest city u
someone doesnt arm im happy
grade school guy without arm presentation school played drum put button fly jean drove van made realize find way anything want enough
gpaull young uncle didnt like upset wife like yeah right everything possible
hello mr derek thanks video believe safest drive environment day car autonomous situation accident practically impossible long mixed environment autonomous car remain underdog matter much advance agree elon musk one detail though use lidar radar system sufficiently developed software lidar arent necessary advanced vision system achieve full environmental awareness using traditional vision maybe using infrared help seeing fog lidar expensive highmaintenance device best replaced highly sophisticated software thank
completely agree computer act safer human however one serious disadvantage hackable digital warfare even demonstration hacker group could lead deliberate accident might affect one car entire series hacking doesnt even manipulate car software scenario adversarial attack also conceivable ie deliberately placing carefully crafted object environment disrupt completely undermine object recognition several study show possible theory keyword sada also fascinated technology would use class vehicle immediately available germany also see problem mentioned video
still concern actually mention good condition inclement weather onboard sensor handle rain ice snow etc good condition ill agree automated driving far safer live uk changeable weather condition often far ideal point note cat autoland us external fixed radio beacon instrument landing system il pilot still make final decision cant see runway ft altitude abort landing system allow full automation apron require external antenna embedded runway taxiway flight also heavily regulated good comparison
course tesla think moon yellow traffic light
become even worse driver dont practice let computer drive u let autonomous feature safe assistant
finally drink drive
kind driving apex challenge self driving software
car dont fly
think done really good job explaining physical tech behind car statistic regarding autonomous driving half deal even important software behind sensor even best lidararray nothing without proper interpretation data collected would love hear cause hardware trust software
need make car visually appealing
yeah selfdriving car exist right ugly af
hacking car connect internet driving
people earn living driving profession
wish could experience wonder would feel avoid riding unnecessarily others behind wheel constrained obligated cant tell people im afraid drive would offend p im also passionate car mind also imago could go wrong car cause accident wow comment video must record still exited see road
would love see driverless car road road commute somewhat poorly maintain compared west city year ride could bumpy worse motion sickness problem guess better getting accident price well wait see situation
wont break check get frustrated step punch car fail
maybe one day driverless car
saying kind vehicle decade council arent even repairing pothole timely manner selling car take directly mcdonalds get hungry car multi storey car park china town snow new york infrastructure built australia course accident caused human error drive order one price get back
self driving car still car even electric require parking road energetically expensive manufacture car destroy city make living miserable
prediction assumes people wouldnt car car would taxi like way dont need park car would drive pick someone else time theyre needed theyd go back depot
conclusion dont need human
people horrible driver horrible driver licence since accident cant say approximately many kmmiles want autonomous car know much suck driving bad human driving always afraid someone else driving usually terrified people behind wheel see mistake mine well mistake traffic average get terrified usually afraid
even fully autonomous vehicle wont become adopted comin year glad least many improvement trickle manually driven computer assisted car recently pleasure drive new model bmw surprised useful reliable lane assist one point paying attention construction work taking place next highway without assist would likely veered lane reduced width due construction work thing become common humancaused accident reduced frequency severity interesting point also autonomous vehicle used airport port warehouse etc maybe controlled environment compared real traffic work quite well already wouldnt bat eye shuttle bus airport doesnt driver
thought kinda awful prisoner car cant stop wan na eat piss whatever also costly af like driving wouldnt want definetely everyone use even theyll cost regular car future lmaoo like cyberpunk thing definetely best taxi
also work aqua plaining
hacker hacking car driving around suddenly system hang
early adapter answering machine technology early found answering service expensive really best conveying message urgency lack urgency needed also often service answered put person hold minute two many people refused leave message early day curse machine five year later technology widespread majority acquaintance one home
predicting type transport year send one ill test heck love innovation
cant wait world big tech company get decide whether im ideologically pure enough travel autonomous car
another stellar video veritasium preparing u driverless future
technology indeed ready mature enough consumer use country city autonomous vehicle simply work road mess usually jumbled traffic ever work unless government authority also stepped alleviate problem take lot time probably year decade especially country motorcycle common vehicle like asia especially country indonesia would nightmare challenge ai able drive flawlessly country
waymo car software get hacked
one problem technology lot u simply enjoy driving people take l
machine match instinct reflex driver let alone empathy survival instinct save life hairy situation besides wheres fun driving people getting intensely fake artificial day day
id waymo comfortable waymo car tesla thats sure
want driverless car want kill people dont care surrendering autonomy big tech dont care dying minor bug
many car ride people oblivious affect driver realize autonomous driving would better outside reality ask robot choose crash scenario moral choice hitting human ever think omg going serve avoid accident hit guy helmet v guy without one
opportunity use driverless car driver license driving uncomfortable since many people road basically testing reaction dangerous behavior feel saver give system see everything instead one direction partly blocked vision human driver discussed problem ethic depth might look problem usually case specific safest thing trying minimize damage much human important video hope make people comfortable
way make system foolproof would somehow eliminate nondriverless car road system orchestrate every car road like traffic light orchestrated across whole city traffic would flow effortlessly thered giving people time slow speed would happen effortlessly like symphony cant wait day know people enjoy driving im happy passenger still drive manually need system assisted cant screw thing accidentally
selfdriving car cool would rather see effort made improve frankly develop public transit system area already overly saturated driver
missing point selfdriving car future public transit system better pick drop exactly desired location decentralized without many single point failure run inefficient public organization
sstrichard walk good idea walk dont want city look like lifeless wasteland already automated metro system transit station thing pop near station eventually
approximately global workforce make living transportation society become interesting place live universal basic income dont become thing
high quality content always
cool id miss feeling driving love driving much wouldnt want let go
afraid one day might even become illegal like car autonomous accident caused manned car sure law passed dont worry sure time good vr let experience manual driving
yoru agree though well buy vr headset instead car could hear v roar vr without actually causing much damage environment
im sure could drive car private area fun people still ride horse fun never see horse highway
ok airplane bit stretch simply true
huge supporter technology make road safer qq million mile autonomous driving experience equal year human driving experience understanding correctly human would need drive year reach million mile human learning experience driving would ai learning curve
wonder car would handle street delhi
step get repair job one many streetside garage shop step overrun cow get hacked piece angry mob
derek great scientist engineer stop trying lecture engineering
dont let deter fact tesla money hungry corporation reply microtransition anti right repair
veritasium thought tesla approach automated driving
glad see didnt end shipping container remote platform
wonder handle different weather condition like rain snow
cant see rain fog snow using lidar since us technology driving pretty much wont able adapt without would completely separate system albeit manage make work easily train existing data drive without lidar tesla us lidar confirmation system
bankruptgreek tesla doesnt use lidar elon said doesnt like
bankruptgreek car arent equipped though correct
nzotxsnipes yes
badly even strong wind black ice
cant wait till racing ai car underpass
cool hella pricey
sponsored waymo well obviously derek need make money tech cant speak price try sponsor comma ai tesla people actually working solid solution doesnt rely billion high cost sensor
yeahhh well id hate see autonomous demolition derby like see dont tread v lololol jkjk
one thing didnt touch cyber security side autonomous vehicle doesnt matter good make vehicle hacked im excited see future hold autonomous vehicle
yes male driver car without driver female driver much ask consider others traffic keep simple laydiees
wont drive right country road uk need lidar thus car isnt self driving smart worked longest people written lot edge case road demo
ill stick petrolfuelled unassisted car weekend simple reason mechanical joy one exquisite commuting assisted automated emergency brake front rear etc better id even take optionally connected automated car hydrogen fuel cell better traffic flow weekend empty road ill fight joy freedom bliss manual car provides thankyouverymuch
even tech autonomous vehicle might present legal political infrastructural condition lot question problem solved
pitotstatic system
yeah iced dropped atlantic
cant wait driverless carsthey game changer human history
aremnantdiscipleofjesusthechrist mean
dont care benefit im handing security ai may prioritize life someone el
youre traffic one leaf enough room change lane human would start slowly creeping lane theyre changing someone let
heavy traffic currently would like see movie wait
octaveobsessions cant imagine stopping lane wait change
blackjeepconvertible lane stopped car behind change lane fill full neighboring lane even passenger endure honking finger driver happens many country naively try follow regulation
want driverless car road google romania highway youll see
sure id want mega entity able monopoly human movement however safe convenient dont problem driverless car isolation many factor outside obvious car crash poise even greater risk
car automated traffic would eliminated highway
agree many weird accident see day there way werent caused someone phone many distracted driver
hmmm mile match driving indian road
rich people solving rich people problem much sensor cost much would cost maintain much living space would ruin make easier car self drive train street car much simpler solution would cost le overall build maintain safer
best part imagine everybody driving driverless car every car could go faster every car comunicating whats going around would super
tesla full selfdriving fsd software insurmountable lead term autonomous driving
human depending technology way much
would rather technologically advanced reliant car higher chance accident
think people tune theyre riding autonomous car way stop thinking good human driver cant stop thinking bad human driver ive ridden driver made genuinely afraid going accident ive also ridden fastaggressive driver didnt worry two minute might pessimistic estimate rarely take two minute decide driver good enough stop thinking
biggest problem danger driverless vehicle vehicle driven people
least good condition yeah rest world count rain road get flooded snow ice roadworks pothole dense traffic follow rule etc airline pilot hear aviation related anecdote clearly utterly misunderstood wonder told thing inaccurate assure simple process land plane fog using autoland take specific training multiple path failure monitored carefully time take make decision take apply accurate safe input split second judgement careful assessment weather foggy condition often change quickly airport traffic capacity halved strict maintenance rule aircraft airport infrastructure certain airport cat iii local terrain airport characteristic airport declares low visibility procedure crew make determination sufficient fuel wait join queue land divert list management complexity extensiveso apt analogy car somewhat different problem see collecting data phoenix going relevant driving europe asia sensor fitted car need technological leap lidar simply going work common condition needed sensor road car get information traffic road condition infrastructure like aircraft like aircraft limit ability automate specific area suitable expect infrastructure regulatory cost escalate also expect regulatory maintenance cost car extremely expensive maybe make small car uneconomical technology suitable bus hang already called tram individual little car driving around autonomously proper public tarmac road condition possible current tech thats
agreed particular current sensor perform poorly snowy condition center line edge road become snowed sign become covered snow arent testing car rochester ny testing pittsburgh pa reduced favor phoenix az florida
thanks insight im researcher area autonomous driving also think derek way optimistic say lidar work good weather condition eg heavy fog water spray car front deadly camera range lidar camera sound absolutely unbelievable like pick sign local road walk away take picture try read sign image wont typical range one talk using camera autonomous driving like max also see least lidarsensors mounted car video anyone thought cost one top least others probably like half top camera expensive lens supposed come even close claimed several radar sensor latter typically cost sum mean sensor equipment cost normal car supposed go massproduced consumer product last point want make energy consumption electric car already talking comparably low driving range sensor especially gpustpus processor needed make use data need lot really mean lot power doesnt go well together anyone mention tesla never used close many sensor high level automation reason recently announced exclusively rely camera future
kappakiaus thanks mate great input regarding tech requirement guess show current branch development could culdesac road infrastructure solution lie
thank
imagine relief elderly really drive well anymore
production car many camera radar van video id open
cant wait time saving im concerned one thing dont know vehicle powerful scanner people street tracked time someone control data recognizes stop meter away face different need strict law prevent bad thing
already reality everyone tracking device pocket gathering gps data logged social medium network people willingly put personal information phone think people capitol riot tracked detained everyone recording willingly putting evidence social medium network tandem gps data allowed police track
mean end soccer mom driving boy early hockey practice pack em driverless wave goodbye go back bed
yes take back home
amanda yo check vid good question there old age there many slip cup lip situation like underline difference physic scientist one hand engineer
would happily buy autonomous car tomorrow incurred zero insurance cost protection civil action accident might happen want autonomous vehicle always act solely best interest occupant real hurdle well accept ten thousand death year caused human error even th many due computer error would unacceptable many
bet running friend autonomous car making inner city car traffic finger crossed im feeling pretty lucky
cant wait get autonomous car absolutely believe overall road much safer still would like know would car choose different bad outcome thing control system live slowmotion world response time order magnitude shorter law physic dont change definitely case computer fast enough see accident coming physic situation speed mass braking capability control authority etc limit option available prevent case also situation available option bad outcome long time thought wouldnt happen simply car taught drive conservatively defensively would never encounter situation like dont think thats true even exceedingly rare event happen given enough mile driven car im naysayer totally believe autonomous vehicle definitely something im curious
hasnt already done ad bmw year ago
fun game one day car ai say good morning derek car mine control make sure seatbelt fastened youll really need time sound door locking
long there always option human override autonomy think ok
yeah give away freedom robot tech overlord
stay estimation driverless car commonplace year dont want sooner dont fulfill requirement yet especially legal requirement public sentiment lety cavalcante said driverless car prove experience successful realworld execution start program big city probably select city first concept good conventional car overwhelmingly better overrule public concern safety ethic job many area service like uber fight legal battle compete traditional taxi establishing driverless car much difficult dont shift drivingrelated job eliminate concern like safety ethic doesnt matter much statistic say even reality public sentiment therefore voter heavily shape legislation related lobby wont sit idly either
completely agree derek think really understated important point driver aid ie vehicle fully autonomous actually reduce safety rather increase order fully autonomous vehicle work reliably requires multiple redundant sensor build accurate picture surrounding environment today technology lead vehicle design visually appealing average consumer said fully autonomous vehicle largely completely eliminate need individual vehicle dont think anyone care taxi look
sure would trusted life anything absolute pinnacle current driverless tech hell forgot waymo interesting see theyre still around
car wont even move live
yeah yeah talking safe always watching road tripalmost every shot
prefer old title current one driverless car already
people like current one including
india really needed sx
technology might readyish still huge obstacle withstanding public perception mentioned legal system isnt ready yet state actually anything happens road criminal law matter criminal responsibility business still infancy dont want crash driverless car bear responsibility one cost lidar camera stuff arent cheap people ready pay full autonomy sure nerd like u wont see benefit autonomous capability today almost everyone want driverless car inbetween people dont want car nearly everything still drive wont want going annoying expensive want full autonomy end people able afford level autonomous vehicle going wealthy already buy limousine chauffeur plus hope still able drive car want least area authorised self control lot fun driving car especially old one would really suffer conversion fully autonomous time love idea autonomous vehicle think might help environmental transition hand might terrible effect move people away public transport put car road spoiler already many car instead parked waiting autonomous car one inside zip city running errand otherwise wouldnt happened predict sharp increase distance run beneficial environment hopefully though small car like google car gain popularity would least compensate small bit
want drive despite benefit ai car
india car able move metre
title absolutely wrong want driveless car want fight climate change want lightweitgh car electrical car extra sensor screen mini motor etc etc raise consumption petrol metal catastrophy consider driveless car huge tank like tesla good thing humanity
yep le efficient public transport
think there tho le accident mean le need producing new car turn mean le pollution one prob many aspect consider
whiskypapa raising level technology often come rebound effect concerning consumption ressources sure consider maybe good thing general bad sign car use whole ton sensor energy high technology rare metal etc replace human actionlabour machine us extra energy anyways could interesting always story hear internet save climate since use le paper today impact internet climate change huge percent global gaz emission etc etc
situation cause accident happen probably almost never happen virtually empty road phoenix arizona experienced almost every day almost every driver city like amsterdam milan probably also nyc la im disbeliever critic
also like technology think treated subject objectivity time check bias address question one plea
use train tram
country miscreant unnecessarily annoy carfuturistic tech require new law infrastructure
actually like driving hobby never
ditto want downgraded passenger
want drive never want wait see happens one know drive hacked longer able drive delivery n getting work emergency
see one problem would beneficial different manufacture shared analytical data could improve equally dont could see becoming problematic
good thing google pretty much one advanced technology technically already sharing analytical data
driverless car answer question absolutely one asking
look insurance pricing
one thing often ignored people want drive car boring commuting time nice drive nice country road similar driverless car may better driving cant enjoy drive
exactly like driving sure sometimes driverless ride would nice going nice cruse something enjoy giving
might take one come cool as convertible
anyone driven least know driver idiot wish driverless car
terrible comparisions plane dont exactly plane cm runway biggest challenege road user especially terrible people driver
long conversation autonomous car day im ready time saved safety increased road eliminate human element increase safety human perfect mess way much people say negative thing accident malfunction say ready dont understand human cause far accident autonomy ever
think biggest hurdle potential job loss every technical leap brings change work landscape life saved definitely much greater positive impact imagine bus driver truck driver parking lot attendant lot others impacted technology company work policy maker policy researcher ease mindset
want self driving car yesterday ppl terrible driver im cyclist get driver license pandemic dont want use public transportation since health problem know bad driver stupid amateur cyclist plenty law police never enforce nobody really care
could anyone doubt mean would think pub hillbilly bill better driver company full mechanical engineer programmer
able make rescue alley highway
good insight though average energy consumptio ai driver mile driven driven
way long term make road safer make car driverless humain make mistake also make deliberate criminal choice breaking rule benefit depend safety others unconsciously every car autonomous communicating one another unpredictable behaviour car follow rule know react one another knowing intention every close autonomous car sector human better computer make unique decision never seen situation emergency stop button come play
thats cool bjt tbh card become driverless ill miss fun driving
new problem hacker clinton entirely new way suicide people
way convince people benefit new concept simple visual showed experiement lot human driver asked keep speed driving around giant roundabout compared experiment driverless car human driver went stopandgo traffic within couple minute driverless car kept speed comparing test clearly show bad human driver traffic driverless car make transportation much smoother
agree said video feel like min waymo ad far uncritical
course automated car better human driver human stupid impulsive able get drunk easily distracted limited sens prone error judgement list thing make u terrible dangerous activity take lightly astounding really honestly human obsolete technology surpassed limitation ai better job basically everything make lawyering medical imaging analysis diagnosis trading stock physical robot many time faster stronger look manufacturing industry robot parkour drone swarm ai think thing left human even art
seems like poor replacement bad public transportation infrastructure designed around people arent willing change fake car culture driven almost americanscanadians car gas company
exactly solution road related death traffic drastically reduce need drive first place
best awnser train best
issue waymo huge additional equipment roof cost wayyyy car year stat applies car normal person buy
price lidar went way year still expensive expensive
waymo open office looked horrific isnt google investing billion profit towards comfort employee
show canteen pull flask
agree maybe derrick equipment also sounded horrible computer fan sound grabbed attention
open office horrific theyre noisy uncomfortable cheap employer try sell flexible cool even covid germ factory one worker brings respiratory virus everyone within week worked one last year career glad retired
haa look many people trust vaccine prone conspiracy theory technology ready human mind think take way longer case elevator
disgusting un sellout
road city dynamic driverless car think child jumping road people changing lane road construction lumber sticking put truck emergency vehicle airplane dont thats automation work foresee automated car highway sort auto lane like hov lane bang buck
yet derek showed car handle situation better human driver already better human handle situation doesnt get accident stop park doesnt know failsafe already safe dont realise average people bad driving estimate capacity
xmtxx see tesla drive right flipped truck stopping road safe car flying around going efficient practical start designated highway designated lane
wait didnt guy get arrested he backseat driverless car instead behind wheel whats actual law
theyre operating special rd permit company liable damage there driver like driver assist vehicle driver responsible even vehicle fault
look forward point future going considered majority people morally irresponsible careless use driverless car
driverless car would make easier cop persue criminal run new buissness hacking car steal purposefully scaring rider money many possiblities
make think wouldnt new business arising combat
jewlouds surely told many possibility somewhere around internet project started primarily meant military communication cold war would image someone learning thing someone thousand kilometer away today called remote learning
please go cyber security side main concern autonomous car
cheap travel mean really cheap one arrive house take shopping work wherever see catching really quickly
problem logic regarding plane automatically landing dont plane want car able use want car driverless going extremely expensive compared analog counterpart trust plane auto pilot existed around year car existed year also use neural network drive hard coded work refuse use testing occurs also im finally get liscense people start telling auto driving future perfect timing
laughed hard fact human dumb even injure parked car
whats gon na happen road full driverless car lidar blur thing happens wifi imagine random person sitting edge highway corrupting lidar signal
good point curious research
bilelazzez possible scenario google signal interaction lidar scanner
person thing current car argument autonomous car
think main concern driverless car unpredictable people around like mentioned ish minute however obvious think car replaced autonomous car would definitely safe however transition scary case inconvenient speed limit outside city generally broken since necessary human driving error come driverless car would never break speed limit automated vehicle wouldnt really need speed limit outside city said believe said parking lot misleading every car converted autonomous vehicle wouldnt actually change number car would argue constantly motion would need much larger refuellingrecharging station regardless hope reach full automation soon
mean car based american urban planning problem wont go away efficient car increasing flow car wont make urban space liveable
american anything avoid efficient public transport
people afraid driverless car demographic dont want vaccine dont trust science juju magic beyond understanding common human reaction make life worse
autonomous car feature tried kill already take personal vaccine otoh never problem
octaveobsessions cool whatever bad experience auto car please add basket get balanced mistake driver absolutely need auto car start killing victim
gaearadan balance take account called responsibility make mistake get blame let machine make mistake get blame well one inadvertent careless punishable higher fine
octaveobsessions think company making car responsibility law give low penalty thanks saving victim would human driver number crystal clear implemented plane year insist sacrificing victim spook people
gaearadan hear rumble thats ralph nader turning grave shouting laughter whole legal profession celebration
freaking kill people wont get blamed
im curious driverless car handle inclement weather like snowy road heavy rain seems like piece covered otherwise car seem like next step forward road safety transportation
point human error lot doesnt talk weather condition
edde road human road usual thing see overblown reaction parking lot
bro video sponsored company make car cant point flaw
maybe include even video game simulate weather effect road cant ai
yeah warm road without snow clear marking rather easy self driving car snow cover marking well get course snowy part world bet also amount sensor cheap
one big problem future like connected network hacked
something fun l sleep think sleep highly exciting activity
mean look way sleep time one bird wyvern winged beast fly easily fish swim person walk flying plane helicopter real world one thing dream place wing feel air
last time sat ai car ended waking land fill night city
heck ride bike mile per hour mean tell someone walked faster vehicle lol yeah prof stupid human
important point mention moral cost using deiverlwss car using technology late im average driver caused accident already autonomous car would cant wait selfdriving car addition improved safety autonomous driving bring luch benefit reducing traffic jam people lose le time car available service instead owned vehicle le cost parking issue city currently crowded parked car become aggreable human
yeah derick dont want car ballet want road people cross safely
car account adjust speed since talk wont traffic jam either adjust time
big city enough space autonmous car even fully electric create polution tire ware etc need better public transport atonmous electric car take u trainstation service rural area city least average abled person average day
big city enough space autonmous car mean like driverless car massively different designwise especially one designed blend fully autonomous tesla model wont see car get bigger taller technology matures see widespread acceptance plus driverless car tested current street theoretically could actually handle tight street better make splitsecond decision full awareness everything going around time something human couldnt ever achieve even fully electric create polution tire ware etc regular car designed human driver exact problem kind irrelevant need better public transport atonmous electric car take u trainstation service rural area agree fully autonomous driving technology could come public transport option allowing many people reap benefit fully autonomous vehicle without adding vehicle onto street city least average abled person average day dont see case said theoretically fully autonomous vehicle could handle tight street lot dynamic obstacle pedestrian parked vehicle vehicle road far better human ever could theyd honestly see even better use city public transport much useful
jcm autonomous car spend time road congestion become even grater autonomous car take space bus wich carry dozent time passenger desing autonomous car autonomous bus tram get denser network complemented free roaming bus serve strange connection offside mayor highway never fully autonmous traffic couldnt get stile intersection everyone cross everyone always pedestrian bike tractor construction vehicle construction side stuck traffic light roundabout
jcm regular car designed human driver exact problem kind irrelevant need get rid much possible
im mostly concerned liability million chance autonomous car strike hurt kill someone fault going sued ai something wrong manufacturer going sued held liable something design took control away
theoretically cant manufacturer also unlikely sell car liability next year use think widespread autonomous car unlikely
wow thats probably disappointing video made yet waymo advertisement much wow didnt look problem driverless car spew waymo doctrine couple key problem decade ago people promising driverless car le couple year fact year ago mercedes driverless car said time need smart road smart car personally agree strong ai come pas likely happen solve fundamental issue ai system need driverless car also waning covid remote work simply dont need driverless car traveling much large portion world happening additionally waymo currently desperate funding around b hole desperately need win hope recent investor havent put much tesla still making money car couple problem needing nice road nice weather nice lighting driverless work best hence phoenix road area handle well even marked go around area mean long way autonomous vehicle sure monorail great fun wear need adoption remember happens monorail ask simple question dont reinstate train tram good high density transport car worst form transport planet due sparse density pollution infrastructure waste capacity maim hurt others seems insane yr ago better transport system moving people around crazy hope make balanced look driverless car system look last yr dev hyperbole last year worst enemy ultimate concept would love see driveless car implemented like short story ranbows end reality unlikely
thanks lot putting word feeling video wish society would finally step back carcentric public space allow people bike use reliable cheap safe public transport maybe buy time environmental apocalypse thats coming u decade
never replace feeling control car fun driving gone might well take bus stay left lane
hit pedestrian unlike robot driver able find hilarious
also feel like grossly underestimate many american use car illegal task
driverless world hacker dream come true
fight night lidar mapping computer vision radar range finder engineered silicon chip capable performing billion nit operation per secondvs fleshy meat computer bad segregating filtering input data see red blue close together decides invent color magenta ya ill take silicon thank
sure self driving car fact near future question question much far still privacy always technology collecting information u go buy may allowed travel anywhere may someone hack autonomous car hacked scene fate furious movie
mean technology nice im suspicious able drive shitty eastern european road well hacking probably vulnerability
fun fact elevator driver strike organized undercover agent big driverless elevator industry
satire
satire
automate flying car
comparison aviation deeply flawed acls around long time carrier aviation nature aviation made many variable controlled possible jet put landing true airliner many mile clear airspace well planned established route well managed deconfliction absolutely even close road car faulty analogy fallacious reasoning car road well regulated planned controlled flight would already order magnitude fewer road fatality put simply there faa flight plan atc road random idiot get driver license fine good situation edge case like la traffic sudden human behavior make dubious like jet dont dogfight autonomously yet risky trust ai unpredictable rapidly changing environment empty road night suburbia arent place car meter away rapidly changing lane people crossing street suddenly cyclist showing also point motorcycle ride lane state complexity danger factor increase yet case dont yet trust ai situation simply ambiguous willing driverless car everywhere car serf purpose replaced public transport like bus rail car egregious luxury normal planetary ill caused many road resource intensive vehicle passed time kick car replace mass conveyance
clearly explained video ai million time experience person could point complexity mistrust give therefore doesnt hold also agree partially point car kind serve purpose car driverless replaced public transport work densly populated area remote area destination could specific
ai isnt perfect average human cant surpass ability drive ai faster reflex doesnt need anything thats related driving car properly distrust ai reasonable best mind probably comparing driverless car ai something simple siri ai common nowadays doesnt justify distrust understand able scared bug anything cant really harm survival instinct still go haywire
fear driving passenger reckless diver nearly killing trip passenger taking note many people reckless driving trust driverless car need someone front safety car get puncture someone need first aid
ohhhh
well team lead last comment could well interpreted waymo dont trust self driving car enough commute employee make wonder trust provided waymo ever cover european city small densely parked lane oncoming bycicles one way road
good point good catch
car run gas im still worried carbon emission
driverless technology isnt related engine technology applied combustible electric vehicle sure engine technology waymo us whether theyre electric combustible tesla fully electric theyre actively working fully autonomous ie driverless technology
jcm nice
majority car street would driverless car could even interact know internal system far away another car next move car would also improve predictable system also part video much potential reduce accident drastically hopefully decade huge win autonomous driverless car
bet cant bring technology india year take like maybe year get tech india
love car much accept support
imagine first day car store start revolution
think car movie aftermath
driverless car tested shittier road like novaliches philippine haha
car o got hacked corrupted killing ppls road
safety hacker hack car free car ride kill person
fully agree idea driverless car would make road safer let forget already solution many problem driverless car want solve yes autonomous car would lead le space dedicated parking increasing green space city thats issue already solved good public transportation system good city planing need deploy fleet hundred thousand autonomous car city functional vast system allows people go wherever want walking minute metro station good public transportation system traffic practically nonexistent capacity way road occupying even le space expensive car way cheaper ride bus metro government spending maintaining expensive road infrastructure could reduced fewer vehicle road overall space road occupy could even reduced since talking green space could even dedicate lane bike many others love futurist solution innovation propose complex problem deal daily life agree situation solve problem better proposal definitely safer driverless car compared drunk driver someone distracted using phone let forget already efficient way solve tried tested method ive living germany last year compared time life back mexico used car time need need covered using ubahn train bus know walking bike quite popular proposing futurist solution put patch bad city design car centric design there life without automobile dependency situation promise city built accommodate car instead made people live mind would love see point discussed least taken account talking solution problem stupidly big space dedicated parking lot traffic pollution made car lack green space etc every answer proposal made tech company also take look people solve issue part world anyway great video always keep good work
driverless car already exist called tram tend conductor often remote operator concept actually dangerous good yet another integrated system used track contol movement people
person travel mainly pevs city id feel much safer autonomous car around cant remember number time almost got accident watched someone almost get accident due reckless driver
witnessed almost accident avoided human
avrywilson yeah surprisingly thankfully
marcusbartoli computer driver witnessed avoiding accident computer
driver le car look cool mainly small one around kg city traffic got u ride huge tank electric thermic btw city would amazing big downside transfered data needed numeric far fastest growing sector coeq year connected material mostly really dont need coming wont slow time need slow done emission growth reduce im saying place autonomous car world think htis balance benefitrisk sadly case today see later consequence able assume
auto low visibility landing bad weather would two different thing
also big difference sensor cost car proper sensor much larger chunk cost airliner mention easier see everything air dodge compared road
wonder use computer crazy crosswind landing come sideways
ai born human mostly human become stupid ai going like human become pet aiit look like pet dog cat wall e animation expressed concept petting human mechine ai
wait hacker get control car history tell u nothing foolproof wont long find way take control car
people even worrying niche moral dilemma human would probably able make splitsecond decision
american anything avoid public transport hilarious
self driving busestrains endgame
true haha really hate public transportation
crazy self driving technology still restart car get radio recognize phone
thats bad software made inexperienced developer
restarting ai driven car middle traffic play music
nise dont restart anything software made competent people point isnt even reason would also suppose case ai would run another compute device rest software
holgergrauslund yeah bet mcas engineer thought competent well point valid software fail kill people matter proportion
wisewikim assuming software cant fail example restating car use music reason imply ai restart well since shouldnt restart carsoftware connect phone case software engineer trash dont restart phone installing new app plugging charger
think tesla beter solution nearest future
yeah country average thousand people dying every year road accident
delamain bois hopefully car wont get emo run away
seee
wonder thing handle breaking rule road experience cant always stick regulation let say example obstacle road like hay roll fallen trailer there also continuous white line two lane road least germany mean allowed pas regulation must drive across continuous white line dotted one human driver would ignore rule pas obstacle safe moment really autonomous vehicle break road regulation purpose
yes already priority like people priority
yep based learning road law guide start mean hard coded restriction whole point unsupervised learning algorithm weight adapt simulated scenario
trivmtran yes car stop sits waymo road assist turn drive manually video exactly happening youtube
cant speak waymo work competitor there soft violation hard one lane example soft want vehicle stay there obstruction road possible room one side yet cross line ok violate long there vehicle ordered actually smoke test tech toss object like inflatable car front vehicle like mph closed course reacts similar human regard itll swerve decides better chance avoiding swerving violating lane boundary rather braking hard
mrslowestdso happens kid start throwing inflatables front autonomous car real world
get raged also driver week made km capital country wait get road high time drop idea everyone owning car replace automatic car trafic would safer wed trafic jam public transportation could get much better hate driving driving self driver risk involved completely wasted time could check morning mail read book watch mover something take hmin public transportation work transfer also wasted time properly use since stand walk change tram bus etc car usually minute still minute wasted time regular basis beginning mentioned km looking place live imagine much time wed
much safe world need asap used public transport first consider example elevator success even hasitation people use
also right must expensive regular people
extreme weather lot snow driving guess work honestly breaking rule im going pretend lane rest rutted crud
people believe average driver really agree sentiment video point extremely weak four people b c take driving test b c score test score average score three four people tested average bad driver road bring average fact good number people believe better driver ridiculous make people thought better median driver would raise flag
people thought better median driver would raise flag people conflated median average point still stand still stand weak point argument even based around median isnt profound th people thinking better half driver isnt surprising slightest perception driver going negativity bias perception one driving ability really measure confidence would far surprising number lower
problem driverless vehicle current road made human ai yes adapt wont send car gravel road anything
flashgamer meant like countryside forest video would love see
eventually would bad people hacking autonomous vehicle
knowing sound say actually average driver
ditto although admittedly live countryside uk small single track country lane often tractor cyclist walker wildfarm animal randomly road lived city cardiff birmingham driver absolutely awful also driving restriction terrible
jamesskdb live big city sweden saw recent video bunch drunk local ruining couple street sign got two car drove imagine selfdriving car wouldnt allowed take wheel
damn thing super noisy point though
realised point steering wheel car considered skeuomorphic
drive car fun necessity dont really care car driverless
trying work autonomous car arent trusted despite much safer human driver think reason way people perceive human failing versus machine failing human usually make mistake immediately try fix whereas machine mistaken belief continue belief despite evidence could due faulty camera computer locking software glitch etc im saying perceived
person czechia europe feel autonomous driving wouldnt easy u would really love see car would react old street almost painted lane etc
camera seems like many
taiwan
driverless car safer mean hand use make sure aim proberly driver might cut therefore le chance stray bullet
america one last modern nation adopt mandatory autonomous vehicle policy sad true bureaucracy luddite allaround ignorant abound
mean really cool agree driverless undeniable future problem private company builder owner vehicle government developing technology instead unlike private business ensure poorer people dont get screwed le safe technology dont think trust private business keep whats best u theyre legally obligated return much profit possible mean corner cut least pushed edge whats acceptable science tech help u improves infrastructure tax go instead building military base weapon
fully autonomous tesla dollar membership
imagine owning car getting air update get full self driving tesla
foobar think might wrong engineer know
foobar theyve already shown current nn advancement full vision stack work whats left finding edge case put nn training tesla much harder problem significantly scalable waymo first need map area want service employee control look fsd video tesla already sometimes need step development fsd rapid mind blowing honestly waymo also isnt perfect yet either enough ride vehicle stop middle road doesnt know requires assistance plus waymo avoids left turn ride often quite longer tesla fsd
wow number incredible stopped man obviously staying sidewalk thought yeah need work realized would never hear car say stepped front
wait asset purchase service subscribe wonder
love progression autonomous vehicle made hoping derek could ask software protection plan malware attack system driving think biggest threat potential hacker near future car
billionaire going space talk physic engineering go behind getting someone spacemoon
say driverless car kill somebody who liable im driven around reading paper whatnot car kill somebody fault kinda make pointless driverless cant driverless
car kill somebody fault fully autonomous manufacturer there reason think itd there ready legislation usa state say autonomous vehicle operating system fault collision manufacturer responsible year
still elevator driver bangladesh many office building
yeah well waymo mapped cant drive road
flashgamer waymo work pre mapped location
one people voted technology ready matter functionality yes working matter reliability would waymo vehicules handle situation accident left lane car coming ahead drive wrong side road keep traffic moving see would stop wait way cleared thats gon na happen car stop far enough wait realize safe move get past one example im sure million like would handle breakdown flat tire high speed criminal trying stop steal passenger stuff god forbid kill would stop watch understand seem unlikely scenario reason technology ready yet
almost every accident occurs extremly unlikely scenario course must fear car react situation prone accident
almost every quite lot almost none actually hence called extremely unlikely however almost every accident occurs due speeding fast driving failure choose correct speed according weather duo distraction phone call texting kid car
gergelycsontos mixing type accident situation wich accident occur course example mentioned common type cause accident specific situation may never even happened depending level detail car decides use make decision age gender lawfulness almost allways encounter extremly unlikely situation accident
zombieland probably feature kill driverless car stop zombie way becomes passengerless car
unless drive india wont able completely trust
cameron alondra agree think distant future may even need car like
car ugly
video extremely biased bordering corporate propaganda speaks alot safety human make mistake car doesnt completly ignoring software used made human definitly succetpible flaw bug safety concer isnt mentioned hacker week ago hacker shut major oil pipeline happen hack single car ram crowd experience proven single best way reduce traffic jam improve road safety getting people car altogether achieved major improvents already existing public transport infrastructure whatch adam someting notjustbikes wan na hear detail tech impresive yes extremely flawed answer road problem cant car culture root problem
yep notice shift blame thing working outside idealised condition poorly maintained road bad human driver patently false
try car paris go prison
support self driving car def want human driven car stop made
know basically rail system drive could taken anywhere electronic rail allow go everywhere quite expensive modification railroad need new update often place change due infrastructure weather accident simply time make difficult thing tesla strives full autopilot also strive fool proof ai could tricked anything need railsspecific place work
totally agree technology fully selfdriving car becoming advanced one day applied smoothly daily life still lot work done including variability complexity transportation environment country personally think could much complicated everything ever implemented technology selfdriving car
guess driverless car road becomes safer simply driverless car software able communicate car adjacent informs position hypothetically car driverless road every car talking car zone likely accident zero
calling technology driverless car today like calling car hundred year ago motorized horse future different think
hello biased derek hadnt seen
propaganda oh look perfect get involved accident culprit others source
test road assault coming brazil still see many way ill intended people exploit vehicle wont run away robber violent neighborhood
really didnt test alien assault tiger attack either there always one
kungfusing coming africa would much like elephant protection car
kungfusing road assault statistically relevant huge portion world brazil particular occurrence cargo theft irrelevant everyone life fairytale land alien assault tiger attack road there none ive heard common come
dont like driverless car heard cheat work
country people dont stay lane arizona
hey im curious see perspective mehdi v mould debate view
like idea however come put million people work usa year
isnt controversial future could create situation car pick want kill doesnt mean creator thr software actually murderer already made video
one freedom taken away stop going government doesnt want go
cant wait autonomous car love elevator analogy
happens driverless car attempt make move avoid heavy traffic something go wrong who insurance take liability suit owe operating company money take outside town shut pay uber driver earn money afford ride thing uber ended employment summary theyre great idiot know habitual texters facebook addict make applier people really drive car theyre driving car much political perspective sound like socialist wet dream
big question much extra would car cost would owed everyone like taxi latter like bus carrying many people
excellent video might make update speak also autonomous metro europe dont know u actually
real question regulatorslawmakers decide fully autonomous vehicle much safer make illegal car driven human illegal selll car fully autonomous
born remember introduction driverless elevator vaguely australia actually would accurate say vividly remember elevator driver
every car automated would problem every scenerio take account human human problem
make work india u problem driving around anyplace
welcome delamain headquarters
think last part interesting idea car ownership seems archaic time car sat nothing complete waste resource blight urban area car parked everywhere used
want see car try drive indian road
happens trigger happy policeman signal vehicle stop
bro give doordash waymo take job
would amazing
driverless vehicle next big thing
computer beat human chess computer experience played game shouldnt anthropomorphise car yet anyway
even driverless car become better driver significant amount people believe top
dislike taxi driver
phoenix u didnt tell
lidar trash edit cant autonomous vehicle without special road current road structure support cant teach everything around world see working la region year behind one
seeing grandparent parent get worse driving got older cant wait stuff mass market ready certainly dont want become bane road get older let honest people going pain road future way around hope max year car common place
disappointed uchnyfmqirrgumssqlbxa put marketing video addressing real state autonomous vehicle today positive video really want
world longer need human being
nah
yeahso car able drive large highway town much traffic let try raining heavily even better snowstorm busy road going mountain somethingcommon veritasium seems really needed paycheck technology ready yet may need surely least year mean plane example commooooonthose plane cost way car wait arent two human sitting cockpit watching everything plane maybebecause fully trust computer
future tell great grandchild actually drove vehicle manually wont believe
takeaway autonomous taxi introduced say nyc taxi driver strike thats nyc embrace fully autonomous vehicle also pointed majority accident involved human driver road giving freedom owning vehicle driving however want going tough sell public finally fatal accident happen two autonomous vehicle due unforeseen system malfunction shoulder blame issue insurance payout fleet operator car manufacturer software house self driving algorithm nobody rider agreed waive claim compensation term condition precedent eventual legal case set largest pestel force engineer havent considering technology year ready year accepted mass
stop trying sell driverless car something corporation developing care life lie making money shareholder
solution symptom cause imho check bike channel
okay much need pay car much borrow
sending light use lidar interact autonomous car differentiate others signal
appreciate acknowledge paid advertising yet still maintain traditional scienceinfo balance approach
price
human scared new thing subject would little worried getting autonomous vehicle however due human intelligence weigh reality emotion fully support automated driving factually better u human already know instrument machine stuff way faster efficient without single failure something may fail frequently succeed gap large ignore hope automated reality come soon become lazy spend time efficient time valuable thing human
im impressed whats already allowed u think testing autonomous vehicle like especially europe would lower fear people
interesting see different approach car problem many place driver le car type thing called bus train obviously isnt exact equivalence certainly big contrast america idea well drive car need automate v european idea didnt drive know one would rather live city almost car compared city hoard driverless car
ill start trusting driverless car work india
happens wire come loose electronics fail also isnt steering wheel brake flip open activate estop time noticing impacting crash
system requiring high safety standard often redundancy example computer calculation least agree
thing happens brake fail normal car probability electronics failing much lower mechanical part like brake engine fail many time repair car last year least right many time repair something like tv laptop ac electronics electronics rarely fail
prathameshpatil tv standing outside
give noooow arnold voice
neji good eyesight lol kidding
real problem see let assume car autonomous police going start issuing citation passenger meet quota
wonder car reacts road small truck car cross opposite direction freeze place go bit sidewalk truck pas wait till truck moved enough pas garbage truck driver driving small street id prefer car move enough let pas lot calculation need done ever happen right
driverless car arent amazing theyre pushed con man elon musk
elon musk definitely horrible person driverless car definitely amazing
people like use driving around hobby self therapy absolutely love drive ride motorcycle cant imagine life without activity
bangladesh there still elevator driver
fantastic video left question handle inclement weather passenger mess button steering wheel bad actor use jammer lidar someone commented robber using fake siren pull car also detect pot hole think challenge remain addressed fully video shift outlook autonomous vehicle
million panicking sheesh
wonder system good enough react unpropable thing know expect unicycle see driver bike intoxicated know wheelchair even people making bad choice thing wrong system must able react according see cyclist intoxicated drive differently around system need trained unpropbable stuff train car blackbird velomobile
little biased
mean legally blind lol
selfdriving car save thousand life every year inevitably someone die crash time come human look data thank god technology capitulate emotion irrationally try snuff
letting people dont like driving autonomous car make driving safer
dont understand one thinking abt job driver atleast hav think
legally blind mean
lol
flashgamer vision le
happen flying car
autonomous car tell point onesided logic sponsored even missed disclaimer
side argument exactly god given right danger people around time place real concern legislative corperate technological ie company know every single vehicle almost certainly one camera etc far concerning self driving ness car
viardent suppose side would tech doesnt work inclement weather problem dealing interference several self driving lidar car arealike intersection maliciously targeted attacking sensor network stuff like theyre probably incredible modern city many people use though
viardent riskfree life worth living people fail dont want see going plain boring life purpose society requires
ibangedyamama offer everyone plain boring life default people like bit adventure spice thing desire still go skydiving eat gas station food like living dangerously
ibangedyamama offer everyone plain boring life default people like bit adventure spice thing desire still go skydiving eat gas station food like living dangerously
autonomous vehicle eliminate intentionally killing vehicle
lidar worthless least come extreme weather rain fall fog safety primary concern lidar sensor go
im expert hope would invent new technology provide better safety
bunch drive around lidar one shine lidar another confuse car
jeez many aspect driving taken account commercial even driving personal vehicle future environmental impact people making living driving vehicle million job u alone insanely common profession world wide comparison elevator driver ridiculous suspect know got payed make commercial wish actually made something real
wonder uber ride sharing employee feel likely future taxi delivery people whodo thing feel
question would add steering wheel would dangerous somepeople could touch steering wheel
imagine started using ev autonomous liking government make rule update via software like red signal crossing stunt
still dont think feasible without special condition like perfect usa road smart connected road system road system give permission autonomous danger ml model trained condition cant ported different region like traditional software
ok couple thing neglected mention system error someone taking remote access vehicle cant anything wait inevitable something go wrong ever experience call satisfying call customer service imagine stuck control car moving high speed think must simple countermeasure thing like manual override otherwise else would steering wheel worthwhile unless completely different system thats totally mechanical
need flawless hell point someone dy road accident person driving error autonomous vehicle get killed wasnt fault
elevator still ride elevator time
july reported accident autonomous vehicle made mistake fatal accident involving autonomous vehicle general well see happens
million taxi driver go jobless
adam something answer gcp grey video driverless car think must able talk subject
another thing would love added autonomous vehicle communication theyd know ahead time one ahead would start break theyd simultaneously accelerate together distance would remain constant would eliminate traffic stuck mythbusters tested one small hindrance would cause whole line halt
could somebody troll wireless car playing siren sound loud
car wireless
redhair believe wire inside
foolish much faith technology driving car road even car self driving special road built minimize risk still would never reliable percentage fatality would probably decrease significantly yes thats lot really dumb people road
pretty much every dangerous activity argued away people given robot flying driving cycling gardening cooking food hiking grab
great news since couldnt pas driver license test even time finally bribe officer get
would better everyone around dont license
prathameshpatil haha guess already one cost k total including attempt
feel like would love autonomous car around country live car generally arent necessity fairly developed public transportation dont see coming time soon also concern autonomous car ability handle really harsh weather poor road far ive seen implemented clean warm well maintained city village middle taiga
safety fully automatic car isnt much issue mass unemployment growing population
derek claim pedestrian crosswalk strip mall entire parking lot open pedestrian slam break going mph max thats speed bump yellow coloring hazard u road curve around building huge blindspot guess segue describing waymos ai
record speeding lowest one lowest cause injury related accident u top speed limit proven generally worse overall partly people ignore also largely used justify traffic fine know personal experience really evidence fined going judge still fined even tried argue speed limit abused disgusting degree point proven largely irrelevant public safety food thought paralegal close decade handled lot traffic fine know
always find amusing star trek pretty much scifi movie see human sitting control driving ship
happens rainy day foggy day snow happens want go mountain road happens people like driving
still want drive car
dont like concept fully autonomous car imagine would happen taxi driver job going survive rest life
thank prefer electrical bile le pollution making better health le expensive
worked air traffic control tower elevator flight stair built new one year got happy day
car drive comfortably road delhi india buying asap
waymo sponsored video wonder see tesla crashed
car future bike tram train
think forgot worst hacking even though human hacked cant hacked extensively consistently machine airplane electronics work controlled closed environment strict regulation electronics exist coexist cockpit cabin car connected central imagine rogue worker hacking knowledge car many emergency stop button electronic signal computer execute certain step blocked electronics like science fiction cant let hal trust airplane automation closed loop cant trust car automation closed loop emergency immediate power controlled stop controlled stop executed preprogrammed highly secure closed loop computer someone asks car x redundant get safe stop wont accept car doesnt give least x redundancy emergency rogue behaviour
personally think autonomous car make road far safer eventually cut crash traffic jam etc also really enjoy driving biggest issue autonomous driving car whilst driving joy probably shouldnt get prioritised benefit implementing autonoums vehicle hope consideration development implementation
year human driver vehicle nonsense everybody stare confusion
dont want ever take unnecessary overpriced garbage car nowdays filled le accident
htvlog go channel also human time drive car many toy play
man would love car one question remains car abused kidnap people dictatorship government shady organization
human would still needed kidnapping issue
omg good condition technology functional stating still dont get people say wont autonomously driving car next year
video sponsored waymo doesnt fill confidence bias strong easy edit oopsies
another great video
driverless car never road rage wont cut curse slam break front make point oh cant get drunk distracted phone
absolutely stop ever hang cant right
yeah also wont better making decision exceptional circumstance like time sure accident choice either hitting tree would break head kill child crossing road human would know modified quoted irobot driverless car still way behind term decision making
karthikkeyan thats debatable best driverless car would much le likely get situation like like said video driverless car accident caused human driver stupid thing
also switch ti driverless car connected throught sort network making accident almost impossible hacker could big future issue tho
damn cant wait person drive daily say many bad driver need service wan na feel safer would feel safer people would driverless car
much driverless insurance going cost
want driverless car road boring
need improve even defense tool cybercriminality otherwise car might become massive weapon
dont drive car good enjoy driving problem automatic transmission electric autonomous car manufacturer stop making manual car since market becomes small autonomous car good people stupid dont want drive people still want drive car able
cant kind thing india even somehow bring know people never appreciate trust something like steal abuse
former driving instructor need
fellow driver instructor may disagree
nutpeabutter lunitics stay length time literally people trying kill day
rip northern city massive snowfall aint
wouldnt surprised year driverless car thing precise enough knowledge road good enough tech drive road without able see
descai issue visibility physical mess creature street snowplow remove snow sidewalk push giant snow bank street got ta improvise new lane reduced width street course every street get affected differently even becoming one way street much space lost snow bank there issue getting stuck snow sure automated car would deal getting stuck snow guess company running kind service would need shut service crazier day honestly believe sometimes much involved process self driving technology short human replica ai
road work situation drive road follow instruction road worker police officer routing traffic
thats good question
perhaps theyll invent sort electrical signal cable marked tape laid road alongside give car path follow
central station monitor car seen video would literally take inform hand x road closed traffic routed automatically
kind situation tesla trying solve amazing well theyve done still long way go exciting time
aremnantdiscipleofjesusthechrist honest specialist matter make clear man never able successfully account due immensity complex software engineering something people get information bad science fiction think there nothing human driver automation cant better
cant wait lidar radar completely needle lol
okay video tad bit disappointment statistic given derek extremely one sided show driverless car better example helmetno helmet ethical question isnt autonomous car le moral right answer kind question existed human year amazed technology video mostly advertisement instead informative neutral look tech
oh bot account
one thing video doesnt address lot ppl like driving maybe time want drive
automated driving mph window blue screen death actual death
westworld
im dubious technology likely represents loss people ability travel car likely linked sort cloud service useless company go im inherently cynical kind thing chance wont abused company behind also represents loss privacy go anywhere without tracked least one company within walking distance point vehicle driven human banned happen
problem start targeted happens sniper shoot main camera one used paint gun running car tried tried move traffic light back coming fast stoping intension hit back dosent go front moving traffic always complicated human eventually try outsmart car hacking trying manipulate outside shoud addressed soon possible
lidar car look ugly hell
think one dilemma would event accident liable driver
thought think future autonomous car manufacturer take liability look data alongside number incidentscrashes theyve well nature would expect confident car wont accident could totally mark dont see there widespread use level autonomous vehicle user personally liable
future wont car youll summon one app everybody else around also company insure
shadowebeb would travel long distance would car drive way back service new area want leave would better car stay whole round trip different vehicle also wait transportation better owning vehicle disposal way car also really referring criminal negligence who responsible vehicular homicide
litj make car rental like today longer term car live countryside maybe summoning car city much faster finding parked car somewhere km away space parking ticket insurance petrol pay responsibility question software car company charge theyll huge insurance number casualty due car fault would drop near debate wont relevant anymore
solution mass unemployment cause yet
think biggest issue self driving car always idiot dont keep sensor clean dont think change anytime soon
ive driven million mile never crash much ding holy hell many people tried kill road cant come soon enough also sleeping way meeting get utterly awesome
personally wait human error removed road people excellent driver make mistake time removed
doesnt need perfect better people far close perfect anyway
hire couple people remotely drive car wasd
gazillion percent sure lidar interfere density get certain threshold additionally sure really way go scanner video feed infrared maybe ai pattern recognition much better lidar
autonomous bus would able significantly reduce traffic connect people easily
hmm cheaper much lidar cost
im imaging driverless van bed inside sleep youre traveling would pretty nice like living room setup seat facing central table could play board game something
truth people would use commute could live expensive city like ny sf course would huge environmental nonsense
seems dope definitely worrying uberbolt driver similar apps cab driver general
cherish driving car
thats kind lame excuse people stupid stuff driving drive main problem many people dont see driving vehicle major task anymore something part time help people stupid way goi see point make sense city disabled people whenever dont care drive country something different take away lot responsability people need turn dull ultimately freedom
event e always look way light turn green people trying run orange light im also interested car would respond loss traction going black ice bridge example matter happens snow covering road marking arent marking dont get wrong really cool technology think need clear limitation people need understand right tool right job think would go long way dispel stigma mistrust
cant wait driverless car driving instructor messed im anxious driving car think im bad driver probably dont much experience driving
people believe average driver think well although counterintuitive know mathematically possible right like instance everyone one person could slightly average one person would way average could say almost people average whats impossible people median yeah
know know derek think people dont realize fact probably replaced median average would make sense people
perfect vehicle trust issue fellow driver dont drive maybe change thing
hope also program car start cursing pedestrian jaywalking
driverless car cool practically public transportation cant
quite bit live urban area took public transportation work year still maintained car could get place transit didnt go schedule mass transit couldnt accommodate selfdriving car could ability drive decline aging
program imperfect written imperfect human thing program doesnt bug glitch wouldnt want car going mph program glitch nope im good
im even excited self driving becomes legal way drive wont see manual driving outside track imagine smart crossing smart everything traffic longer exists
comparision number accident given mileage autonomous car human feel deliberately left
im happy made video time switch
nice minutelong ad honest average ad
cant wait honestly wont even need driver liscences anymore
would love available im driver house im disabled im always theyd need accessible option
think would cool subscription autonomous car company instead paying tag registration gas etc pay monthly fee vehicle pick every day work
people enthusiastic transportation getting google facebook treatement youre digging hole
npc expecting logical thought futile
since car wont drink alcohol wont text driving well sorta handle follow traffic rule reason alone already better
excited want see holding aggressive peak hour traffic want see pick kid busy school
tesla theyre allowed
literally ad think way much bias trust video
prediction driver requirement increase making difficult driver license operate vehicle make chance accident autonomous vehicle much lower adoption fully autonomous vehicle new vehicle requiring autoonly rental gain momentum taxi industry well uberlyft likeall taxi required autonomous new driver unable license time license eventually fade allowed track license drive protected course derby fun never real world application found much affordable taxi instead vehicle usher dont car mentality business dealership longer thing country move toward vehicle hub insteadwhere car serviced cleaned topped fuel eventually going toward electric huge parking lot free lot space vehicle communication road lane even emergency situation clear entire lane ahead resume full lot land reclaimed utilized thing lot pushbackbut sorely needed
guess going skip johnny cab technological progression
wonder handle parking lot wan na know handle people seeing driverless car intentionally driving nuisance ai car
go ahead there camera recording behavior see court
people might better tha average average mean mode even mean right skeweness median statement doesnt add
dont trust driverless car human driving car next
someone play fake ambulance sound prank
shouldnt want
prepare ministry love determined authorized travel location
exactly paradox experiance man woman us machine expect work failproof cause human know prone bunch stuff increase fail rate machine thus expecting machine good get upset machine stand criterea st lesson phisical manufactoring nothing accurate percictant mitigate tolerance statistic sample size disposal rate avrage human basically people think technilogy ready yet
anything driving operating motor vehicle shouldnt licence
happens lot car lidar radar around signal interfere
human better creative situation tough situation
human error pregnancy also
one day vehicle fully autonomous virulently protest wd
love driving id also love see day human driving done racetrack private property
thing set apart plane elevator car fact elevator dont encounter elevator plane really shouldnt encounter plane people want someone blame case something go wrong dont want monkey behind wheel would also hate car hit someone window update loose wire
think biggest problem idea driverless car majority vehicle road driven human mixture together make unreliable dangerous majority vehicle driverless would work well also would happen one driverless car stopped red light motorbike came knocked one camera would stop completely malfunction
liked stupid thing say job
feel like comparing driverless elevator driverless car false equivalency elevator operate within highly structured controlled environment predictable event positive negative possible outcome ride
problematic thing see car would behave predictable way could exploited someone ill intent example show car would react normal condition normal condition also edge case happen naturally road someone could manipulate system interacting causing damage mostly thinking insurance fraud
good navigating windy country side road soft verge plenty single width section feel tech great certain country lot grid like boring straight road
matter minute forget driverless vehicle haha driver passenger car driver still keep focus road im driving
often im comfortable driver ability always trying read message pick music phone
im tense im driving passenger seat really confuses brain although im backseat dont feel thing
sonnargaming wow thats messed shouldnt road
sonnargaming passenger seat vehicle driver would calmly ask himher pull side road would take phone see high make bounce
brain simulation completely helpless
gas tho car fill gas charge battery
think pilot thing past next year
tell want stop park space
one place individual controlled system ultimately big organisation dont like idea
unfortunately npc love
aim laser pointer
sooner think year heh gl
fantastic million driver job next invention another million worker jobless gon na job taken computersrobotsapps
car
regard milesaccident whats human number derek
ya cool still want drive dope dont want law making illegal manually drive also think argument human error robot fix b thing understand robot cant
great technological achievement company making innovation space zero regard privacy passenger happily sell commute data advertiser third party make money thats real profit margin
video waymo interesting thought
""
derek look tired
ba dum tss
nice dad
wasting time
every car autonomous would death car k v hundred
doubt theyre gon na glitch crash
newer model certain general aviation plane starting put auto land functionality case pilot becomes incapacitated way passenger tell plane land pressing button doesnt worry experience pilot main one im thinking garmin auto land piper interesting stuff
well problem fundamentally deep learning model power versatile biological counterpartatleast nowmillions mile make driver goodsafe driverthat part misleading technology used learn actually crude one without intelligence thereby needing much trainingand fact crude high likelihood even model anticipates human well based training one location auto generated simulated data fail catastrophically used different location different demographicagain saying wont get say may easily debatable
one example human driver get blind eye deaf ear middle drive still complete trip successfully remaining faculty lidar malfunction something obstructs camera
good stuffwould even better could finally expand past walled garden phoenix year
car good simple would air bag seat belt
want driverless car road stfu
think driverless car amazing example traffic constantly flowing seems awesome personally enjoy driving much would wait driveless car majority consider buying one another side see continuing chase eliminating time longer concentrate travelling place place spend time working le time letting brain relax like dereks old video boredom good u removing monotonous task lead le opportunity relax overall still think driveless car going save many life need implemented
average driver youd drive thousand year accumulate sort experience sentence shouldve exact chance driving thousand year straight dying bet would le
yes dont think fair comparison anyway nondriving human learn drive say hr maybe thousand mile could possibly train ai learn drive car way time human start much curve much faster learner
chance living thousand year dying driver error fundamental constraint
car could really change insurance junk witness crazy stuff vision
much think google bought veritasium
may hard imagine american europe many place world already got mean transportation doesnt need drive called public transportation work well cheaper ecofriendly autonomous car ever
software engineer always advocating make everything easier make harder make mistake full automation pinnacle
mean pilot cockpit emergency computer cant identify bad emergency engine fire bird strike argue current technology plane take cruising landing without pilot airplane heavily regulated believe problem automated car strict regulation human change lane even braking particular reason want automated driving car need make city automated vehicle allowed road automated vehicle communicate others everything easily predicted automated car ready human love blame someone accident driver blame company computer
hope get year warning mainstream work delivery dont mind job obsolete vehicle loan pay also id love able drive electric van work someday robotised thatd sad
get part world road arent well maintained mean america
india
visit india sometime
u actually pretty good road depends state
every big country bad road maintaining million kilometer road hard oh youre going durr america bad thing sorry interrupt
im pretty annoyed part like he blaming selfdriving car working poor road driver training europe much stricter driver training u road arent le downtrodden u ai navigate road right narrow confusing cant roundabout cant anything requires cooperation driver u wide rulerstraight road organised grid ai still get stuck time time dont think see kind taxi quite year
im software engineer private pilot license semiprofessional racing experience trust slightest use example cat approach pilot constantly ready go missed approach instant something isnt right could gyro gps signal anything pilot right able take software tell tire close max lateral g exactly downdraft occurs average vsi second latency plus dont care language code always weird bug one explain technology simply isnt point fully trust human life
think missed major point video dont fully trust human life better human driver fully trust human driver human life million dead folk might disagree
like video mention human make bug caused casualty ai technology never perfect human least better
car even heavily tested plane designed plane still pilot car designed zero human intervention mind
would much rather car le chance accident one human even
aint bank robbery car
vertasium becoming walking advertisement google sad
also problem amount unemployment transportation industry transportation largest industry america introducing autonomous vehicle trucking uber could lead economic disaster
need putting fake person driver seat someone get blow doll stat
personally biggest worry self automated car able get hacked tempred wirelessly
showcase daylight easy night car killed person
cant wait come singapore
perfect car get bird box style apocalypse
work construction always someone running elevator
veritasium happens multipleonly waymo car vehicules armed lidar happen area would problem would cancel others detection way interfere
feel like really need followup video actual skepticism ad waymo literally pipeline company hacked shut operation caused miniature crisis wonder happens someone develops ransomware car right really arent many much threat vector skipping hypothetical question morality decision car make actually quite important putting life hand algorithm dont mean user car im talking car next one kind important public disussion privacy equity people cant afford exactly make law thief find way trigger automatic stop system hijack car rob people etc thats even getting technical aspect world issue road maintenance literally every city u lidar isnt cracked surveyor wouldnt exist simple whats describedi nthe video cant send lidar identify everything simply doesnt work way finally taking report saying well every time waymo collision human driver kind nonsense yeah course human driver dog cat arent driving car glossed promo company thought disposable wipe video back pretty bad awful misrepresentation fact case
nice id really appreciated bit nuance especially regarding climate change need switch back efficient mode transportation would nice put context public transport explained technology great addition public transport market much replacement
see one thing im going pretend run see react
prospect automated car interesting there question back mind time automated driving tech start become mainstream wonder itll car manufacturer install car factory itll installed third party like waymo whether selfdriving car road based one standardized autonomy system different competing autonomy system rise self driving vehicle mean death highperformance car theyre small niche car made quick swift tremendous fun drive see nowadays sedan le popular people favor crossover suv car road fully autonomous wont useless make fast car itll end driving speed everyone else anyways im probably rambling wonder everyones two cent
dont like video air disingenuousness driveless car drive require perfect condition road mean already fails europe road far complex may poor condition highway sensor percieve road human dont happens chance failure said sensor something simple smudge offset camera sensor without alarming accident car gotten human driver error stament mean car failed making road safer main goal developping autonomous car plane elevator autotonous one care elevatos much simpler car comparison pointless vein plane comprable even flying plane encounter le complex situation driving car autopilot isnt stand pilot tool said pilot consider first autopilot appearantly developped mere year wright brother flew comparison apt driveless car better average driver average driver rural area average driver new york skill averaging would lose lot nuance driving given setting
riding aurora hit piece video video specifically reason waymo operate place perfect driving condition current stage development probably doesnt adapt well
veritasium please raise fund study ill truly totally greatful help
still cant used traffic like jakarta bangkok
guy year enjoy driving agree autonomous car better future
attitude different among young well im lifelong petrolhead couldnt wait drivemy son different like driving like didand he looking forward autonomous vehicle little metal bubble freedom self expression lost
waymo figured arent wide spread even waymo manager said next five year keep saying next five year people dont trust well lot dont lot disability would give option leaf either economics technology think technology many situation vehicle cant perform well doesnt make sense rollout service location people
encouraging always knew ideal scenario autonomous car could network wed eliminate stop sign light etc seeing one actually work got ta honest didnt know class legally road big step right direction
hehehehehe hacker time shine hahahahah
prominent factor adoption new technology scale especially disruptive technology always cost autonomous vehicle cost much le regular vehicle cost much le ride regular taxi
drift tho
waymo ride far map includes place actually want go without driving
new car lovely steering assist notably lacking button tried kill couple time close white bit paint trying avoid big truck wheel came shoulder dont even three hundred mile thats poor ratio mile attempted suicide find telling point comparison situation structural design humancontrolled coordination ensured vehicle space completely cleared private use success rely human giving computer controlled environment thats environment allow computer kind control
dont want driverless car want bikefriendly walkable road
always wanted better public transportation believe though think everyone still learn drive though
elon seeing video elon musk hold x axii
car enthusiast ill make sure give bot hard time road
good computer doesnt knowledge one deer cross road going behind know slow situation
narrow border supply remind instruction developmentally amuse amid magenta girl right labored hardcover
comparison autonomous driving commercial aircraft autopilot interesting say right think useful emphasize current state autopilot tool pilot autopilot physically control plane sure controller directs plane go pilot make decision safely tldr pilot still commanding plane fully autonomous car good deal different
paving way losing freedom warned forseen imply capable driving inattentive careless better one day human driving permitted allow car going automatic fully considered hazard restricted vaccinesconform lose becomes service need private property happy
one got annoyed damn loud derek explained lidar thingy
plan cheaper uber ride driver hence make think twice buying car
reason dont prefer autonomous driving love driving otherwise im absolutely fine
problem driving part never problem letting car know model complex traffic road weather condition possibly imagine simulator auto driver drive inside sim problem long access information however real world car able know complexity road image processing sound processing context recognition
want soon possible
like delamean cyberpunk sorry spelling wrong
uber lyft driver sweating
think elevator analogy excellent huge fan long time subscriber google self driving waymo channel cool bedtime video
year later apparently replacing driverless car fleet self driving bus really need expensive ton moving box per person
okay derek got sold download car
effort put using trove lidar scan create accurate representation area
believe technology ok nonetheless sensor need lot rare mineral enough technology feasible scale
also show beeing tesla autopilot lot safer normal human driver rly cant wait full autonomous car thing press button app car infront door
want see car hold chaandni chowkindia
eldest kid almost ever need learn drive someone dropped ball youve got year boffin
someone need make car super safe drive like super safe driving one life pleasure way
way fully work future road maintenance maintained sign repair paint placement trimmed treesshrubs pothole unsafe road avoided etc even every single car automated user error still exists upkeep
think much better cheaper faster public transport driverless bus think st place people experience autonomous vehicle
bro wont work india
video generally well researched attempt capture nuance video blatant marketing piece clear much editorial control content feel bad viewer mistook unbiased overview topic nothing video untrue every fact carefully filtered allow optimism real reason think driverless car wont economically relevant year major hold regulation public acceptance rather hard technical problem well handle ad hoc construction setup ice snow drunk pedestrian halloween night looking nothuman moving unpredictably never million mile drunk halloween worst part numberdropping million mile mean thing basically solved truth mile cover fraction driving condition typical person would expect drive im reminded brian fantana quote time work every time
much buy one lidar isnt cheap operator compelled run rural area people shafted either service crap service expensive service combination cant see human driven car allowed road safety claimed set cant see rural area commercially viable
great idea black people still gon na get pulled smh
motorbike car idea driverless car appealing next someone need get rid cyclist
video subtitle must translated many language people le developed country would understand maybe fear autonomously driving car much
someone ride motorbike im excited self driving car definitely think make road safer
keep automating every one livelihood wont left soon
think driverless car legit flying car
love idea self driving car hope one ready however hate youtube channel especially trusted one like veritasium sell themselfs become commercial platform company still negative self driving car definitive negative waymo way tailor result veritasium seemingly regurgitaed dissapointing
would possible system hacked someone could send somewhere else
video sponsored skynet
trust car dont trust human drive next though
refueling
bad weather meaning low visibility enough turbulence autopilot disconnect pilot fly
public transportation even cheaper even le ressource intensive
wendover sooooo overrated cringy
day car road probably driverless car car drive like hobby
wellmade commercial waymo unfortunately give thumb since commercial waymo still good video though
sensor deal rain snow
waymo human accident there quality control human production there reengineering human there tonne millionandtwelve quality control reengineering vehicle especially selfdriving one
theyre really cool dang loud
genuinely annoys people resist kind change completely driver free city would safer completely different level traffic would drastically reduced hurr durr teknology bad
opinion soon see taxi truck autonomous driver expensive video leaf two question happens like car spam environment active lidar radar etc responsible accident happen
teaching kid drive year ago told driving car easy otherwise could essentially everybody get license drive one thing difficult driving car unfortunately cant tested standard driving test getting license one thing hard paying attention time hard everything else easy paying attention time cause almost accident
well said sir
hurry cause lot accident
lemongavine hurry able pay attention
new jersey everyone always speeding time dangerously reckless hope sort transportation take
would plane lol id issue car started flying
error impossible machine make thats bollock error entirely possible machine built people well tested chaotic environment far safer pink flobbly emotional computer people use seriously would design computer emotion autonomous vehicle wouldnt fail way people fail fail spectacularly like think computer utter moron exactly tell
get rather itchy foggy weather described bad weather youre taking two example one low one high visibility
always found video discussion ethic vehicle choosing person hit silly discussion begin almost every accident variation either driver didnt check blind spot driver going fast couldnt control vehicle safely driver wasnt following posted signage traffic signal ran stop signred lightyield signetc driver wasnt paying attention distracted phone radio etc driver intoxicated every single one thing thing selfdriving car almost never think thing id worried would inclement weather especially heavy snowicefreezing rain given bad half driver condition dont think selfdriving car much worse
reason dont want use driverless car like driving car longer distance yeah sure ill use autonomous need shopping visting friend family town want drive
colleague mine interesting comment self driving car hacked cause mass destruction possibly death
well thats encryption cybersecurity come even today already possible mass murder somehow manage hack autonomous railway system traffic light example many many layer security required pas legal use thats hasnt happened
changed title thumbnail
trust driving trust programmer ability code every potential situation trust programmer way trust driver mean giving driving make sure everyone else well im
selfdriving vehicle corporation selling people data threeletter agency
assasins murdering people hacking car despotic government controlling people cant drive technology awesome abusability suck hugely guess need open source car something
im full support legally blind person cant get driver license constantly beg friend family drive everywhere woman random stranger service like would convenience also factor fully autonomous car road would blessing
would nice upload whole playlist view
need home live car
software engineer often sceptical come artificial intelligence place world self driving car something make sense simple task computer theoretically extremely good loved investigation explanation well done derek
simple task
watched movie upgrade nope never gon na happen
didnt watch video yet title thank
older get actually dont like driving anymore traffic suck live driver reckless hell cant wait autonomous vehiclesthat horse sized spot ride around
got license want able drive car bruh
yes let give power large corporation
changed thumbnail
deal carjackers
tesla
driverless car get license
lift driverless car scenario different comparable also flight automation better huge traffic large manuever landing also simple computer clear runway le obstacle road like let take example train run track yet driverless train
cant wait driverless bus
main problem people utterly slow change every time machine take industry field people find new job take time essentially well dead weight someone feed dead weight
ever see city people would like rhough
would driverless car least year every car would driverless computer communicate predict human road imoredictable sometimes make sudden decision cause problem phase non driverless car
point raised form transport presented video irony veritasium hosting video survivor bias company account multitude unique situation accident avoided downgraded human splitsecond decision ice snow rain patch painted line missing covered blind corner visibility blocked vehicle road debris maneuver loss control situation liability driver owner company software hardware failure instrument affected hotcold etc etc etc
commercial pilot biggest difference automatic elevator selfdriving car pilotless aircraft general mean transportation anything go south stop figure went wrong exception course general thats happens aircraft however different first cant stop side road second usually fly pretty far away infrastructure even satellite link make timely remote human intervention bit difficult third safety factor aerospace order magnitude smaller ground vehicle speed involved order magnitude implies crash disastrous consequence true aircraft mostly piloted autopilot lowvisibility landing automatic exactly textbook perfect controlled situation sooo many redundancy extra antiinterference measure place airport start low visibility procedure make impractical routine autolandings clear visibility task simple repetitive like maintaining level flight constant speed predetermined route autopilot work great abnormal emergency situation especially multiple unrelated little big failure aircraft however require judgement call specially trained human usually two able make clever new mean clever skynetlevel clever ai developed remove pilot aircraft replacing pilot error engineer error little difference pilot actually spot engineer isnt think factor next time someone peddles pilotless aircraft
pretty sure rear facing objectively safer long go getting used self driving comfortable rising facing backwards
good sponsored video silod work road
greatest selling point fully autonomous car reduction traffic jam stopngo rush hour traffic
didnt derek show cyclist killed uber autonomous mile away tempe instead show tesla hitting overturned boxtruck guy bend anyone stuffing cash pocket like job live area vehicle ruined daily commute feel like getting paid waiting slow af vehicle trying figure
oh yeah lidar sux
least good condition technology currently functional catch though way neural network function car might react properly situation yet encountered reality anticipated designer simulation one thing human definitely better sense much broader knowledge experience real world say deny better safety eg waymos vehicle case coming researcher field
high profile people politician president use driver le technology point consider mature enough non functioning traffic signal even tough accident reduced car driver bump driver le car back due sudden braking driverless chance get involved accident due system malfunction blame company company provide insurance
cant come fast enough even person chooses car ill feel safer cycling alongside never distracted car human driven car course would need stringent standard company system allowed fully autonomous waymo seems way capable tesla point
fair dont trust elevator take stair unless im tall building tall mean floor
driverless car might fantastic consequence putting million people work worth people suddenly going get job computer programmer
person rd world country lolno
hope city get walkable car arent necessary self driving stuff amazing believe part bigger solution
waymo taxi company carry human passenger havent targeted trucking industry carry nonhuman product feel like would much easier adopt industry first
people live ruff neighbourhood bud like would feel safe car like new kind danger statistic car mass bless detached reality limit engine speed solution till real alternative built end
true revelation come robot control government wish happen mistake better corruption
knew ad everyone mother making video tesla fsd video supposed show competitor good
skeptical voted poll seeing video confident driverless technology
plot twist person driving car like rc
theyre apparently monitoring
need lidar determine distance much cheaper ai video scanning tech
tesla imo lidar reliable youre relying errorprone nn inference image always limited im super well versed opinion
person without arm go anywhere
im driving dont always follow traffic law dont make sense like stupidly low speed limit place making turn may safe illegal
much computational power environmental awareness prediction realtime need im halfexpecting limited certain range thats fairly shorter drive full tank gas recharge whatever power source computer would require inside car
offering view pilot actual bad weather strong wind typhoon hurricane thunderstorm computer land aircraft land fair weather condition however land irrespective outside visibility condition whereas human need outside visibility able land aircraft also soon system failure computer hand back control human
bad side think privacy would get smaller smaller big corporate company could get data individual also think quite impossible reach car autonomous since people want get destination faster due circumstance late
ad window sticker rob ime defenceless really thought one full conclusion yes ime fan
like argument yes automated car better people driving car therein lie problem autonomous car rather share road nonautomous one id fine taking ride car id super concerned could react appropriately idiot completely ignoring rule road said buy one idea actually drive hour way commute appealing
im technology million job lost dont tell new technology create new job sure people get screwed change technology new job industriy create new generation mean imagine year old guy worked last year driver like software company make firmware self driving truck job hope explained clearly mean
speeding ticket also eliminated
really like idea driverless car whole bunch reason dont see becoming widespread mentioned another year first importantly much data stuff seems selfreported forprofit company cant shake feeling motive opportunity hide le favorable statistic interest creating shareholder value secondly strongly believe driverless car better average human certain task also strongly believe theyre worse human task strongly doubt venn diagram driverless v driver skill completely contains driver skill perfectly weve century time revise tweak human driving experience account lot human shortfall porting tweak entirely new driver system going present u lot unpredictable situation also dont trust computer vision yet made huge stride past decade noisy output inability reason one thing fail catastrophically least expect like human would know saw car teleporting road probably either steer well clear entire situation pull get rest lot computer vision thats fact life smoothed software facilitate comfortable passenger experience finally big one going take long long long long time legislate even perfectly reliable even perfectly tested century critical rule regulation would need amended overturned revised america youll likely see sooner since right big business seem always preferred public safety europe lot rest world going substantially lengthy process ensure safety public ensured american would likely get completely hook also huge number people violently afraid change fully expect hear roving gang antiautonomy brigade deliberately running autonomous vehicle road name freedom said fully believe coming future although suspect lot happen country significant autonomyfriendly infrastructure pas wireless communication beacon computervisionfriendly signage like also wow cant believe read whole goddamned essay youtube comment hope youre okay
think another video dont want autonomous car deal problem arise along car liability enviroment public transport traffic volume attractive city minute city price
centralized control youre allowed travel
technology isnt mature u mature enough let go preconception
everyone one us driverless car accident
never good driverless car drive good human think every single person think better computer unless could fix people full never cant human approve driverless car
happens someone hijack car
problem isnt safety reliability weymo problem cost even tesla autopilot without lidar stupid expensive weymo us lidar
people already forgetting drive bike car also rip motor skill
going hell lot people work taxi driver van driver hgv driver would liked least comment dark side development give piece balance
universal basic income must face fact time coming everyone work order meet need another philosophy needed
learn code
issue increasingly limiting thing people like even dont like driving doesnt mean people dont enjoy utopia people envision future human driver thats everyone want
aside disability want driverless car go bus driverless car take away whole point car
else noticed changed video title
wait taxi driver strike
cant wait driverless car networked together communicating swarm ai driverless car oh mass adoption would great course
driverless car great wonderful moment whole lot hacked time caused crash
imagine still result far le death car monkey behind wheel
agree key risk need managed appropriate control need place mitigate risk flip side autopilot safely used aero industry many decade internet thing iot connectivity creates many opportunity hacker driverless car industry need demonstrate theyve managed risk appropriately
itll going work indiathis car circuit blow stuck indian traffic
ask bad weather shill
people forgiving towards people machine
thats true extent always seems road rage happen driver know there human behind wheel
way trust machine human
derek avid pilot believe underestimated pilot inside jet aircraft definition plane could monitored ground would need pilot would flying plane vfr visual flight rule also higher trained pilot use called ifr instrument flight rule pilot doesnt need anything outside main instrument radio fly land plane effectively one bad apple lot hundred thousand pilot fly daily p hacking flying fact
rwoooosh
something tell guy isnt avid pilot cant put autonomous finger

makosb good question didnt even think
waymo safer tesla
well new paradox born helmet paradox
even motorcycle example bad argument human may choose shoulder road
amount people dont know blind people type demonic angel comment insane jesus christ use audio get assistant probably
million emplacement
might even say waymo experience human driver
oh god
win
waymo contacting shortly
well done
nice pun
fantasy reality kid stand front fun wont move busy area bangkok eg need taxi driver hustle beep etc easy stop rob occupant crawl busy traffic quicker walking think monorail infrastructure already ok wealthy extremely dence area crowded city town real world self driving limousine rest terrible idea thanks
love driving car
imagine slow driver occupying space car gone
nice video got kick seeing tour around place close home
jackass phone driving
time smartphone
example given onesided plenty example human needed computer didnt work right qantas flight example locking control pilot going haywire life board computer getting false reading sensor dont get wrong would accept robot overlord shouldnt sugar coat giving human ability take matter stupid give u sense security needed
excellent example plus emergency situation british airway flight would completely automated plane dealt engine flaming hand ive watched enough mayday episode clearly show majority crash related type pilot error horrific tenerife airport disaster air france prime example know without doubt air travel much safer road travel always try think good example airmanship v bad example whenever fly
sure technology possible think main issue cost since people still drive manual rather automatic half europe due cheaper cost ex communist country even relatively rich country like finland
car computer controlled id completely comfortable computer going deal thing people much harder
everybody gangsta till internet pack exhaust server connection lost highway
drive phoenix venice beach orlando fl tusayan az
many driver gon na lose job becomes thing
year adapt new technology known worked least past thats enough find new job dont know else need
point might well replace human robot field entirely haha
want know autonomous f car would let say lewis hamilton silverstone like seriously think would interesting test system qualifying mode track within certain parameter temperature moisture single racing line basically traffic worry
really amazing like itwow
think fantastic idea sure cope road marking arent perfect
love phd nothing
one hand know widespread even complete adoption driverless car way go hand really like driving
youre luck maybe kid wont
still going kill people guy ready sure lol liability car culture rejecting driverless vehicle definately shape future crap fight right drive tracking
best driverlrss human driver arent factor car communicate directly road
shouldnt mix different driver type
great topic completely agree however also think need attention paid many many people lose job next decade technology driving job entry level job great young people newlyarrived immigrant least u people ummminteresting personal background also one flexible type employment put people work society need either come way make work start thinking minimum wage universal basic income
driverless technology work except doesnt youre passenger may observe making serious error
poorly researched video literally advertisement waymo several serious fatal accident autonomous driving uber tesla autonomous driving statement autonomous driving safe wrong obviously wrong neutral honest plainly hiding con autonomous driving good gain trust people
car wont last day jakarta monday morning
truth human make way mistake machine difference there mistake blame individual make feel emotional release yell machine like idiotand still usually machine occur error due human action
people stupid driving vietnamese learned hard way
pedestrian also robot one day global safety
put uber driver others alike business car drive wherever leave pick text slowly surely technology replace job people think bad thing could could good thing change system every human instead robot worker place making income depends rule future game well playing
waymo explicitly told mention tesla add clip
ulu zulu ah yes course
tesla reason people still think av still infancy one reason tesla bad domain refuse adopt lidar radar necessary technology make car look ugly many fatality car driving uber took seriously enough shut project rest tesla want footage crash footage tesla way waymo asked derek add clip tesla clip begin
shadowebeb two camera two microphone sensor worked pretty well far
marcfrank worst la vega convention center dont even trust technology closed loop year ago drove self driving car masdar city near abu dhabi closed loop worked well tesla far even level total joke
tesla disgrace autonomous car advertise autonomous even close
driving something many people fun hobby love
still able decade driverless car different use case
still year away internationally even europe even technology red tape paper work become fully legal pilotless plain terrifying want pilot even dont anything computer glitch happy combination technology human tesla autonomous driving good activated driver driver sake system make sure driver still awake ready take computer malfunction also wont take people enjoy driving drive fun get b never see day ever everyone drive autonomous car also cant compare unmanned lift autonomous car lift move right floor told isnt making thousand calculation every second perfect avoid accident lot chance thing go wrong overall want fully autonomous car want law tesla system put driver telling car concentrating lastly accident happen accident even computer avoid crash computer responsible crash doesnt sit right
agree drive vote system similar modern aircraft autopilot system using expert system something human take emergency control
think human never professional truck driver ive seen accident happen many similar accident truck traveling u highway suddenly encounter flock sheep highway swerve even though house side highway lock brake drive yeah human didnt make correct decision cost life codriver wife doubt expert system could make correct decision either many variable calculate split second scenario included program yeah know faster computer decision muscle memory instinct expert system neither
car see foot meter cant remember ahead itselfand side saw flock sheep hour ago started slowing muscle memory reaching another fresh fry
also per enewautomotive child run onto road take average second human driver hit brake autonomous vehicle equipped radar lidar sensor camera system reaction time second yea trust car man better u
whole thing expert system actually integrate million experience vehicle fleet make decision real world soon tell u system human prove capable individual answer may different statistical one
f making driverless car improve public transport know u funded bill say like though
hey derek im glad see youre helping waymo let tell much right selfdriving car get seattle ill tell would one first one ride one thing im legally blind blind nothing basically tell car go bottom line though need design app people blind partially sighted people navigate app way people like actually kill driverless car go basically help get away public transportation possibly change way get around
survive road mumbai many people convinced
city oriented towards pedestrian selfdriving car make likely space city get taken car disincentive drive first place

ingramfry thats exactly point there enough research pointing america excess space wasted parking especially urban area correlated sorta racist road expansion excludionary zoning practice parking requirement subsidids associated bn cost annually even arent necessary u decade car culture forced excess parking part problem problem need solved parking subsidy likely enforced w policymakers given ev introduced even parking expensive high carbon footprint overall inefficient use space go developed country like netherlands japan dont give parking like necessity supposed treated privilege transit oriented development decongests city self driving car likely enable mechanism take away transitwalkableoriented development powerful tool prevent congestion theyre controversial planning perspective
question road eventually full autonomous car radiating lidar wave wont reading interfere
like wifi different channel maybe lidar working different wavelength intensity channel wonder
doesnt work like even though laser interfere others sensor wont make difference lidar image everything range difficult lidar draw image lidar secondly two car come near lidar type sensor many around car error reading lidar sensor around car rectify data frame making car take right decision situation develop work autonomous car assure interference sensor car manage software fed autonomous car go day training acquire data car drive safely error one sensor
well need car everyone blind laser painting road
problem even cheap dollar lidar resistant outside noise facing output one directly sensor another return reading match timing frequency large part due need lidar reject daylight laser emits frequency infrared range without mitigation technique sun would drown return signal bad would never see anything foot biggest thing lidar fail outside noise simply loose one dot modern lidar run k million hz meaning thousand million dot per second data coming interference would bad enough lose thousand dot per second many second order prevent system functioning
janeblogs wont happen either lidar emit low power infra red laser wont affect eyesight cause health issue even iphone us lidar camera sensor dose cause blindness absolutely lidar safe every car general pas quality safety check entering public road test result verified transport road safety department
please kill obsession car already invention mistake need walkable city bike path better mass transit stop killing planet driving obesity rate never driven car never even owned license first year independence walkable city great bike infrastructure ive never happier lost weight feel healthy stop appreciate nature local architecture commute ever saw driver know stress frustration road rage im never going let wallet drain

yeah getting used driverless car getting used elevator without attendant lmao
must crazy server go
ive always proautonomouscars even though love driving many idiot road also driving traffic jam suck
everyone wanted flying car driverless car
technology cool legal implication mean autonomous car hit somebody fault responsible im ready curious country traffic fatality usually go jail get diver license revoked prohibited retake many year released prison know happen thousand road even best redundant computer sometimes error fault crash network error lag sesnor errorconflict etc simply bad decision made ernest based data available time say law nobody fault insurance compensate victim family problem proportionality meeting road fatality even resolted human driver treated driver fault insurance pay victim family driver get free drive next day

driverless car careless driver
people trust human driver prone many kind distraction far le experienced whether car public transport
people take driving test fail average driver nbd
take away car dont need driver need pilot
every time airplane crash human error regulator ask better rigorous training car driver would wrong people would hundred hour behind wheel get permit would mean would get rid stupid people driving translate traffic jam anymore thus making autonomous car solution inexistent problem say need get rid stupid people important thing asap
really love driving really cant justify human driving least city wellmaintained road autonomous vehicle level exist ruralundeveloped region might another story
yes advertising waymo really mean sais trust dereks opinion
motorcycle rider cant count number time almost wrecked reckless driver number people told story rider seriously hurt killed reckless driver autonomous car would make motorcycling much safer would mean people riding bike scooter thats important motorcycle get great fuel mileage take little room highway parking lot great acceleration mean bike equal le stop go traffic vehicle big truck stopped engine idling faster commute better mental health around
eyeroll said subsurban place arizona wont biggest challenge autonomous car look im engineer experience research area happening long time honest wasting money putting ton research autonomous vehicle fact research show almost people u wont interested enjoy driving car anyways back autonomous far many variable whenever come driving car calculate scenario night cant see well unless used expensive equipment algorithm even shoddy ready pay people wont type essay ieee lot article stuff people read using money rigorous system learning drive honestly joke u
would horrific hacked
time ran someone crossing road night lol nothing okay ad man
ok please dont get rid parking lot would insane youre basically mandating everybody pay double gas since car drive store back house store back house either want car circle entire time im store waste even gas maybe im delivery driver really care wear tear gas mileage
three case waymo vehicle stationary pedestrian ran vehicle report kindly omits intoxication level pedestrian
next driverless pedestrian
maulerrw sound like drunk people already
maybe car stop immediately infront think detail needed get picture happened
actually intoxicated
paulmichaelfreedman maybe scammer trying get cash waymo mobile atm

one doubt happen two driverless car coming close head head side side direction towards one another stop forever seems stop see obstacle mean driverless car see one another obstacle managed dont know question clear someone know answer please let know
public transport prioritisation city made people car automation come faster
im still better driver system tho
time switch fully autonomous vehicle fact yall vehicle vehicle communication approved nhtsa traffic problem human coordination autonomous vehicle roadway would eliminate need traffic light

solution problem car isnt electric car autonomous car type car stop overreliance car build better public transport course automotive industry lobby keep pumping car instead
eww public transportation
also first thought seeing video title even sensor piloting system car free theyd still expensive operate city bus system extra space taken road smaller le efficient engine individual thing maintain
maybe ability control give feeling safety compared machine people good control something extreme condition big red stop button give ability stop something bad happening maybe software bug make u feel safe

first autonomous car exist south korea like government ignore dont make commercial sell sad
autonomous car would great idea accident sure lot le billion accidentsyear however rely wont long rely autonomous aircraft drone even weapon im worried software security hacker always try hack especially bad actor ai gone bad
agree tech pretty much think real hold establishing legal framework handling mishap however rare may whilst autopilot used
hate driving passion remove life
goal increase skeptic belief still way go didnt great job addressing concern might barely mentioned weather poor infrastructure sure would reasonable confidence today autonomous vehicle driving sunny weather smooth road considering ive worked radar electronics harsh weather condition know challenge pose even detection system used traffic lightsyou got ta show handle flash flood blizzard convince almost ya elevator comparison really fair dont even worry collision elevator lol ya brake really harsh would hope prediction would done way gradual brake stop instead human might go might human show sudden brake like emergency compensate failure anticipation wake call
also going point good driver need anticipate bad driver saying vehicle failed someone else broke rule isnt good enough exception might arguably case car stationary even might depend car could reasonably moved way prevent accident didnt thats failure
ive thought driverless car year figured company like waymo wouldnt put car road risk getting living crap sued due safety concern people like underestimate computer overestimate malice company like uber new york taxi service switch fleet autonomous vehicle safety record garbage itd ruin heartbeat would lose public trust theyd also sued passenger also government would prevent operating ever pretty significant risk say well let chuck bunch goodenough car road paying inevitable ding cost le paying actual driver
like idea elevator driver going strike like theyre going stop job people use automatic one prof arent needed lol
good luck fighting car dealership repair lobby

wonder driveless car earthquake pop would deal situation
everything fine self driving buddy loses coordinate god forbid kid hack
map probably downloaded computer doubt would ever loose gps signal security concern though
lot benefit also unintended consequence owned fully autonomous car would instruct drive car park pay parking would tell drop front door go home drive around block waiting would increase traffic reduce pedestrian confident get run walk traffic example dense city area slow speed limit lot people around enough make confident get worse blocking traffic freeing ive driven lot truck people constantly jump safety marginstopping space autonomous truck slow never get anywhere many benefit mentioned realising full value car drive ride sharing like taxi uber autonomous car benefit tech great utopian people present could well much better without problem
trusting driverless car one thing safeguard human messing car see would respond could totally imagine bozo taking tik tok jinking steering wheel see car would
wow infomercial waymo channel used educational channel dirty
ive saying forever
wait oh god give westworld season dont care million death
im driverless car blanket adopted solution mean people even le likely ever adopt walkable bikeable city problem car driving everywhere isnt driver car
big issue individual autonomous vehicle function safely issue could prevent bad actor hacking vehicle network crashing million car one another sport ransom powerless prevent cyber attack would different
autodriving really advanced safe dont understand tesla car many issue china
love video make parallel elevator strike go show uber replace every single one driver soon legal hooray robotic scab
wan na drive car
would nice get answer instead hype piece like area manually marked nogo waymo know car manage common stoppage car stop handle situation entire fleet ever get grounded eg due weather condition
waymo ranover pedestrian tempe last year
guess driverless driver actually us human teach drive service popular rd world country pay people identify object scanned lidar lidar doesnt know see company outsource cheap labor teach machine think even captchas asks u select picture stuff used
really disappointing company promising least level autopilot get investment musk recently admitted advanced autopilot much difficult though originally google pilot project video expensive run taxi service level autopilot year away passenger vehicle
keep imagining robber coming siren pulling automatically lol
would walk front car intersection rob since car wouldnt go run someone youd sitting waiting robbed
never thought lol need like irobot manual override thing steering wheel pop
car would stay locked tho probably call police window get smashed
thenips yea pointing gun car sitting thats going good time
thenips yeah window would broken police would called would robbed robber would leave police would arrive find robbed dead
driverless uber horizon
future kid grow driverless car taking anywhere want hey jonny youre old enough get licence hell would errr done
weirder feeling trusting driverless car knowing gen z may part one last generation actually learn drive
man cant drive cant wait driverless car
subscribe ridiotsincars driverless car
wonder better alphazero approach let car drive simulation like one hundred quintillion km tell car fuck programme fewest mess ups possible rinse repeat learns
tesla hold autopilot
driverless car dont scare everyone else road driving kuwait last month show bad driver maintaining lane speed limit distracted real problem
say human worst technologie agree realise unfortunatly become dumper use unless work self developpe sens everything u nothing gon na change
said cant wait doesnt drive work work company cant already use autonomous car also driving arizona thing weather different driving place still think year away becoming mainstream happy see progressing long dont steal government funding public transit im happy
think way thinking youre average driver good mindset assume everyone else road pedestrian path idiot youre careful prepared unexpected event dont think necessarily way though admittedly way human ignorance hubris also autonomous vehicle part solution along transit urban planning factor never forget
think moon landing tech mean go anytime least year expensive complicated require much human work correcting error etc also liability problem also keep perfect condition work sure take year ubiquitous
nonmotorized user nmu interaction explored lot would bad driverless car existence creates resistance carless nmudominated environment one interaction resulted practically emergency stop wish seen city lot nmu movement higher nmu density
interesting see cyber attack effect kind system sad true fact people attack service
think one legitimate topic concern nobody talk concerned completely unlikely computer trolley problem said considering many life could saved technology still think would much worth assuming technology proven secure enough
think hardest part accept driverless car would one act immediate circumstance terminate program vehicle became unsafe isnt adding feature nullify concern though whether company begin use end people charge properly maintain vehicle andor use system bypass tricking system thinking problem car would fixed even higher safety standard im realizing problem would stem entirely human damn bad job lmao
evelyn yo check vid almost intersection crosswalk light whih would llow use brain theyd obviously stop pedestrian esignated crosswalk suddem case appearance best ability
oh come youre giving enough credit say year max
gon na anime future protagonist dream becoming driver age driverless car meet veteran learn call himher sensei
gud idea mate
wireshark sharkfest conference singapore grahamb core developer changed mind self driving car said year cited crash blank billboard etc graham said drove car wo seatbelt wo crumple zone wo air bag wo ab brake etc car certainly got safer one waited safer start driving know point
think something else kind said choice car self driving car reasonable boring commuter likely inspected frequently people often choose car absurd horsepower legally use control
call old fashion something give bad feeling
seriously compare elevator move z direction full autonomous vehemently

taxi driver find new job like elevator driver
yeah let automate everything point bullshting people internet job left
detect speeding object take safe move stop according
im truck driver tell honestly one better driver road lol see many bad driver would totally go ride one self driving car
issue argument responsibility autonomy firstly take responsibility accident second choose accident choose distracted would use autonomous vehicle better average human better situation first argument still persists
everyone autonomous car camera would privacy soon follow issue
actually videogames quite evolved ai year expanding autonomous device quite easy actual issue ability shift real world data fast enough allow computer make decision technology still issue performing ocr image accurately given continuous data stream algorithm dsp need fast enough shift realtime low error rate
pedestrian running stationary vehicle face priceless
almost like suppressed pogchamp lol
derek way much techfanboy even offering critical thought car doubt always err side caution tend violate reasonable expectation especially lowspeed situation remember sudden hard stop parking lot easily imagine pedestrian got expectation car movement suddenly betrayed instead slipping past behind walking car car constantly predict surroundings exactly time different way
felixfranz understand however adapt car road easily recognizable im sure thing much issue anymore still think worth tradeoff thousand deadly incident year v minor injury low speed bump stationary vehicle
felixfranz maybe solution pedestrian shouldnt walk moving traffic idk maybe thats bit crazy idea work
felixfranz im struggling actually picture scenario pedestrian expects pas behind car car instead stop pedestrian slam car enough force cause injury course would still human error pedestrian paying enough attention road walk car feel lucky walked autonomous one didnt get run human controlled one think part hypey tone vid due frustration people attitude toward autonomous tech human driven car continue one dangerous element life main transportation method cycling almost getting run driver paying attention daily occurrence life point im pretty sure reason im injured dead many modern car automatically brake avoid type collision oh also dont think sudden brake unreasonable pedestrian reach crosswalk car behind crosswalk car supposed stop thats reasonable expectation fact driver almost never actually unreasonable bit pedestrian feel much safer crossing street know human going try swerve around crosswalk
think collaboration tesla lol
autonomous car right already transportation option safe cheap much lower carbon footprint bus train reason company spending much money investing autonomous vehicle there way profit made sell rich people whereas bus train sell city city arent willing pay premium flashy cutting edge technology made car last mile solution back
work good condition technology year away still see value train billion people drive train one computer
main problem fully autonomous vehicle dont work situation like heavy snow ice need able control vehicle work situation normal driving keep practice bad stuff happens
tesla fsd beta work snow ice although isnt nearly good waymo yet
uoppsdnsu legitimately awesome get point trust car drive home snowstorm ill ready go driverless heartbeat
look lovely pedestrian
ha maybe stop light would reprogammed four direction turn red allow pedestrian crossing
people coming time machine past think car haunted
dont think mention asiana fair il wasnt functioning airport pilot land visually autopilot assisting pilot cause crash pilot transitioning airbus plane boeing flight first flight didnt forget leave throttle idle didnt fully understand behavior autopilot
subscription car service cost substantially car ownership coop push margin favor user dont see elons tunnel move people train
tesla approaching billion selfdriving mile driven
next going pay ai taxi fair wage work u human like treat device like crap going get uprising lifeforms certain level intelligence must given freedom without question
rita yo check vid disturbing coder making ai day understand say abused talk horny people human reading terrified
title change driverless car already current one
thought technology year issue legality insurance stuff ironed who liable accident person back seat owner car company make driving software seems easy sort imagine legalese mumbo jumbo involved figuring also mass transit already exists major city already leave commute someone else public bus train kinda filthy spill wrapper stinky human stinky whew issue vision publicly owned driverless car future
dont even like automatic transmission would want automatic car
march got accident buy new car new car ford fusion titanium lane assist used feature rental bought car key feature buying new car well heavy rain one day highway limited visibility foot couldnt see tail light car front adaptive cruise control could still see car ahead keeping distance check couldnt see lane marker beside lane assist kept line reality complex system super useful aid u quicker react takeaway feature likely saved getting another accident thus likely saved life fully autonomous vehicle designed correctly feel greatly improve safety road
driver believe theyre average population dy car crash math add
soooooo ready fully autonomous vehicle
critical safety point self drive better average driver critical safety point better worst driver thats life saved another important point veritasium make type ai prediction prediction cone broken there lot machine stop crashing stuff self drive car choosing hit avoid essentially fantasy reason type ethic become problem true strong ai asimov law type problem start occur moral maze design maze surrounding make self driving car look easy
whats backup lidar humidity high raining
think software become perfect work indian road
one interesting tidbit regarding autopilot taught navycould scuttlebutt like think true regarding f older aircraft carrier long ago aircraft carrier still wooden deck f autopilot good landing place starting damaging wooden flight deck exact spot plane touched every time introduce slight variability landing zone counteract
main concern malicious actor hacking car various reason
indian road
cyclist cant wait fully autonomous automobile
wouldnt mind riding driverless car wouldnt want one company make accepts responsibility accident car driving
testing phoenix start many year take car learn drive snow low visibility
stalled pheonix year turn whole self driving thing alot harder tech bros said computer work great sanitary condition list rule follow perfectly real world isnt clean messy complicated requires human judgment
tested car place like india thailand others asia middle east gon na cut put car perfect condition real test occur already tried test place pas audit would want buy one rate better hope something apple car
tincan useless inclement weather storm hazardous situation etc u go ahead trust
yup im sure u also beg airplane pilot turn auto landing storm wont
fdsajklre careful lack education showing
georgehoward sorry sir didnt know im talking mind reader determine lowly level education rightaway witty insightful reply im sure u must atleast phd youtube comentary mind reading allow explain comment would appreciate much see video discussing moment narrator describes bad weather could make impossible human land plane safely however push button enable auto landing impossible thing happen plane landed safely according educated opinion bad weather bane autopilot pilot condemns hundred soul aboard oblivion merely point small contradictable point wise opinion stupid narrator relatively uneducated evidence shown video know opinion came endlessly educated source video need shut airplane autopilot must scraped right away safety mankind may forgive transgression little false logic human great day sir
india see driver le car run road india thought oooo ghost
lol rubberneck slow see main reason traffic first place
thats gay gay one asked
happens run gas
great waymo ad stage better monitored car lidar instead fsd tech ready yet
worry snow rain ice people like cause trouble
far im concerned technology basically ready infrastructure need major work
think unknown risk factor million vehicle technology spewing radiation time tell
ismaelochoa radiation like ir hmm super dangerous take physic class babe
jaketaylor like get tesla
ismaelochoa risk im aware damage human eye camera depends wavelength lidar whether unit good filter
ismaelochoa modern way life built back electromagnetic radiation overair radio television radio wave mobile phone service wifi microwave yes kind cook food except one emitted microwave appliance much much stronger one emitted mobile phone tower wireless router antenna wireless remote mixture infrared radio wave light allows u see form electromagnetic radiation radiation allows u view bone internal structure via xray imaging form electromagnetic radiation sun vomiting electromagnetic radiation million time stronger concentrated anything weve ever produced life spectrum constantly bombarded electromagnetic radiation rest space radiation buzzword thats used incite fear ignorant reality there multiple type radiation harmful either exist natural part universe extremely useful u handled properly id highly recommend looking electromagnetic radiation role play modern life rather blindly believing anything word radiation dangerous must avoided cost
imagine street full autonomous car suddenly pulling side og road someone playing loud music siren
point think police car firetrucks ambulance would autonomous would communicate car need pull
noobyoverlord b bike anyone isnt car
tompatterson since pull police bike theyre driving
id loooove see working mexico google engineer make work would ready
really ethical saving life would otherwise killed human error little bit messy ethic overpopulation dont want end system like china population control law personally feel outcome inevitable given appropriate span time
imagine there glitch software two car road rage suddenly stop make fist fightbut there driver
theyre racing compute pi million digit settle dispute
unfortunately drive known road specific trip
one point know computer glitch happen
would trust ai vehicle people u road
everyone know green screened guy driving dont trust car
love tech let cover environment white snow
look forward car driverless wish could afford one day
many dislike lol
riding elevator never much fun driving hella fun many people dont drive anymore still remember much fun especially manual thats overcome visceral feeling controlling incredible speed average person feel every day giving may need separate road
good thing tesla taking radar called full selfdriving car
ok thought maybe human average driver discussion safety could average mean perhaps something like caused le fair share road death serious traffic accident say resulting injury requiring medical attention million serious injury traffic accident u let say accident involving average two injury thats maybe million serious traffic accident million licensed driver u thats around driver causing serious injury driving year average driver responsible serious traffic accident people cause le serious traffic accident american driver safer average driver given year
make every driverless car connect car turn lane croos road lighting speed
thats better title
dont completely distrust self driving car dont trust
come india see real driver
wonder difficult would hack vehicle also wonder difficult would defeattrick lidar sensor cause vehicle get accident compared could human cant simulate creative bad actor trying defeat system
would love driverless car adhd self driving make neurotic mess extra stimulation fear concentrating important ala poor unistudent
im extremely anxious would definitely love use driverless car
uber driver say im fan autonomous vehicle live drive make good living dont take away living im random driver take driving seriously dont take away
theyre probably great city happens drive truck country city pick material though also happens snow line covered want see solution
dont think driverless vehicle freerange public highway ever truly safe form transportation safer completely safe guarantee high level safety reliability would need controlled environment vehicle operated using technology difficulty designing manufacturing ai necessary anticipate compensate operate road environment filled human wide wide breadth skill perception intelligence emotion health ability ego every thing effecting human perception world simply impossible different level automation given different system spotlight difficulty automobile manufacture spent last century making car better better designing loose nut behind wheel proved time time impossibility therein lie problem mentioned automation aircraft something actually quite familiar question modern autopilot system typically operate aircraft better smoother pilot operating low weather condition aircraft operated mile foot aircraft airspace environment closely monitored much different congested hectic city street environment particularly true flying cat iii approach yet even automation aircraft still crash occasion spot comment becoming worse driver partly due distraction might add partly due overreliance automation computerization case point asiana airline crash debacle partly due overreliance automation crew thought autothrottles engaged case pilot becoming le competent due automation real concern industry think ideal place ai automobile separate road track system keep away separate vehicle human driver doubt society build system cant argue technology would likely reduce collision getting loose nut behind wheel cant hurt accident statistic technology developed interesting without doubt dont think ever panacea believe think trepidation getting driverless vehicle likely instinct live kicking telling whoa fast danger

investment public transportation best way fight traffic climate change
best driverless car train bus pedestrian walkway
hi live fly state let walk work since bus train service hmm hour walk bad
currently exactly wouldnt super convenient bus train ran within walking distance thats reality rural area outside u weve decided city people access kind infrastructure ridiculous
klineaugust know expensive would bus would service rural area hourly much cheaper faster car go need go need go city bus work great live outside city car may best option car certainly best option bus would huge expense
honestly cant wait technology problem see machine taking wouldnt surprised type technological advancement lead large double digit unemployment driverless car also cashier cook waiter manufacturer etc used thing like universal income due lowering people drive innovation im starting believe government start looking taxing company dont use human job like service industry using tax universal income robot future best u society need address unemployment crisis follow doubt people actually see comment id love hear everyones opinion
cant wait human driver road
driverless car road safer theyll ai doesnt know asshole cut texting
america always reserve right unnecessarily put people danger freedom price
agree thing except one going reduce traffic rebound effect mean people stop using mass transit altogether everybody switch individual ride traffic bad ever
imagine cop pulling driverless vehicle thought speeding running stop sign like even situation
dont think car speed run stop sign though thats kind point
connorcoultas hence said thought
comparison far reality driving close proximity people plane sky elevator thing dont get something go wrong person blame know happened something go wrong computer blame outcome harder reconcile mean alot video feel sponsored youre following positive
unlikely people could aboveaverage driver example let say gave driver score score average driving score would get daily pedantic ask think cool cool
yes ideal situation situation ideal situation ideal think reliable people average though
im totally fine fully autonomy come car love driving hope come hope accommodate
automated fleet used give ticket driver breaking traffic law
driverless advocate dont want commute work anymore pandemic got fam
imagine many people loose job stupid technology like
feel like big miss sure evaluate aggregate like derek doesnt matter trillion simulated drive human driver infer dangerous situation based much le experience apply quickly especially come stupid driver may present hazard constantly evaluate whether driver behaving recklessly possibly drunk back way car infer residential street may speed limit high given sight line lidar technology function flawlessly car road would expected critical analysis veritasium human driver handle novel situation even problem alludes car software isnt better best human driver mean truly average safe driving skill mathematically step safety talk acknowledgement want force bad driver use autonomous vehicle guest want take away steering wheel better way better driving yah mean instead brake checking everyone pedestrian who cross walk look like marked speed bump who near vehicle smooth slow
bro best human driver worse ai car bad driver thats proven course problem new situation car safety program start sich case
able react new situation yes usually fast mean hit something someone experience anticipation something good prevent u situation he talking average joe replaced average joe aware driver likely distracted even make analysis ahead himher therefore ai car much safer general
thought waymon car bad didnt know many unnecessary camera tesla thing camera
great instead greater infrastructure mass public trasportation carstaxis without driver ocupping place road
truck wouldnt isekai people anymore magic truck driver

talking automation airplane sensor provide visual cue pilot aligns plane becomes easy machinery take control rest procedure dont know needed compare automatic driving road many variable
mean really cool tech cool stopgap shouldnt see autonomous car end game still problem car going fix transit good public transit need nation wide version shinkansen bullet train interstate travel need pedestrian train focused city rather focusing car
sherri tap sex problem autonomous car car general isnt safety inefficiency take much space move people effective going forward average car move people per vehicle space three car typically move train car train bus light rail solution going emphasized going forward want feasibility energy consumption manufacturing fewer bigger battery requires le material le processing million car
hacked
hope soon manufacturer fully automated car offer unlimited liability cover standard feature car instead suspect lobby government pas law indemnify injury loss caused malfunction
cant wait australia fully support viewpoint reduce accident contrary belief people accident increase due autonomous vehicle im glad derek pointed human error primary cause motor vehicle accident many people drive recklessly take risk one thing didnt hear mentioned human emotion tend cloud judgment critical situation mother careful driver highly susceptible panic anything unexpected happened doesnt happen machine case ive never driver licence depth perception poor even though see clearly cant judge distance well adequately gauge speed direction nearby vehicle pedestrian never safe drive derek used comparison automatic elevator reference emerging technology fully autonomous vehicle however reminds something even older still earliest day railway trackside signal employeespolice giving hand signal clayton tunnel rail crash occurred one earliest rail block signal despite root cause human error people living time drew conclusion railway signal would actually increase accident instead reducing today know case hopefully generation well acceptance fully autonomous vehicle concern emerging technology job market economy happen people whose livelihood relies driving transport vehicle including container truck driverless future
tf asking
feel inappropriate video like veritasium informative explainer style actually ad understand paid promotion disclosed still sits wrong especially considering much information left didnt paint good picture waymo specifically feel controlling hand google creation video way would never acceptable typical veritasium video sponsored editorial content okay disappointed see regardless personal feeling self driving importance actually agree dereks google stance
based driverless car make decision would move road like jakarta
trained ai road jakarta probably would ace
safer human driver environment would obviously need way le cautious achieve jakarta fact plug old carmageddon ai youre probably still better
carmageddon second fuel every pedestrian car hit might work environmental initiative reduce carbon footprint growing population
need get place faster would possible tell car take risk
love technology idea driverless car issue assumed lack safety although extremely selfish want give driving love drive work want turn another mundane task excited driverless car excited inevitably take road
much trusting vehicle rather decision making process accordance expectation preference example decide parking space use big shopping complex might want park shaded area distance away vehicle
driverless car going destroy massive amount job technology amazing impact wont purely beneficial
persists say problem people afraid vehicle vehicle controlled others
ive waiting driverless car since first traffic jam welcome future
experience anyone loudly brag good driver always worst driver look comment section dudebros talking reaction time pfp riced little streetracer yah nah brah
didnt talk real concern didnt even touch biggest fear well recognize thing trully sponsored guess smh
great something hack system cause vehicle malfunction million die time decide threat plan tell car wreck decide mean
happens car crash cant open door safety test done mean trust aircraft technology rigorous testing standard safety testing self driving car
car driver happen
go offroading
nice see responsible ghost driver wearing seatbelt
disable annoying seatbelt alarm since car retrofitted
think usually chime doesnt sound unless seat someone
replacing human driver driverless car morally problematic
make sense
service available city id sell three ton steel car sitting garage use lee five time week
taxiis uber
see car working would get lot people get bored please let know much one car cost
thumbnajl
ordered tesla model lr part
im bit disappointed video coz dont talk flaw current state tech first analogy arent valid elevator system one elevator shaft airplane fly controlled environment road way chaotic lot room error wish youd talked vehicle handle poor visibility fog snow etc poorly maintained road guess expect objective analysis veritasium
im waiting become common ive got hour commute work straight flat highway could use nap time
imagine reliable train service like civilized country
thefrub cost effective yet rate texas almost larger france le half population cost lay rail across empty area almost one want go maintain people want pay time yes dense population area rail might feasible would use rail freight costeffective amount people would want travel would pay upkeep
bias trust new technology isnt necessarily bad thing bias forced aeroplane become one safest form transportation
car safety im worried
people love driving car geek huh people older age probably highly encouraged use automated automobile service opinion younger people take advanced driving test frequently per year drink drive could avoided using sensor detects driver stats driving know kinda weird using breathalyzer method analyze bac without physical contact lane assist obstacle warning etc compulsory
video sponsored waymo followed face man sold lol
technology put million people work
one step closer walle
imagine well traffic would flow car autonomous synchronized others position
thought piece plexiglas spider web first
criticizes men tiny hat car wont go
greta miriam yeah would afraid government could limit car use political reason say use excuse youre helping global warming
see need perhaps disabled really busying guy need time work need
havent gotten roadrage someone talking phone wise distracted
happens tire go flat
driveroperator like elevator yes matter going point b giving driving pleasure nah
well get rush something else driving track flying well find something else
felt nervous driverless vehicle reassured
data security record view street stored temporarily
mass j walker software would stop right pan handling extortion lol one stand front row car another demand amount move
though understand cool purpose self driving car one think business firing manpower favor robot get job done le time dont need breakscabs truck driver delivery eliminating drunk drivingwhich could eliminate people responsible eliminate driver error cause accidentsagain could eliminate people responsible
point people dont drive ever reason
mass public transit bus train subway etc would similar effect also drastically better environment fleet autonomous vehicle
accident involve human driver stupid thing whole video people always stupid thing im saying technology isnt yet im saying compatible people thing time people continue dumb cant changed driverless car still people drive like cause accident unless change big amount car driverless car accident still happen
driver getting worse driver assist tech pedestrian going get worse driverless car traffic slow half speed dose
best driver world selfdriving car pedestrian also learn cross street however selfdriving car detect act faster
speeding doesnt happen worse driver happens driver get confident
driverless car make le mistake react faster traffic caused slow reaction time people accelerate time road filled nothing driverless car thing would run several time smoother
obviously one read study showing driverless car pedestrian greater confidence car avoid hitting take greater risk pedestrian take risk car programming travel slower speed reduce risk collision feed back loop driverless car system ass safe speed le half current speed already seen two accident caused driver assist technology reacting taking account big picture new tech seeing woman reading news paper kph driving mercedes need decide who control vehicle people cant need stay road
davidreeves study link pls
every time hear misinformation aviation information presented way push point view without giving whole picture example fly approach il weather computer assistance ever die little inside pilot year experience
happens million road pick stray lidar point cant see
watch adam somethings response cgps solution traffic
totally agree driverless car great far solution traffic long commute
also people watch bike channel
watched video russian propaganda feel like
elderhet never mind fact point match experience west he czech therefore must russian course
brettski think he hungarian yes think point match reality term carcentric city causing traffic public transit effective way mitigate
lead first game project worked killed car accident tesla autopilot however still wonder itll safer vehicle road driven computer one day
blind person seriously cant wait driverless car

good buddy
better autonomous public transportation solve last mile problem would surely reduce emission since one issue autonomous vehicle people may drive kind like two bird one stone
youre right future technology yet yes would instantly save life im future dont car simply cant handle situation people live doesnt mean specific individual safer sensor programming havent enough real world testing glitch bug code sensor failure computerized attack many variable yet enough data get right vehicle still struggle drive snow rain long hard road perfecting much like example pilot took crashed plane havent gotten rid pilot yet ultimately problem control feel like elevator perfect safe took decade technology perfected looking similar timeline prosecute driverless car run someone blame lawsuit people like accountability yes since people believe aboveaverage driver expect safer driving people never experience serious accident often prevent accident driving course think highly ability elevator plane much simpler boil obstacle neither avoid hitting people operation sensor get better coding become robust redundancy name game way ensure feel safe around isnt life put forth could save life letting computer feed instead choosing meal people wired play life safe passively get feel many circumstance would already use selfdriving car long way make work perfectly enough ultimately may take huge quick shift every car road selfdriving communicating crash vehicle would happen ever
looking personal vehicle ownership heading technology becomes commonplace personal ownership shrink priced market level safety feature autonomous vehicle include likely required human operated vehicle make sense placing beyond reach individual number developer already announced ownership offered subscription model clearly ownership merely upgraded bus pas hence people need additional selling get issue environmental point view electric offering great development could get used car guy consumer probably consider whether volunteering personal finance nickeled n dimed oblivion way forward subscription service never become cheaper add perceived value really successful business industry stranglehold entire economy like large bank internet company company already neck deep privacy transportation service based technology definitely bring road toll everywhere amazing cant wait aspect handing slice disposable income large business already know
upgrading car driverless would cool wont need driver join uber give car uber lease thats profit
whats going happen destroy earning ability andor economy point uber car expensive
here thing mate think dont trust robot think dont trust something cant blame someone thats think least
dont want commute work want sit backseat watch movie sleep basically want public transport doesnt suck easier way giving every single person selfcontained train building way way train lot leg room youre build lot safe bike route bus route tram walking path subway might even get exercise way car suck selfdriving car suck slightly le
please visit country sl wan na see experience beautiful ballet driving
think awesome im also people love driving dont think people car driving manually isnt going away easily
thank want least responsibility possible life
thats trippy
interesting video like idea car future driver computer im pretty sure accident reduced least half maybe forgot important detail people lot people use bike love drive love go highway kmh difficult convince people left steering wheel maybe future generation understand till today old fashioned people drive let computer take place
would work road sharp curve around cliff cant see car coming edge foot away line
human handle slowing ensuring reaction time enough compensate car coming around corner simply matter execution computer much better human like computer le information human mainly relying sight maybe sound
id trust car id hard time trusting previous occupant car unless regular inspection hygiene vandalism etc
image one vehicle family take work get kid school take grandma doctor going one thing life efficient
biggest problem nothing driving road accident biggest problem vandalism people sticking qr code advertisement car inside
think people worse driving fact automatic transmission vehicle there much operate vehicle hitting gas driving whereas manual transmission need physically change gear leaving occupied driver input actually move vehicle
really dont want society centred around car id rather society dont need car
someone drive ton cross country job site work cant wait day get driverless sprinter sleeping jamming paperwork back
fun fact find driver elevator today coit tower san francisco right wonder
team huge requires much people doesnt make sense look like people team car outside hire driver isnt easier
drive indian roadsthen green signal
youve got ta get across town five minute
damn hoping going releasing wake call video instead ad waymo truth driverless car lot farther people think waymo essentially cheat version one suburb phoenix map every inch operating area lidar accomplish previous driverless car test also done preplanned route knew car could succeed reality true driverless car proving much much harder people thought expert saying may never become widespread reality thinking transition society away car car terrible driverless created blighted urban sprawl landscape strip mall highway depressing make people fat pollutes environment need reconsider transportation build city
thank derek ive arguing year autonomous car dont perfect wont bethey better human im huge supporter technology becoming widely adopted cant wait happen im observant driver motorcyclist sheer number distracted driver today road horrifying cant fathom people get behind wheel effectively lb missile powered rapid explosion dont even try concentrate driving bad live even tell someone playing phone even getting close bring part robot revolution
shoutout skateboarder volunteered slam vehicle mph
clearly driver really really bad driver
imagine testing autonomous car programmed stay within geofenced area example real life autonomy take waymo geofenced zone utter chaos real danger everybody full self driving ai go anywhere without ridiculous load sensor waymo least mentioned video sponsored waymo sowhat trust report hmmmm
lot love cyclist pedestrian comment car driver perfect keep killing people worst pedestrian cyclist scratch paint dont kill user rarely
get least canada driving public road isnt right privilege really hope always privilege long im capable really enjoy driving
want everyone suburban urban area lining selfdriving car get discounted bus pas would save countless life environmental damage taxpayer money driverless car
one worry hacker cause car crash something security measure place
elevator operator driver moron
still tesla
cant wait autonomous vehicle
million mile wont even get across street india
think main issue human accept computer final say someone death make mistake let technology continue super advanced driver aid help driver avoid majority accident ultimately build control human control stop situation consider dangerous situation human still ultimately responsible accident sort justice one feel suing computer least know human mistake go jail said level driver aid would awesome human make mistake get angry behind wheel get drunk speed make time drive recklessly decision need make stopping rare computer accident maybe path forward
cant promote car cant even drive rain
road orwell
dont even need convince say driverless autonomous car im immediately board
driverless autonomous car
imagine automated car common disabled people one could use one wouldnt handicap parking one would walk half mile parking lot get mall instead special dropoff lane would created everyone would pull curb get get picked
really disappointing seeing much people dont want autonomous car thing never enough people first car never drive well drive rain becomes well drive kmhr wind heavy snowfall eventually becomes well cant navigate moral edgecase human literally solve agree recent space race new technology people say thing eventually die oldage forced use tech due external circumstance
honestly dont want selfdriving car enjoy driving fun low sport car taking point point b like always said journey destination
completely replace human driver would still require year
say
autonomous car v driver depend daily business
gease cross road suburb react
ban letting robot take job also would want car drive first place
happens vehicle stopped another car come great speed hit start avoid collision
issue trolley problem human cant solve time argue leisure never mind heat moment solvable therefore irrelevant
iiiiiiii dont know one hear trying fud laziness almost always long term detrimental consequence society every time hand control aspect life computer machine invariably come back kick u teeth city lost internet day due catastrophic accident primary junction got taken electrical storm took internet cellular even landline phone like people still offline although rare cost sum total nearly million dollar including actual cost restoring internet happen people could remember without ability communicate manufacturing facility shut police borderline useless primary communication system retail basically shut security system didnt work office complex emptied bank closed door couldnt get cash atm bad thing kept people going driving km internet driverless car would stopped well mean yes little concern internet fail like length time ransomware computer virus power failure smaller localized magnitude dont think le right way solve accident rate
lost full disclosure video sponsored waymo
year million mile gross overestimation driving year put well million mile road granted always drive work getting client house provide various service like landscaping construction
grandpa brought good point printing press invented human manually copied book one one printing press invented strike people copied book living threatening job sometimes great invention cost job thats go job lost one area must create job another area balance im excited future autonomous car
way car automation truly become safest driverless car communicate knowing every car location road say goodbye junction traffic light
cant wait see easy thing attack security kind perspective ml break fast model challenged manipulated
yeah instantly thought play sound siren annoy people
headshot connect emergency vehicle google map type service car keep track location time car arent relying sound detect problem solved
chloelol ehh ever tried using google map try locate someone large parking lot think technology might still imprecise
headshot making false road design order carjack
guess lidar based would much resistant video one
im new tech kinda want still drive car
mega parking lot get turned track think keicar hayabusa engine youre
derek telling u instance accident pedestrian looking camera like shouldnt even allowed walk
would feel safe without driver car go building armed security guard elevator driver first couple time wierd
concern self driving vehicle handle stupid people around work well sound like say sign
yes would big reduction waste nobody owned car rented thing recent event social medium anything go ability get around entirely mercy company interpretation character think well multiple company choose wont ban word alex jones
organ donor list drastically reduced future
tesla vision based fsd intriguing
want see ton driverless car big city would personally ride driverless taxi think people big city assume theyll work everywhere everything time absolutely live somewhere rural modicum tech savvy look video imagine six way sunday tech wont work average people dont commute concrete driveway concrete parking structure concrete road job take place like construction site farm field even gasp gravel road fancy garbage going fall flat face know theyll pushing legislation ban human driver save one child must something
ad veritasium google shill
car
internet thing going love
pretty sure anyone born wont ever need get driving license
choice driverless car humandriven car yes absolutely driverless best choice reason outline video thats false dichotomy car terribly inefficient way transporting people term space require environmental impact even theyre electric society really putting effort improving public transport encouraging cycling walking yes role autonomous car simply changing driverless car society really missing bigger issue
computer crash sometimes
may good idea get driverless car certification road road doesnt meet requirement certified painted line pothole kerb etc driverless car wont work would encourage much higher standard road everyone hopefully make safer driverless car car driver additionally ive thought might good idea smart cat eye reflector road could unique id thats read car looked super accurate position database compliment gps could read confirmed car reading allow car know exactly even snow etc wouldnt need powered operate nfc something similar
autonomous formula like
wait ride car like one take track race gokarts similar
ive always wondered vehicle tested lessthanideal condition well dirt road rainy day bumpy road road poor signage extremely busy intersection etc happens sensor fail say insect hit camera
damn tester waymo grazzed huge oversight destroy future
think million mile real world road driving ever worked best weather bit talking plane landing fog bad pilot couldnt see anything eye clever thing never able work well detector others thing make point offroad driving rain computer would far superior every sense human human way measure side slip loss grip tyre number thing system right sensor
pegasustedgive evidence film car performing bad condition simple
would love world get point car electric self driving could drive communicate even safer driving
believe skeptism towards fully automated vehicle especially plane warranted two boeing max plane crashed semiautonomous piloting
due boeing failing update manual educate pilot one particular subsystem plane subsystem communicating pilot well enough much usability education issue technical problem
said car us gas pump didnt realize car money
learning good driver one year experience realise ideal good driver
interesting become prevalent id bet might kind subscription service schedule ride advance work schedule something like scheduled ride car could build predicted route something
exciting video
ill never self driving car like driving thats drive manual transmission automatic make feel like car driving drive manual drive car im complete control wouldnt trust computer life
agree much thats said human driver far dangerous lvl autonomous car really hope video help people side selfdriving vehicle awesome stuff derek
driverless car make eye contact try cross street accept driverless car chance
watching video im whole world confident get waymo
plan million people lose job transportation becomes automated promise probably dont want driverless car
definitely support driverless car concern hold icy road
given enough trainment better human could ai perform unintuitive steering slippery road based input friction value tire ground making better decision way easier matter theyll trained
begin manufacturer set security speed limit based outside temperature even normal situation theyre speeding
affews good point let hope upcoming driverless car company service wont put cheap tire average car part state art ai
thanks video believe better average correct mode
think straight elevator plane lot le hairy car plane need professional pilot already use radar etc tell every much properly trained pilot exactly altitude theyre flying people air open pretty much plane know isnt close hitting building ground youre good get back flying something bad happens autonomous car world point even close imo canada road get ruined quickly line missing harsh winter sometimes zero line visible snow cover etc even car lane keep assist although basic soon line good freak bad situation autonomous car would need learn drive purely based without line road able dodge bad driver people really dangerous situation time autonomous car city two state testing ground doesnt sound like ready worldwide use im excited come
think issue automated car people project ethic behaviour onto software come hypothetical trolley question believe would personally make best decision likely would panic make worst decision biggest obstacle driverless car human like saw parking lot pedestrian trolley charged ahead assuming car would stop road number people paying attention swerving speeding etc
literally saw autonomous car wayno run red light today
yeah id believe worth noting bad weather wasnt topic covered video could see rain snow might able frick ladar
real fun control unit car get hacked start dancing
well title autonomous car better normal one something like actually want le car street general horribly inefficient bad environment even electronic one
yeah electronic self driving one replace dangerous polluting one
think easy way convince get driverless car asking would feel way jumping car human driver dont know anything driving skill another aspect wasnt mentioned majority driverless car even safer since behaviour perfectly predictable driverlss car road whole suite additional communication utilised three currently rely determine driver intent
mean beautiful idea autonomous car would make traffic longer issue overall better modern world know else would eliminating suburb increasing public transport thats essentially would public transport extra step
mm fun would city self driving car evacuation dispatching car save everyone would obviously cause problem would take way long light need enough get everyone kindof defeat whole thing stopping car sitting nothing oh yeah need car mass evacuation used normal day hmm sound like someone lala land also thing called glitch malfunction error upkeep everything would expensive especially start breaking honestly spend taxithis thing year would financing new car take fing bus
think technology dumb idea billion car road manufacturer flag vehicle using app plane driving instrument decade used requirement getting license find weird fear mongering human ability perform task
issue technology dislike feel like company government find way use track people even already way im willing adopt way decentralize payment system tracking illegalized already much power gain data without approval refuse give
first saw derek show sb australia uranium loved came way included indigenous community feel mining land great channel keep good work found born know derek fellow aussie
autonomous car company write
thanks making video like really made feel better autonomous driving
ad disingenuous one watch video waymo trip vehicle sort operate fine everything textbook throw unexpected accident closed lane ect car doesnt know
great test car mumbai
veritasium video getting long winded much yadayada unnecessary information
selfdriving car send reflactions camera top wont know
began watching video opposed autonomous car didnt believe technology wasnt good enough thought order make autonomous car safer need change city making le friendly pedestrian ciclists kinda convinced human driver really good take dont wait five ten year safer city autonomous car technology better bring big highway go city center make lane narrower reduce speed limit promote public transportation make denser city pedestrian ciclists pass le accident le dumb human driving driving slowly space park housing school museum conclusion technology kinda cool already knowledge safer city always thanks watching thang video
firefly definitely resemble old fiat
talk support lady really dehumanizing assuming voice cant see face
derek made one small complaint drive inspired towards solution thanks sorry vague
much le level subaru warned rearend cloud condensing exhaust year get self driving wisconsin
problem isnt really autonomous car believe technology mile better safer human problem mixing human technology im afraid car wont able essentially predict driver driverless car yeah would amazing
waiting people terrible driver
yes yes yes transition time car autonomous enormous many people dont want car even would drive without accident dont think america country world appropiate law vehicle there next big problem would happen court car involved fatal accident fault car could thought stupid humn driving reckless human also main objective car independent way transportation want get destination without interact traffic use public transport last argument directed european people edit want say human race would develop adapt benefit technological development
wonder le privatelyowned car tell app schedule car come youll never search parking spot either
believe moral dilemma come autonomous vehicle question protecting data privacy passenger rather physical safety
one good solar flare boom gps right car front go know look like fun cant drive
thanks
enjoy stick shift jdms
thought would start tesla
yea thanks
know actually quite pro autonomous vehicle prior watching video flagrantly onesided presentation complete strawmanning argument driverless car mention idiotic assertion lidar mean cant crash thing supposed im opposed autonomous vehicle
im sure tesla homer brutal comment someone doesnt consider tesla homer still give u downgrade pumping lidar technology lead u fsd u dont tesla homer objectively admit lidar tech ultimately provide fsd wonder ru drinking waymo sponsorship coolade afraid criticize approach good video think u objective pump dump appropriate mean honestly u possibly video give honest critique waymo approach better worse tesla approach painfully obvious ur avoiding controversy serving vanilla sunshine rainbow tech type video uninteresting imo give ppl real deal assessment
car loud like really loud
begging pleading antonymous vehicle finally people dont care use cruise control turn signal predictable computer controlled machine finally way
friend kid driveway killed speeding year old residential street property ran speeding mercedes friend like changed ever car wouldnt ever happened come majority human suck believe well work healthcare field see doctor screwing time wish make autonomous diagnosis machinei havent seen good human accuracy
would like see vehicle drive india xdddddd
im tired waiting future people wont lift finger learn adapt literally retard progress hope conserving nothing broken slaughterhouse placeholder may never become functioning society push already stop letting inmate run asylum
yes although autonomous car proving safer hypothetical extreme case may indeed regulator still wouldnt give blanket approval allow autonomous car major public area liability problem event unlikely scenario occur would take responsibility company model didnt account scenario driver car provision inside manually take control car believe unless issue liability solved preferable regulator point view autonomous car road manual car get accident clear who blame driver pedestrian etc believe issue isnt simply one efficacy regulator look thing another lens scientistsengineers
taking shot wendover production
calling people stupid terrible great way reinforce people tendency wary
suck youre car enthusiast
safety v freedom choose freedom
soon much experience car try kidnap set hostage xd
need self driving car self made city walkable public transport wouldnt issue
everybody gangsta driver invisibility potion run
wait lidar work multiple vehicle using could one misread reflection another car
bet someone actually remote driving stop lying
tesla yet
honestly video isnt useful interesting one stating certain thing impossible never happen scientific reasonable say term mechanical system software best would extremely unlikely car safer one many factor determine whether vehicle useful could make special cocoon vehicle would prevent people dying due deceleration reduce death way would expensive impractical would interested seeing data autonomous car would work consumer model paying ride sharing service expensive service increase congestion would look like pay vehicle work individual dont support staff maintenance crew wouldnt want tesla situation require ton maintenance fixed one company update security issue inherent software going fault two autonomous vehicle crash want go drive meander around situation dont address drive see place looking
great video love enthusiasm transportation industry year feel like downplayed many significant difficulty however think eventually ironed whether take special road special maintenance schedule roadway whatever poll definitely got right year sound right
thing cope heavy rain stormy situation maybe lidar laser system blocked error failure system detection
mean car already anoutonums enough car id get bored death road
derek people distracted influenced etc etc driving also derek recording video u car front seat love derek
sponsored video fine min commercial waymo suck
biggest problem increased complexity automation world already growing wealth disparity terrifying point entire industry eliminated night
tech isnt yet really impressive ive yet see go snow slush debris yield ambulance etc casual driving needed convince
incident pedestrian car come sudden stop crosswalk speed bump speed bump would like know car made error human car reacting sudden appearance pedestrian proof computer aware environment human mistook speed bump crosswalk waymo might want look way differentiating width crosswalk usually wider speed bump would suggest color unfortunately thing uniformity crosswalk white yellow brick pattern even rainbow
wasnt scary ride driver le car
seems near future autonomous car bus taxi quickly private vehicle brand new car good road good weather im sure work great dont think gon na easy hundred thousand mile shitty condition misuse owner clock dont think fancy laser radar sensor eleventy nine camera last long say dusty condition parked sea think least going require frequent costly maintenance worst thing suddenly fail wrong time imagine year future million car road year old badly maintained fixed owner full rust corrosion owner used trusting car theyre even looking goingthere accident think big problem
impossible crash make error
driverless vehicle become common beginning end allowed manually drive conspiracy maybe probable definitely
thing trust drive car le computer human
sound like train dog cat drive u
waymo geofenced need detail high re mapping anywhere going go limited kind dead end available phoenix san francisco maybe couple place tesla huge lead waymo others tesla currently billion mile driven autopilot
case pilot crashed plane practice seems someone something else take beyond certain amount cause usual driver practice used take control dangerous point vehicle need ready take control time
one way government could control
miss international travel restricted pilot project singapore ive seen car around business park seeing waymo van road palo alto much impactful
always see example video bright sunny day really bad rain midwest blizzard criminal figure need jump front car stop another smash grab lady purse human experience know turn wheel punch gas get safety builtin like protect occupant one big city pothole thanks interestingeven question hope see technology advance start lawnmower lawn ownnow would take skill maybe trust car sooner roombalike mower
day subscribe service get autonomous car door time want go anywhere price paying car im switching without hesitation montreal area would mean searching parking spot need clean snow car morning need deal maintenance able door door commute something constructive car benefit owning car benefit public transit none downside
id like know respond catastrophic mechanical failure tire blowout hydroplaning black ice patch
think another issue reason seems like see car action law admittedly havent really looked could wrong imagine probably many law regulation around operation driverless car think law get point make total sense though id probably still want ability take drive manual need similar reason pilot important
motorcycle helmet thing really wack dude
waymo hurry move australia ill run
unsubbed hope im one
lmao
waymo need abide law set forth towards emergency vehicle someone walking play siren noise youtube waymo oh snap coming sound sound close pull oh warning meltdown imminent evacuate evacuate
empty car driving around spewing carbon atmospheregreat
im driverless long would take make work winter snowice
damn want invest company lol
come european perspective say still car still dangerous give public transport anyday dont get wrong great company managed much service far solution traffic solution moving people place place efficiently certainly theyve managed accumalate data thought would doubt itll grow exponentially add car fleet therefore system become better big problem see tech seems proprietry least ive heard open source version full self driving tesla develop version unlike waymos actually seriously hurt people database need open source allow selfdriving car company level safety waymo return contribute database making even larger therefore even better safer waymo achieve still though prefer automated metro system faster safer one hell lot better people overall remember build around people car
id sooner trust driverless car human maniac road around
cant wait
india indian era dont believe automated elevator well get well think automated vehicle trial
let ask need large scale
saw parking lot first couple second said thats arizona saw waymo knew right wild
pretty hard braking car going super slow thats bug report
submit feedback
least stopped
idea often
hell auto braking feature much nonautonomous audi q stop abruptly think im backing garage fast
rosewraith u ride autonomous car often
nasty pray whoever mess
weird kinda dont want get car person
million mile year human driving experience argument doesnt work human learn many many time faster experience computer show child cat itll able recognize cat reliably ml ai need thousand example still think driverless car better human driver particular argument good
feel surreal privileged car used well maintained road currently basically yet another gadget rich city folk doesnt address many issue come driving city especially come environment wont autonomous vehicle increase amount car road camera technology increased drain limited resource would prefer see city stop focusing car road much put much time effort infrastructure creating better public transport footpath cycling path better environment better health benefit poorer middle class citizen richest rich
people also would stop buying boring as car maybe theyd enjoy driving bit totally cant wait replace corollaprius
importantly fedex adopt technology dont work anymore
work
fedex apply technology hundred thousand people would job
get another job right
already way partnered nuro p
lofu fulfilling job sitting cab truck day bored mind
take thing downtown chicago willing bet anything total fail also would love see thing operate heavy rain snow storm laser sensor get jacked
think silly remove silly ethical question driverless car hit programmercompany get sued nonsense programmed hit motorcyclist helmet situation ethical dilemma best way either tesla beta claim liability throw machine learning something cant blame anybody
object visible lidar inner circle something curb could mistaken lidar solid object garbage bin keep driving past kid get run across something huge blind spot unintelligent software make lidar limited visual recognition best suited detects kid even lying ground human potentially slow etc lidar youre dot whereas camera youre known object type
elevator lift operator job title lever control motion manual door open descriptive floor announcement stock trade still around early along pneumatic tube carrying money receipt capsule sale clerk central cashier office
dont problem autonomous vehicle would probably feel fine using minute dont like financial motivation company developing autonomous car large part data collection passenger
okay kinda understand cyclist skater hitting still car maybe lost balance whatever kind buffoon walk stationary car
buffloons glued cell phone
whatever circumstance gon na difficult defend youve collided stationary obstacle
car tendency stop really sharply human get close say pulling crosswalk pedestrian went jaywalk behind anticipating car stopping crosswalk would stop short hence someone walking back end least two coworkers get hit cyclist way
need im disabled able drive detracting life many serious way need want road safer trust human driver absolutely mind
pronoun going use aidriven car gender race buyer choice forced based bitcoins nonfungable transfer opportunity
guy backing ignoring reverse camera clearly dash fill full rage stupidity humanity
downtempo music
know hey lety
fully autonomous vehicle definitely future however think right lack somewhat one crucial area cybersecurity need secure modern airplane anything like
self driving car exists taxi freight busand et cetera driver sweat nervously seriously though ethical concern debate automate driver profession might come next
thing elevated driver find new job ideally society make sure safety net people lose job government probably wont vote people protect people fight worker right
lol se driver using mobile phone happens yet could possible dark car fault wife uturn another car meter away couldnt first go thought could driver likely phone crashed end result wife fault even though person could easily slowed stopped allowing wife complete point turn without video evidence pay autonomous vehicle would avoid put insurance company business
one biggest hurdle convincing people give dumb car especially youre one people think theyre average likely imagine data aside anecdotal group people refuse consider electric vehicle im excited technology make road safer people car motorcyclist well
excited see future hold one thought im construction worker carry pound tool work everyday live los angeles would love le traffic le risk le stress impractical also im curious know fee would month insurancegas would able afford anyone insight would love learn
think likely insurance company drive change fastest see financial incentive people forced pay car insurance car quite literally never crash jump board eventually likely illegal control vehicle anything emergency situation really hope doesnt try push wont anything happy crap though see coming
judy yo check vid wasnt speaking tech speaking people perception tech even technology good enough people still wont trust insurance company first board point im making car currently ready closer seem think though selfdriving car driven rough condition done fine sens car far superior sens human car see blizzard human thing holding back driving skill computer though coming along quickly even learns rate child would expect five year le selfdriving car drive condition car already driving snowstorm example seem think selfdriving car would worse human already job traction control like keeping spinning black ice perception doesnt match reality wont match reality future people dont understand technology underestimate
elizab realize technology unrelated either way like use
car fine passenger died heart attack
imagine first itll limited low speed like mph even thats much faster signal light
susceptible system sort security breach like idea would hate see something like get hacked turned chaos
one thing remember human stupidity road huge traffic seems like big accident way road traffic cause people slow look accident time looking front likely cause another crash
miss time ricer vtec speeding
human error main cause program software control hardware autonomous vehicle weve never exploitation software yea
nope software always reliable never problem
still take stair elevator fart trap mean death trap
imagine lifetime auto accident death rate go million year imagine lifetime kid ride school even safer imagine day percent nation automated really isnt thing driver license test
commenting make algorithm like video want autonomous car bad
cool cant wait future sit driverless car take u intelligent home aidriven fridge stove prepared meal thinking car ai robot served aidriven writing app written blog post day support world day calendar theme published new book amazon ai art assistant painted painting hung ai house exhausted human sit front aidriven algorithm serf blog content created aidriven assistant relax human sofiahub product latest merger pornhub sofia robot manufacturer suck dick contemplate
think true global rollout little year away due number edge case would need considered car state alone australia would left side driving need fully implemented scratch incredibly fringe hook turn would need implemented well getting real world data hook turn would take considering appear handful intersection
think bad road difficult condition real problem
question driving data connected internet subject hacker haking car taking controle completly indepentint car subject unforseen exploitation people happens car run gas electricity happens camera malfunction break experinces car related problem like engine light turning tire pressure light turning would road get suddenly blocked something like falling tree branch thing flying back someone el car
little disappointed sound like really well produced commercial waymo real challenge launching driverless car real world challenge difficult solve company said driverless car year away suddenly updated estimate question isnt car better pesky human thats easy building system design need close perfect kill people negligence
put dollar lety brazilian know accent mile away
build train nerd
blew mind
lovely isnt many nuisance would vanish youve eliminated slack extra space time human use isnt necessary one car faulty connection accelerates incorrect speed happens next elegant dance coordination turned high speed pileup human intuitively pad expectation margin safety keep u alive world nothing ever work perfectly last time saw something always work perfectly blew mind ever needed reason never get car driven computer sequence right system trying achieve result trusted human life
ryvaken ok buddy overthinking thats ideal model fully autonomous traffic simulation course thats nowhere near expectation get road even ideal traffic flow say would increase efficiency factor
ive fan chanel year thought intellectual phenomenon video quickly changed mind imagine day cant buy car anymore since government subsidizes car corporation offer ride people youre limited choice go guarantee future would happen asking logical philosophical question essential whether
car look stupid thats sure
going interesting see aftermath technology regard employment transportation industry
btw also think bit weird talk fully autonomous car completely ignoring potential interaction car car selfdriving certain region designated selfdriving car highway dont really need read traffic sign read traffic light listen siren recognize car visually thing supplied data dont want look traffic individual car collaborative endeavor
respond school bus stopping stop sign
much better tesla garbage
hahahahahaha
guy john cena duplicated driving
use train
cheaper call one within minute best human contact
police would become irrelevant road bc every car would safe car insurance would become obsolete every car would safe wow yes future lobbyist congress make sure never happens
bro risking sk
steering wheel
think exciting looking vantage point old hometown north border seeing u population reacting science based solution problem time pretty sure u first country fully adopt
saved life significantly reduced traffic need parking street european city free car check street one day cleaned car moved street huge many car reduce space
considering smart decided sit back one already would sit driver seat monitor automated driver way pilot analogy plain wrong two pilot required control cruise flight hate autolands low visibility need make sure airplane stay course also need make sure autopilot fly aircraft correctly many autopilot failure relatively simple environment except going around thunderstorm get complicated driving extremely complicated environment autopilot fail
autopilot airplane around probably since
german launching pilotless aircraft london got plane still pilot though
video bit boring least compared video clear lack fun information throughout first half video couldnt bothered watch second half
proliferation driverless car would make driving safer exist livable city one built solely purpose traveling car adam something made video criticizing cgp grey video cited mention scene quoted pedestrian nightmare although may technically safer necessitates pedestrian live subordinate car last however many year city profoundly changed car infrastructure often taking away liberty pedestrian cyclist city fit start spending resource reducing car dependence creating robust urban environment transit mix give freedom power back vulnerable road user dont know driverless car affect city one lane freeway shown solution traffic car road way efficiency automated private car likely show seems likely best way reduce traffic death emission etc simply fewer car
bro need tesla little puppy today training wheel
tesla near safe
car drive virtual track car drive tesla solving computer vision truly autonomous anywhere world road weymo cool year behind come global release viability
thatguywecalldana us laser spinning extremely fast measure time take light bounce back proceeds make model generation thousand different scenario carperson might meanwhile showing car see panel front proving track see everything tesla us camera near reliable mean shame tesla family owns tesla love feel perfect get better equipment scan releasing public dad work waymo car reliability rode one couple time always incredibly smooth comforting screen showing car see forget also explained video damn long message please research making claim like
davetheduck yea okay data thats uploaded car pre plotted take take weymo designated track zone ie downtown wont know programmed loop city sure see object function outside boundary fact need many sensor camera function disadvantage tesla youve said need visual camera completely function autonomously anywhere world unless work weymo know complete science behind would highly encourage research exactly work
thatguywecalldana watch video still laser time track know dad head reliability dude set track need know car please research making assumption please please please
great video many question always obey speed limit get flow traffic thats applicable incident driver tried road rage waymo car respond case car stop sign heavy traffic trouble entering crossing intersection way take greater risk making entry otherwise would handle rare circumstance like orphan nun hoping driverless car soon
follows speed limit actually usually go slower speed limit accelerated slowly waymo generally frustrates human driver drive like old woman idea car shuts doesnt know often nope wait wait wait traffic build behind best stop completely wait human driver worst something dangerous look waymo video arent ad thing dangerous prototype need human driver follow
science communicator would getting close useless scale sponsored waymo say bringing critical eye topic yes going vast improvement selfdriving car close hey really interview intelligent skeptic covering issue like lidar fail sensor fail ability handle different weather traffic condition finally understanding probability weak
train first came service people afraid would happen moved speed whatever speed train
flying car also self driving car
shoulda got delamain excelsior service
think biggest question security driverless car computer know terrible security currently even big multimillion company get hacked hole security might get one driving car always worrying cybersecurity vehicle
ill concede tech think last least year away deal driving canada snow slush rural area need general ai think point im sure driving concern
one limitation point money
dont think pretty basic thing learn see black ice dont drive dont turn hydroplaning thing human generally arent capable seeing camera lidar plain dont react well also basic drive carefully visibility low type stuff work keep mind lidar see fine situation quite literally zero way human dont think zero problem think rare extreme situation favor machine way doesnt human car sense loss traction hundred thousand time quickly human trust already thing like traction control stuff ai direct control way human couldnt dream like saying dog could never keep human thing dog huge advantage cant think way advantage would even outweigh human even safer driver arent usually
exactly thought know drive black ice road well lidar work fog heavy snow unplowed road covered packed snow deep rut unpaved gravel road washboard large pot hole section deep mud believe driverles car way better youre testing arizona winnipeg february logging road spring british columbia really go show much trust technology people still need drive place look like tech might stuck city place weather doesnt look like canada
trust distracted novice intoxicated reckless driver computer driver
gswitz watch video self driving car far better sensor human eyesight itll fine heavy snow
thanks hardly safety continue make life reliant service car rate rent dont worry wont need wait repo man disable wherever company already monthly fee feature built car fun future eh
mention youre found guilty wrongthink service get completely cancelled
id like see le car centric infrastructure u mass transit development bike friendly development would serve lot country populated area ebikes personal electric mobility device way efficient trip car like great av safer human driver could save many life day day level dont know much utility autonomous vehicle request service could give requesting manned lyfttaxi much cheaper really would operator many saving actually pas consumer av cool fascinating im skeptical theyll solve car problem
driverless car make sense u road driving boring hope dont get uk enjoy driving would always choose driver passenger would want hand key computer might well get rid car well work shopping socialising etc internet lockdownstyle
compare driving u driving autobahn
yes driverless car dont make mistake human real question potential mistake car human normally wont make
nope potential mistake dont matter already far away better human eventually mistake people die yes people literally dieing real question human going go ego trip purpousfully rage autobots typical american git muh gun fashion crashing etc
viardent driverless car street starting see mistake human driver wont make risk car run program program fails responding issue car problem sure probably make le mistake overall risk taken seriously rather making political shaming people criticism
hmohsenhd starting see mistake except arent even still wouldnt matter rationally argue flat earthers assume arent one antivaxers christian cant rationally discussion one side bad faith argueing problem self driving car software isnt open source therefore auditing performance based company access gps camera microphone etc data car inside trust arent giving government worse advertiser issue absolutely dwarf car get accident tiny compared human actually driving car human bad earth fly around sun thats
honda sk love car
autonomous vehicle campus take u class shes correct eventually get used start become second nature
one stop pouring sugar gas tank
convinced
like see autonomous car handle narrow lane hilly street city eyeballing opposing driver environmental context often determines give way
hmmmm smart crazy person thinking wonder hack control everything lock door wont let drive crowd people send bridge done multiple vehicle time terrorist wet dream fear vehicle everything hackable thats net
automated shoe please
imagine took money spent ev self driving car used build public transportation infrastructure instead
imagine would even better apply selfdriving system public bus would always driving route learn different unique aspect route
towards trusting car programming rather car
absolutely excited driverless car one increase speed limit get destination ballet driverless car two get rid car insurance
people would still car insurance car car need repair bad weather damage
nate car need repair think stupid reason insurance proliferates propaganda insurance company bad weather sure either way reason still illegal drive without car insurance clear legality problem illegal drive car insurance want pay car insurance go saying never exist people always happy take money
addition car also maintained better nobody decide check engine light doesnt need fixed say grinding noise isnt big deal mechanic something show there issue instead waiting month make job easier road safer
part want selfdriving carsbut part afraid wont able drive future like driving fun still remember feeling first got licence gon na sad future generation never experience
totally trust driverless car whats ive read totally trust someone sponsored telling fine dont tell want want drive
remember purveyor selfdriving car said theyd wide circulation year ago still think
go transportation job next half century wonder society overcome problem
like electric car car also facility needed arround
derek weird trusting driverless car also derek hop makeshift cart giant windmill
passenger could please drive fast im little late car please fasten seatbelt passenger car fast furious mode
know ending stated car parked boon would like personal fully autonomous vehicle personally waste space long way hail one ease fairly quick see large benefit one major concern taxi service cleanliness drive car personal germ since always drive alone
hope got electric scooter going everywhere abandon wrong side road pedestrian phone etc green make twat regressive health safety
stoked love technology
dude seriously put koolaid like arguing paper new revolution boating technology
mean yeah sure cool working let one camera lidar get calibration ping wrong reading youre hitting barricade mph primary concern would often need software checked hardware calibrated updated even feasible opposed normal vehicle
im mostly autonomous car wish could publicly owned instead owned capitalist enterprise
never trust auto drive car ive seen irobot
personally cant wait autonomous transport like limo every day time get nap text watch vids whatever road instead getting road rage whats like maybe loss human job automation downside see
imagine population people completely suck driving driving score another people awesome driver score average score population fact better average driving point statistic hard think know statistic probably dont know statistic statistically
people always think moral person people think outside box using similar scenario trolley experiment contribute one doubt technological advancement tested experiment ill think third fourth option
big fattie ad
car waymoo
happens say lidar vehicle near like lane conflict system due laser affecting lidar
cool thanks
future car become fully autonomous reason well still need use driver licence identification purpose xd
could make video puting tax work installing intelligent traffic light throughout great nation since obviously evident technology around imagine usausausa
dont want driverless car there rush
gon na need totally separate infrastructure pevs driver like onewheel greatest invention time
oil change required dashboard company dedicated car autonomy also cant stay top car maintenance
derek everyone autonomous vehicle happens people want weaponize engine exhaust noise driving loudly aggressively possible freedom derek
dude last two video rough
wonder autonomous two wheeler would easier complex make car
people really invested putting electric autonomous bandaids car claim theyre green safe fundamental design car still always anti social space hogging resource inefficient
imagine taking offroad campsite northwest loaded full camping gear
going say great like oh need go like taxi like going tow boat north cabin launch boat move furniture etc people comment like mass transit ride share like thats fine visiting city however want car freedom
barronohbeefdipp unfortunately believe eventually privilege available certain class reduce resource impact environment
tea come take car like boom boom stick
wow seriously idea technology far along seems according video mr veritasium felt comfortable enough didnt even want get vehicle wow want technology blossom hasnt yet coming im id like see tech blossoming well know id love see major city like los angeles new york chicago dallas place around globe traffic suck thank much making video semperfi carryon
use asiana flight sfo flawed read ntsb report around accident due lack training asian carrier known using inexperienced pilot sited ntsb major contributing factor pilot heavy reliance automation actually thought auto throttle engaged thats forgot system used instrument approach day put position visual approach proficient automation nice item task loaded situation allows load easier task pilot flying focus task may require thought said also tends mess alot take intervention order perform flight safely
would interested autonomous car deal almost driving far self driving car surrounded human operated would fleet swarm operate much testing done condition another concern societal one job loss transport industry employ many people final concern one security laptop hacked may loose data car fleet car hacked self driving car become part life question answer problem solve technology related
autonomous car solve car wreck autonomous train solve traffic
thank im one drive fool dont promote
would solve lot slow traffic issue need communicate maneuver going perform every vehicle around react appropriately mean there rubberbanding stop go movement car car wait green light start accelerating time rate
biggest problem driverless car drive onto road like india
still think technology year away yes driverless car probably better driving highway better avoiding accident general situation road would require almost fully general ai simple example obstacle possibility either cross double yellow line safe turn around way also violates rule road self driving car would probably stop proceed fact safe way forward another example single track two way road wide enough one car yes road stupid exist two human driver encounter one give either pull aside one pass maybe even back two self driving car decide give running different software different protocol perhaps could even solve two car impasse problem hard coded solution okay situation four car two track road two pull aside human solve problem communicating dont see way self driving car short also learning language becoming general ai
good luck snowy new york road
question lidarradar system work ten hundred vehicle sending signal road know similar problem solved navy plane problem autonomous vehicle
feel like video shilling google oh right sponsored google expect better veritasium
cant wait widespread man driving really one anxiety inducing action daily life least would willing pay much security daily basis
progress
driving snow feel like need data like far though
waymo currently struggle small section phoenix city designed around big clearly marked street look video arent ad car struggle situation isnt textbook
bay area native im surprised know nothing guess wasnt area time lot going still wow
waymo nee google headquartered mountain view ca much testing done immediate surrounding neighborhood decided go live actual empty driver seat chose phoenix az probably ca wouldnt let az would
digitaldan part knew comment plain crash sfo
rose want
definitely place dont expect replace family car right sensor pack cost top price car robotics necessary may come point elite try outlaw private ownership nonselfdriving vehicle course collector exempt mass would pawn elite like want
future driving drastically reduce amount car infrastructure world create pedestrianfriendly city although exponentially complicated costly much greater impact environment human safetyhealth adding autonomous vehicle road
maybe good city use doesnt work well everyone else location
make life reliant service car rate rent dont worry wont need wait repo man disable wherever fun future eh
tea even part city access different opportunity think op suggestin totalitarian control equal commodity exist everywhere move house state employ homogenisation segregation class cant educate needed university elsewhere job another product amazon deliver instead cultural ace culture nature

plastic bag get trapped roof lidar
car behave better map memory sensor combination two
big thing understand tech doesnt need flawless need safer average driver isnt particularly high bar
untill start killing people whole safer argument fall apart mom cry tesla cant shrug say sorry son died fire software made mistake dont worry statically safer human driver human arent computer
theowenmajor yea human suck lot computer task better average driver looking million le death injury recorded injury people hitting way around
gaberielpendragon didnt comprehend point making statistical argument doesnt work real world criminal liability doesnt care statistic self driving car start killing people liable parent start demanding car banned counter argument waymo going cite statistic grieving family
theowenmajor word looking stats showing u criminal liability going almost exclusively human negligence caused accident case accident waymo liable resolved every accident insurance pay life go stats also showing vehicle liable vehicle done everything possible mitigate damage unlike human driver waymos also cant drive drunk yet even million accident taken road lawyer insurance company already dont handle accident margin care bereaved sure would think would change entire point nonpoint
gaberielpendragon viewpoint tech bro delusion im talking insurance claim im talking weeping mother standing next politician demanding regulation put place protect street happens going able win breaking spreadsheet waymo kill someone wont able cite statistic defense public doesnt care tech bros think everything explained spreadsheet break enough graph problem go away simplified nonsense waymo currently stuck waymo spent year trying improve system success waymo realizing system cant deal real world amount ai training give computer ability make human decision watch video waymos trip drive like grandma shuts whenever something different happens real world computer lab reducible basic input rule deal
thing driverless car need handle unusual construction reroutes especially one highway sometimes combine highway lane merging together sometimes lane narrow usual bridge construction worker walking close cement road block
im really looking forward dont see new zealand really much next year
malcolm gladwell wa saying something effect car road safe couldnt work people would come know could walk right front fear hit would thered complete gridlock work effectively would take occasional jaywalker keep everyone else honest personally like idea
taxi pretty awesome car ehh kinda enjoy driving driverless car wont try rape ala people think happens ubers
car drive invented age agothey called taxi james may
think tesla would make reality soon
interesting
real trust issue tesla crash showed human accelerating car slammed brake
dont see year take longer make infrastructure car drive mention everyone trading car buying fully autonomous car agree year least minimum year may tech ability put everywhere
imagine far along theyd toyata would free right gps tech car could thatd maximize flow traffic avoid accident car could talk locate car nearby geo location sensor toyota want u keep insurance company around something maybe sell car tough replace car thats getting wreck maximizedmeaning le wear tear
work

cool tech would still like instant controle need idea tech amazing fear controle say fear flying driving tho k death u alone there maybe plane disaster year bad year edit every car auto would le fear could make map whole city auto car would efficent due never stop sendrecive info
would opinion wasnt sponsored waymo lending hard credibility minute commercial includes lot could be ifs fed independent analysis shilling large corporate sponsor like waymo bountybtw make want drop list dependable channel
edit hears talk unlikely scenario yet hackings happen every single day hacking driverless vehicle far unrealistic possibility even sony microsoft could hacked there absolutely possibility driverless car hacked true zero possibility hacking happening comfortable driverless car let hope hacker dont figure hack computer thing
thats cool rich guy stuff built low wage country really pay anybody anything skim thats cool
also autonomous car car road accident reduced way accident happen system get attacked
sure reduced traffic people get vehicle drive home come pick dont need walk extra potentially doubling traffic
lidar basically bat mobil dont problem driverless car long theyre among driverless car im scared many unpredictable people still driving around

get never getting around least developing something used really important software job life risk theyve talking communication acm well decade company dont want make engineer expensive engineer dont want know practice mandated outdated torturous corrupt money machine training company testing company etc nothing get done predict selfdriving car legal landscape force government hand yeah overall machine better predictable human shouldnt terribly surprising note case airplane many people terrified flying reason fairly straightforward feel control able control would able deceive believing something bad happened could save option even provided mountain evidence profoundly safer specifically control people become tremendously uncomfortable petrified fear extra stuff mention near end there even reason child wouldnt able hail selfdriving car head friend house teen already large part getting driver license theyve broken psychologically independence able use travel safely parent monitor every single movement car phone likely watch video feed inside car eavesdrop every word speak breath take like home school life theyll comfortable never given burden freedom make even smallest decision conduct without reviewed profiled potential risk factor punished rewarded etc people ride cargo selfdriving vehicle could used send item across town pretty easily id expect integration thing like doordash lot possibility think theyll banned first one make public spectacle described
great video please get gimbal stabilize video somehow please
defently year future third world xd put going stolen detroyed
victim car crash including one driver blew thru stop sign sending txt msg girlfriend car tboned mine live chronic pain autonomous car dont need perfect need better u seriously people awful million injury per year u ten thousand dead honest im terrified getting automated car know safer human road look forward
could prioritize walkability public transit road commuter traffic result series policy choice overengineered expensive solution dont confront take granted political solution impossible undesirable fix everything technology need selfdriving car solve problem weve forced
good im autonomy let autonomize medical industry let autonomize legal system letscnot start low wage working job let go big money grabbing job
havent watched video yet im good
forgot one major fact teenager use baseball bat fun car without passenger even passenger dont care cause car reason one today care owner sitting car happen rental escooters big city car hope start big city next year cant wait see beat car picking
ready driverless car happen many people treat car like theyre driven someone else sitting pilot seat ton missile shaving reading talking phone arguing texting makeup paying attention food sleeping etc etc etc everything actually piloting highspeed missile though feel happen wont happen fear people stupid effectively unconscious around people even around driverless car ensure accident continue happenuntil full automation complete mandated mean time remember get behind wheel manualdrive vehicle road nothing else important driving vehicle destination coming safe stop nothing public service announcement p
work company sf competition waymo drive hour day way ready cool sure buuuuuuuut enough close call didnt engage manual drive someone could killed seriously hurt also waymo get jaguar sf lucky lol edit ive even accident come merging stop sign seeing pedestrian car lacking best
think one biggest challenge going software security thing along purposeful sensor trickery people bad faith breach could lead hacker purposefully crashing car either singular bulk along abduction potential symbolic trickery sensor code physical trick sensor knowledge many sensor usually used machine vision issue mirror could lead troll malcontent placing object graffiti cause passing car react crash divert course specific spot imagine example starting circumstance ww specific turn involved lead assassination could accomplished purpose learning road politician target go placing software triggering object approach turn side road
cant drive car least tell burn
look people stuff normally driving driverless car
predicted range higher far predicted area
yeah waimos never fully autonomous even year kinda funny tesla much ahead everyone
parome lidar trap come self driving depending radar technology never work
parome expensive form mass production actually feed bad data ai due low resolution example bridge tunnel fog lidar frequency light feed bad data algorithm making car go crazy simply stop without anything
spent gdp getting moon baffle spent little
end time vouch driverless car need road yesterday
poll shouldve fourth option regulation law infrastructure ready real issue selfdriving car constant reinforcement terrible driver became much video focus yes awful driver yes make mistake need regulation allows technology implemented comparing driverless automated vehicle elevator bad comparison automatic elevator dont make complex decision avoid drunk operator pedestrian even inattentiveness problem autopilot plane pointed pilot even plane autopilot doesnt factor hundred operator theyre minute interval air traffic heavily regulated heavily observed especially close airport air traffic control still operation place fix issue pilot automatic manual video show selfdriving car happen awesome didnt explain true challenge surrounding implemented yet
real answer human crash poor road design government care make road safer problem mentioned video exist due poorly designed city car centric design horrible way count hand government dont care safety human life environment self driving car solving problem purposely created human people government dont like money cant find enough way waste
sure driverless car cool people like love drive result people want continue drive dont trust technology enjoy
wat witness youtuber talking autonomous driving without mentioning tesla car
demonstrate many car
canyonerowhiplash
anyone reading comment future autonomous car everywhere
thing people think itll take year mean worldwide usa might frequent within year parr world itll take much longer
unmanned car around think year mainstream place
arent around waymo kind work small section single city designed simple car navigation constantly minuetly scanned watch nonsponsored video see waymo struggling slightly complicated scenario
road still ready wont least another year
maybe aeroplane bad example trust driverless car dont particularly want car programmed people boeing paid hr write software max
well city people car accident
information video game changer
must nice trying phoenix would love see test drive middle new england winter road caked black ice want see reaction adverse weather radar may always accuracy pick
self driving tech reliant lidar radar scalable almost case system need path preprogrammed system like train track telsas approach ai eye camera scalable tought car see react respond remember drive drop tesla brand new city self drive physically reading sign direction drop waymo city itll sit awaiting direction
engineer someone like tech forgetting quite large number population country taxibustruck driver make living driving there absolutely question tech long time coming definitely future somebody answer moral question society cant take advantage future tech
public transportation infrastructure please
insanely scary think aviation industry going autonomous next year mostly im college become pilot year college extreme cost computer take job crazy
year ago met couple engineer working autonomous car back thinking smart car smart highway working system included senderreceiver system vehicle highway come long way senior citizen realize driving ability may diminish year would nice maintain way get around im ready looking forward
dirt get sensor though
refueling vergil work would center car go fueled machine would create job people fuel car
somehow think going become left v right thing
love driving also cant wait car autonomous u terrible distracted
yeah rest ride slow autonomous vehicle im flying past regular car free bird
blastme suddenly tesla roadster cpu becomes jealous start racing
blastme people like would cause autonomous car go slow well capped kmh guy ford truck refuse get automated ford human equation well ratchet bad boy kmh highway
thought thing commute minute every day time im spending driving could better spent thing like sleeping dicking around facebook also wonder itd go wildlife live rural australia wonder car would go kangaroo jump behind tree last time happened month ago handful millisecond react swerving managed take side mirror avoid totalling car
would simply prefer public transit
still feel push back great since people reluctant even adopt car run electricity gasoline needle say car without steering wheel
lety amazing woman
someone initially opposed technology convinced
ad money well spent waymo
shouldnt want car road except blackbird
beginning
fully autonomous vehicle boring corolla oh yeah im havin fun
final nail coffin regular car self driving car communicate system wide level every car around car front say going stopping there crash ahead everything fine traffic congestion car crash thing past
sorry ready
min promotion im anti self driving car cant tell one problem point time
damn gon na flying autopiloted car
going flying car widespread basis autopiloted
actually believe happen earlier fully autonomous road car
uselesszero probably since plane already land
one thing think true test special perticular situation one think never happen sometimes
warrant lock door drive nearest police station
even matter
lol itd better cause youd never get pulled since youd never driving erratically
thought bit cute thought would replace parking lot green space building generate tax revenuesome kind personal profit honestly tech cool glad progressing well
cgp grey need see
main problem ownership transportation independence travel want beholden corporation get around
machine dont make kind mistake tell people killed tesla driving thing uber killed someone conditioned science fiction make u believe computer infallible make mistake better human every task real world self driving technology shown u isnt true selfdriving car far behind human driver may never good without breakthrough artificial intelligence included waymo many year still working self driving car outside area light traffic perfect road minimal pedestrian rain
machine dont make kind mistake exactly sentiment ruined many life british post office horizon scandal maybe derek gave example precisely refers said kind mistake id believe definitely come across trying mislead audience hugely overselling reliable safe machine
another benefit autonomous vehicle travel closelyspaced convoy longer higherspeed stretch road drafting drastically improves fuel efficiency internal combustion electric car alike unsafe due primarily human reaction time autonomous car could travel nearly bumper bumper highway speed conserving lot energy rds energy highway speed used pushing air could coordinate enmasse redistribute traffic congested area reducing overall average travel time energy use could know traffic light timing coast slow ahead time reduce energy wasted braking lot potential efficiency gain
excited driverless car
terrifying fully autonomous vehicle per se theyre manifestation real world humanreplacing machine accrue human lifetime experience handful year unless human develop mean directly sharing knowledge experience comparable rate specie become obsolete within lifetime alive today
im excited self driving vehicle also dont want give driving experience yes safer itll great traffic there something connection human machine dont want completely give
unfortunately people whore smart enough want driverless car arent one shouldnt driving garbage driver one wholl refuse stop driving
objectively robot better almost everything compared human almost everything
hearing phoenix az made leap joy definitely trying hope expands detest driving
selfdriving car sound great id love one think theyll absolutely ludicrously expensive far longer take accepted like electric
plot twist weve actually discovered secret invisibility person front invisible
standy looking couple kissing
would never want driverless car unless amazing guarantee would remain option pilot oneself otherwise giving yet another sovereign aspect existence yet way many sheep willing give wheel individual responsibilityautonomy others covid told lot fearful sacrifice others right hate fearful people
love work entire video ad sound like even wrote whole script
go rest follow
autonomous bus
least good condition technology currently functional well yeah good predictable condition tough part lane marking worn there duplicate marking due construction crossover oncoming lane construction zone heavy rain snow unpredictable semipredictably lawbreaking human driver also malicious external manipulation doubt tech get want see offense nonsponsored thirdparty video vehicle abnormal unpredictable situation hacking think biggest longterm worry enough time im sure thing like unideal road condition unpredictable driver handled always active everevolving threat form people trying manipulate break thing
hacking definitely legitimate concern personally also worry machine ethic fully autonomous car get situation injury unavoidable prioritize prioritize older pedestrian younger one system determining least amount damage possible hit someone who responsible company non driver weigh legality driving versus safety would drive illegally prevent injury like going double yellow line likewise react accident get rearended going keep going selfdiagnostic engine trouble inevitably happens continue going exacerbating damage see accident side road keep going react wildlife like deer edit also morality thing addressed doesnt actually answer question
another thing addressed video handle bad weather lidar affected rain rain drown sound siren enough cant hear wind snow know hydroplaning
autoclickers remember original title
driver assistance feature car worse become driving
toyota dynamic cruise control lane keeping spend time monitoring whats going around maybe long road trip wouldnt sure
anyone else getting malcolm gladwell vibe script incredibly similar revisionist history podcast subject
id feel safe road full self driving car passenger self driving car road
let see year couple month also nice wendover
nice technology trust thing hear talk think nd time totally safe ignoring human error around
kit knight rider thats robot uber hell yeah
tesla actually much advanced one point look driving work tesla camera film road car calculates model live ai used navigate model waymo first googleearth like capture vehicle drive around town creates detailed model using camera lidar downloaded cascual waymo car us ai navigate think waymo ai better tesla ai way tesla creates model surounding way better
car think like biker understands level attention paying also yes driver getting much worse many
waymo joke perfect weather hd mapped perfect road onlytesla future autonomous driving almost autonomous driving dangerous average distracted texting human driving
self driving car futur reduce greenhouse gas emission eliminate traffic jam reduces stress commuting cant wait
trusted automated car ready capable problem isnt technology ready problem dont trust people car arent automated people problem car
asiania flight wasnt manual landing nice day automatic landing system broken reason crash happened pilot become dependent auto land system well trained manual landing cultural issue also played part crash show one big unspoken pitfall automation computer longer know throw control back human human might ill equipped handle situation account dependent computer want auto drive next car something think
never prefer sitting behind wheel driving fun
cant wait autonomous car hacked either die get rickrolled
sad job lost automation
im excited two master degree one biggest barrier better employment license im moving within next five year biggest factor already considering arizona anyway wish could support technology
future human might job leasing renting brain
cant wait city person know people suck driving
especially confronted bicyclist recent commercial
never seen electronic device doesnt bug randomly require restart get around problem assume would issue restarting nowhere
heavy rain snow dont think
cant silence inner snowden saying car big privacy issue
thats google investing billion car company collecting data everyone controlling behavior people
movement tracked face id mean already phone new vehicle remotely shutdown
tru already carry around gps microphone
exploitation gon na insane
youre right concerned another addition internet thing
cost one biggest problem year away becomes standard feature one two decade away standard feature new car becomes standard car road existing car least year life
much enjoy driving especially twisty rural road look forward fully autonomous driving especially major road eliminate people driving way speed limit allowing merge something else described stupid ask place drive corvette fully manual mode c enjoy experience
let waymo people know key improvement could make car case sudden stop pointed would car say something like sorry sudden stop looked like person going cross road
many driverless car video going see car driving perfect road perfect condition theyre completely unadaptable variety terrain car might come across real world
hope honest captcha asked click square containing traffic light
quiet kid corner clicking everything traffic light
amazing comment
way prove youre machine proving youre stupid enought
nihilsum get math problem wrong let u
nihilsum user would move mouse click rate would erratic bot doesnt move mouse across screen click like finger touchscreen thats measurable difference
im fascinated autonomous vehicle technology seems quite absurdly american public transportation already resolve desire drive commute room improvement public transportation poor america think american think term car however another thought become commonplace america likely driver prefer drive purely enjoyment
need grow network car would even safer car car b would communicate anticipation turn would waiting time car even fuel efficient highway driving ant line close together whenever first car needed brake others would also brake making use air flow efficient use space car also give ticket bad driver maybe
illegal common people drive car next year mark word hate fall civilization rome nothing going happen next year
urban planning put parking garage spot dont want put main drag cross sidewalk cause potential accident slows traffic wait turn dont want put deserted side street people likely get mugged side street walk farther get back main street shop car drop pick sidewalk main street suddenly move parking main street side street free space main drag shop imagine mall could sit right road shop side street could create old style dense walkable main street could move parking rear let car go car could queue next available space virtual list instead circle lot looking space long line curb parking already better meter let park le defined space let put car along curb smaller vehicle line parked automated car could park closer together could navigate tighter space driver vehicle never really left vehicle car could virtually say excuse give extra foot space car block could move couple inch give space car dropping people could even get rid special purpose parking bos doesnt need spot car going valet automated wouldnt even need handicapped spacing every destination essentially valet parking
video feel sciencebased relied heavily anecdote example small sample size would liked seen statisticsbased argument seems waymo tested ideal driving area like california phoenix arizona place ideal weather wide road without ton traffic polite driver etc convinced responsible human driver also wouldnt low accident rate condition derek try convince u average human driver bad driver talk human drive road hit stationary object etc might true suspicion large percentage due driver drive influence text drive drive sleepy etc skew distribution human driver safety right derek mention people think average driver think assuming safety human driver follows bell curve distribution skews right predict mean far median people fact better mean human driver follows baseline responsibility guideline im sure youre mean order convinced need see self driving driving car lower accident rate per billion mile median responsible sober awake texting human similar condition
thought exactly think waymo wrote whole script
problem human dont wait theyre sober responsible attentive get behind wheel question becomes assume driverless car reduce road crash fatality x go death per year control death werent driver would accept would every time hop plane step onto ship
issue human inconsistent unpredictable computer dont get drunk dont get tired think people drive better average real question often drive better average
mancatcheese thats well good need convince people use theyre drunk tired
samuelmundula doesnt matter much reduce fatality rate overall matter much reduce fatality condition want drive example possible reduce fatality x include condition hypothetically simultaneously double chance fatality alert driver heavy snow reduce overall fatality could still mean im increasing risk taking one heavy snow
would great see try get way traffic emergency vehicle detected
probably able communicate directly
sorry brother stop cant handle difference opinion issue something lot deeper harder explain concerning human condition foundation soul scruple principle thing people say show core direction world heading cant justify time listening people focused wrong direction cheer
crazy think lifetime fully autonomous vehicle norm maybe even one day fully autonomous airplane able take u wherever want well
car interior redesigned doesnt look weird driver supposed driver seat
imagine driver seat event human need take wheel could something like moving around maintenance floor could used testing purpose make sure steering brake working etc
except waymo definitely need watch video isnt waymo ad car get confused situation get slightly complicated waymo team human driver always around rescue stranded car
get older im looking forward technology maintain autonomy
pertinent comment people seem make point like think theyll young hypermobile forever
might send mum hopefully thisll convince
autonomous car excite imagine getting car going hour road trip might run thing car never get bored distracted never make mistake never fall asleep worst possibly happen car run fuel charge imagine car kitted equipment also detect wildlife predict action hard time seeing deer field driverless car look heat degree know animal getting close enough risk
use irl raytracing make image
elevator driver good research
one question dont address happens people drive living technology becomes cheaper implement paying people going lot people transition new career long haul trucker make enough money bit financial safety net theyre responsible people working grub hub door dash uber eats countless pizza chain grocery delivery service bus cab ups amazon dont think people much financial security company likely remorse putting people work arent careful introduce technology dont restrict fast company allowed adopt could another recession many people work
im sure nobody ever going see comment
people town terrible driver know skill deteriorated result believe im ready try autonomous vehicle become available area
every job related transportation industry need universal basic income
really cool video phoenix july
fear autonomous driving dont trust tech dont trust company software quality people think self driving car dont think google waymo think tesla elon musk full everytime tesla release update there hundred video posted youtube tesla selfdriving completely broken missing lane light hurt full autonomous driving opinion google company know still actually writes pretty high quality software whereas pretty much everything else sad barely holding together
really wish video wasnt paid sponsorship unfortunately creates biase opinion basically ad funny enough today able experience example im thinking live juarez el paso metropolitan area make u unique two city different nation literally walking distance away driving one city next already feel difference driving style however get worse youre heavy traffic area mix scenario im interested since propose real challenge decision making finally love drive would hate taken away side note prevent someone drive blasting emergency vehicle sound prank people sinister mind work suppose
company make car showing public real example vehicle able avoid obstacle icy road foggy condition heavy rainfall condition arent dry urban road summer otherwise course people going want get one also run red light pay ticket also also elevator arent danger hitting elevator
autonomous vehicle technology almost legislation many many decade away thats wont see fully autonomous vehicle becoming mainstream long time insure case accident blame ai developer car company
think one main problem camera need kept clean wouldnt hard annoying
driverless racing car ill know safe mean lift city building go level second speed factor
first time atomism semi hit atomism school bus pollution reject drive living safe also work autism semi technology four year master driver many atomism driving system research development weather greatly effected vision site ice snow rain bug high wind caused lall unit stop pull side road default mode construction zone could navigate technology available commercial transportation yet huge condition change long haul route valley sun ideal weather love try one even master driver ride cross country
im car autonomous dont trust stupid driver hitting car also would make public transportation better course would better environment future mass transit car industry doesnt want also would affect insurance industry see thats hard move forward country company much power government doesnt step make best decision good make good
work north winter snow road
sadly waymo us lidar highly detailed map centimeter really lazy nonscalable approach
julia profile want safety u dont want use hd map lidar google cant map every single road millimeter keep updated lidar cant see difference plastic bag tire
concern carjackers standing front autonomous car partner rob passenger
car camera going hit woman squashed crossing street bike arizona begs differ yes self driving car still least year away self driving car still make lot really bad decision safer one day driving best condition best road still fail time time
transportation service
liability biggest thing holding autonomous car back come manufacturer responsible accident theyd get sued oblivion
talk many cumulative mile driven much experience theyve comparison always contrived apple apple comparison major benefit human brain learn drive explain dont make certain decision given event aiml world provide thousand million example hope computer infer right outcome given set input im certainly excited autonomous vehicle think theyre future lot analogy comparison made regarding experience flimsy best
question ive always car loses control tire pop hydroplane ect hit pedestrian kill law place protect company made driverless car sued would like accident insurance company handle damage compensation
alright camera good get blocked mud snow bird poo etc even lidar get blinded even radar problem everyone adaptive cruise control drove snowy weather know mean
criterion bad driving people died road related death thats caused death autonomous car would good thing sure however rest u nonmanslaughterers nonessential also keep mind place didnt even stop sign early decade evolving would helpful getting bad driver road
living silicon valley ive seen lot waymo van ive seen pretty impressive thing impressive mind involving driver hot boxing car two lane road drove behind hotboxer could immediately spot situation driving slower traffic slightly erratic albeit within lane waymo van pulled next slowed refusing pas hotboxer opting drive speed limit car turned point waymo sped back speed continued spent long time thinking variable code must led make determination would seem car driving speed limit andor exceeding level movement within lane algorithm pas car could obviously see cabin full smoke could make decision based would deem fairly subtle difference normal driver would drive potential hazard would drive
sale car paid insurance legal responsibility guess technology came stay going bankruptcy soon case dont trust programmer apps
revisionist history great podcast
dont trust car dont trust human driver
absolutely cant wait take people suck driving traffic would non existent
follow tesla fsd beta ride along see exactly close true full self driving ready road general mapped area
driverless car go command command stop immediately commanded certain entity much looking forward former freedom road becoming straightforward mode rendition authority pretended offense
would use car dont annoying select square stop sign captchas
whats chase vehicle behind u
question ask myselfthat make doubt upcoming autonomous car live handle snow ground hide line handle snow dirt salt covering camera instrument
think average wonder research quantified ig nobel publication perhaps back natural bias wonder wonder
like nightmare except didnt end well probably fear handing control cant really imagine comfortably getting driverless car cause dont trust ai dont trust people either everyone go driverless dont software run technology there fear exploited criminal end someone manages set rule responding certain situation car would run someone crossing street curve group pedestrian law surrounding responsibility lie something go wrong happens driver license become obsolete people still need know drive car seems reach certain level automation car interior might change altogether might driver seat anymore maybe wont even way people drive car interesting think see actually implemented large scale simply period therell inevitably driverless traditional car road time im afraid human error add lot randomness le well designed system might able handle initially might arrogant think would hand control ai situation step far currently
wonder happens vehicle start hydroplaning gliding ice patch
traction control system since handle slippery condition better human
derek many different name going give video
someone tell music start
lidar radar thing tesla isnt using problem tesla seems face autonomous driving dont use different type sensor dont input arent skipping lv famously dont avoid running stationary object
vehicle waymo experience human driver
""
truly man dan
hermit put way
hermit hang got ta switch manual override gas gas gas intensifies
hermit yup every day someone chasing seriously much illegal stuff fear caught car chasing
traffic look pretty light place like los angeles new york city
u say itsnear happen data people transportation going handlewhen emergency manual drive mode company see data happen company get hacked people road get killed ill intention
brazilian accent though
creates driverless bicycle
think big part driverless resistance bad experience machine quality day day experience filled technological failure computer error phone glitch ice cream machine breaking mcdonalds people familiar getting frustrated technology frustration often cultivated company trying get people buy stuff low quality break often customer buy created culture technology unreliable unreliable translates unsafe heck even new computer got k issue
bad weather want plane flying self aircraft flying self autopilot system designed reduce pilot workload take high wind autoland unavaliable approach talked could easily done pilot manually impressive called il approach
perfect example dont take youtubers word go homework lazy narcissist wish could throw data dont like present support view ive already adopted people rant rave another commenter noted blatant error made footage video presented kind computational sophistication ai intelligence matter need semiotic understanding driving quite literally order perform correctly inb neural net simulate complex situation pretty much perfectly crowd tantamount gigantic leap ai technology lead believe justified speculation require revolutionary understanding human consciousness charlatan really really want believe precipice understanding estimation nowhere near close satisfying scientific explanation human consciousness
one attempting defend safety driver time sdc hit killed jaywalker anyone day two safety driving going lose focus made relying human attentive time giving actual task perform never good move im glad see waymo accepts basic reality eliminated position curious question selfdriving car arizona california license plate built registered california shipped driven phx shakedown testing there possibility car may sent back california see logic keeping plate theyre sure since possible register outofstate car california mile odometer experience insurance carrier also willing look way people dont immediately transfer registration theyre supposed move ca often bind one law say transfer within day another say cant mile
please stop saying small chance unrealistic trolley accident happening impossible scenario approaching personsvehicleswhatever good visibility hit goddamn break one get hurt scenario approaching personsvehicleswhatever bad visibility drive slowly break time driving fast condition first place one get hurt scenario object appear thin air within breaking distance nothing argue autonomous car break much quickly human human would hit anyways autonomous car prevent accident impossible minimizes injury due faster response time therefore slower impact tldr car break use trolley problem hogwash created spread fear uncertainty doubt imho anyone bringing relation autonomous vehicle idiot
change society going even greater think motor vehicle automated many reason people going first place start getting phased imagine fleet automated delivery vehicle would way life first youll see big retailer start closing brick mortar storefront think youll see technology start enable smaller local business
technology cant come fast enough worry canada delayed weather
technology isnt coming fast waymo struggling phoenix city perfect road perfect weather perfect infrastructure designed car completely scanned area operate trip rail everything preplanned despite waymo car still need human driver following case cant handle situation
le year away middle mediumlarge city
dont worry autonomous car worry driver people car would lot safer
also limited set safe route time looong way general utility
cute driverless car driver seatbelt buckled
almost impossible computer predict infinite number variable road there always unsuspected thing happen end day computer good programming something fails going good thing unfortunately car always going deadly thing error always happen infinite variable cause death true human driver getting worse obeying rule regulation set forth road help keep people safe adding computer mix still seem safe think computer time modern car failing getting glitch problem happens selfdriving car outcome could bad
mass transit better cycling infrastructure walkable city thats want
well sure thats obvious best idea every single way going get investor scam local government
agree unfortunately automotive industry sabotage attempt capitalism keep getting way obviously good idea
preach
mass transit cant support
dont forget crash
big time deja vu cgpgreys old video said driving car already argument rhetoric eerily similar yet like decade poke fun people saying least year away
yeah wouldve good ask theyre widely used already tech good video implies rule regulation actually technical improvement need made
blackcap ask interview explain mostly people hesitant hesitation also filter rule regulation get made people need see thing happen often place order comfortable sociological barrier technological one
uncontrolled crossing idea seems unlikely unless planning tell people theyre allowed cross street without expensive metal box
could put path bridge tunnel basicly metro station place
still cross light pedestrian make car stop crossing walking time
pedestrian press button like already city
driver average compared everyone world
reason dont trust driverless car gps ive used none update local road lived next roundabout nearly year still think intersection always try reroute road always damaged frequently drive dirt road order trust driverless car road gps systmes updated monthly maintained monthly notification unlikely improbable road change deteriorate think tech great safe dont think road system gps system ready
one ever mention secure thing great getting better average human driver happens bad actor control fleet thing
interesting technology never get fully automous vehicle dont necessarily trust technology simply actually enjoy driving find fun would want replace fun boring
one misleading video pretty disappointed honest well good driven around brand new vehicle thats checked year time ten year thats sensor start problem pcbs start showing dry joint etc noticed didnt touch software bugsglitches please dont tell theyre tested much wont happen itll take one bug literally hundred thousand could die brought comparison aircraft flown boeing max lately im sure software far testing self driving car compare elevator complexity self driving car ridiculous cant believe
clamoring driverless car
tempe
good technology real question responsibility employing working people drive car fall justice would done company producing autonomous car could adapt people lose job worry monetary part
well handle parking nonroaddriving maneuver thats part always trouble imagine also trouble autonomous car might struggle thinking specifically navigating parking lot job spot many client coming going often car lot
professional driver late im sick current worsening state driving culture cant look window without seeing distracted driver passed driver illegaldangerous situation time hour work day quite honestly sick saving g someone el life stupid self centeredme first mentality people driving little idea k pound truck vehicle education go far driving caring make difference perfect driving knowrealize make mistake mtoministry transportation ontario certified signing authority trained evaluate driver determine meet standard commercial driverspecifically school bus even though changed job still maintain critical observation others driving
think much easier would cut break car political dissident
bigger picture need reduce dependency car need rethink city suburb give back people driverless cool even cooler le car street
computer thousand million time smarter human everything automated work accident unless someone hack system
watchdog wont game anymore
cope motorcycle
people think average driver assumption everyone average abhorrent would make math work nothing really think wrong
wow thing think got tear eye born first computer vic teenager downloaded mp kbps half hour sekhour truck driver since cant wait get truck buy many bank think spend rest life couch
could add green city lol whats stopping regulator start realize city people car theyll add building green area
one bit future cant shake thought someone hacking
find ridiculous many people rule selfdriving car statistic havent driven enough accident theyve already itll obviously get worse like idea youre talking ive conversation point ratio accidentspermile severity accident lower autonomous vehicle already basically say dont want machine deciding accident get like driving much im like youd rather accident human fault ego conversation loop well thats assuming theyre good enough anyways people really stubborn come accepting autonomous tech always wanting make excuse bottom line nobody want feel invalidated technology technology make life easier realize mean worry important thing instead triviality say driving someone drive skill arent invalidated autonomous vehicle even youre driver driving isnt specialized skill feel invalidated tech move find something else youre holding back anybody
like execute perfect shift rpm honda prelude vtec
definitely ai intuition driving requires intuition matter smart make computer quick reflex never able handle bizarre situation come time traffic best like better version train predictable route predictable issue never able get unstuck sliding road blizzard fixing flat tire stopping help someone need thats scratching surface many thing ai never handle
question would pilot take control landing scenario use plane computer bad scenario scenario
im even going bother watching im dead set driverless car form lane assist yes collision avoidance yes dont want driverless car around thing computer hacked backdoored even autonomous vehicle hacked seems start people willing swallow garbage cant figure
like idea dont think theyre close ready thought theyd year ago jumbo jet vastly different car handful jumbo jet world compared number car even small city million dollar worth sensor computer automation would practical car normal person could hope afford buy new self driving car radar lidar driving computer k accident rate least lower human driver technology mature enough use
human focused long time like sleepy distracted drunkbut driverless car focus consistently long time
follow cleverly devised story told coming lord jesus christ power eyewitness majesty peter know son god come given u understanding may know true true son jesus christ true god eternal life john
wouldnt consider waymo fully autonomous theyre useless outside geofence require literal team monitoring car inside said geofence
honestly id rather better public transport le car
making place le car dependent would solve number issue even faster also making easier adopt driverless car world doesnt need driverless car much need carless driver
im sure time probably coming soon think ill miss driving pretty fun honest
sure anyone would want driving gone
tnant sake safety human driver seem fault often
im control freak hate anyoneanything else driving would get firm definition average driver declare im like control vehicle even cant control anything around said issue self driving car make sound like need dont disagree company going sell need price theyll sell luxury price right place ride public transit absolute joke widespread self driving car going take long time
back age controlled car hand lot people died didnt care got wanted faster
love idea feel like would never able afford one though afford buy thing work im still driving year old truck simple reason rebuild heck im second engine k mile
derek glad put clip cpgs video people see watching content haha course clearly show problem design infrastructure hope letys dream come true would love world waymo many others envision year great job always derek
question beggining claimed autonomous car ready good infrastructure using airplane automatic really tough situation human handle isnt comparison going point talking
id imagined driverless taxi common couple treat hotel wheel unless operator regularly cleaned theyll smell like brothel
carmers might put dent scenario many taxi already
cl melonshark isnt already thing called fake taxi xd
cant imagine average person ever able afford cost associated new technology
correct
tech great wonder driver would replaced
get isnt going get speedtickets happens cop pull
imagine could walk front car fear ded
never case even computer instantly notice applies full force brake car still take certain amount timedistance stop increase speed couldnt step ft front car going mph
roronoahope become greatest swordsman beat mihawk soon
hexcodeff making drive around like river around stone unless car coming way well road wet many thing
hexcodeff lot traffic nowhere car move except road car beside
hexcodeff got done saying car moving fast enough close enough even slow wont time come stop hitting road full wont anywhere move way dont get wrong car good avoiding collision scenario besides full road could probably communicate merging accelerating solution avoid never time safe run traffic scenario
funny never mention tesla autopilot time show fatal accident autonomous vehicle show tesla
impossible machine make im auto car impossible bit stretch
cyber security would possible hack one car control remotely
step get people driver seat let go want step decide go
system look well thought lot sensor including lidar radar worry video kinda make driverless car time company want sensor possible agree particular car seems safe worry one dont want people car lower level automation seeing video think pay le attention comparison plane elevator find bit disingenuous since feedback higher signal noise ratio much involve sensor fusion waymo car appreciate content creator take sponsored video also reputation going bottom thing get impression like disclose beginning sponsored easy forget minute video fall back reputation another disingenuous argument human make mistake machine doesnt machine made human programmed human mistake still happen fact fully deployed automatic system systemic mistake may far greater consequence individual human making individual mistake would comparatively easy fully autonomous car didnt worry human driven car pedestrian animal debris think safe fully autonomous car point think important progress slowly high demand company providing vehicle dont think good solution get rid human driver completely think valuable freedom able get around accord remove human driven car maybe also get rid bicyclist suddenly live sort maze cant get around unless take great risk crossing road nobody expected cross fund permission use option left u sponsored video would interesting done experiment flash blue light car play loud siren sound fake roadsigns think good job video well produced kept interesting dont like felt like opinion piece hurry legislation favor waymo rather objective take
parome binary choice argument could mandate people live entire life padded cell turn around say freedom important safety regulation much loss life sort balance tradeoff freedom safety edit typo
parome extreme used highlight point hard find proper balance freedom safety
parome let agree disagree
driverless car dont perfect better human already
dont want google controlling even life anymore want corporate distopia company care externality veritassion turned b propaganda
whats happens several lidarequiped car see isnt interference laser beaming place
parome ok make sense random sequence pulse interfere much communication vehicle true car still need capture image surrounding everything autonomous vehicle
make dense rail maybe chain bunch together
worst video last month spend time ever comment section plenty people pointing different drawback optimistic advertisement many link missing video unsolid argument focus selling specific vibe actually teaching u something despite positive relation u advertisement company product like channel long time fan video standard quality expecting please move past incident focus educationally content le selling product work heck even want sell something least make fair trial look negative side ask hard question investigate sellingpoints actually hold true critical eye pass willing trust case critical eye education search plain
dont want drivable car go away though ill sad love driving
maybe born soon
drunk driver hit head car compound fracture leg bone sticking skin really feel give selfdriving car chance know sure almost everyone know someone heard story friend family member dying car accident know bit scary think selfdriving car help save lot life
still nervous elevator couple hundred year
elevator really insane failsafes rare one suffers catastrophic failure case one failsafes installed make near impossible itll result horrible accident inventor actually purposefully induced catastrophic failure inside front crowd prove point theyve gotten better since die elevator accident youre probably luckiest unluckiest person world experience incredibly rare event
mirunanero know safe heck also know rare case fail absolutely nothing change fate hand door close til im thats disconcerting
mirunanero also injury death lol
poletooke mean thats case thing fact life moreover hand youd put danger trust machine much youd like doesnt change fact human comically bad judgement even one mistake kill kind thing
live asian country ton asshole driver violating law giving way pedestrian even braketesting road trust computer idiot day cant wait driver seat
live phoenix derek meet greet
think driving car fun want self driving car option like better uber maybe like drive car regardless ability cu enjoy
argument driverless vehicle mean le accident inherently flawed million driver road driverless vehicle thats order magnitude greater law big number arent enough number driverless vehicle conpare im worried normal driving condition im worried bad patch get deployed k accident happen overnight strange edgecase code im worried training set corruption bias human error driving mean potential collision human error autonomous vehicle mean potential million collision there also case power surge knock computer cheap capacitor used save cost blow short motherboard psus common fault computer say well vehicle fail safe stop youre parking break coast long there traffic ahead youre obstacle middle highway vehicle mph past show handle derek b puff piece paid mechanical electrical failure extremely common vehicle didnt even mention
derek thank content topic simple since technology exponentially advanced short time help bring u date
put dummy driver seat call johnny cab
yal ever drive houston hope make human driving illegal
get basic idea lidar dont know actually work would possible lidar two separate autonomous car interact therefore given data otherwise wouldnt expect
totally autonomous car human driver get worse worse every year driving skill depend daily mental physical condition fact allow car better predict traffic interweave adjust speed way advance stopandgo scenario going life changer literally human suck many thing hate admit already kind technology especially spaceship became totally necessary travelling kmh cruising speed kmh city planetary travel course interplanetary lot faster fast time react trust even space get quite crowded trying dodge ship debris satellite meteorite
people poll last week even expecting make video saying autonomous driving vehicle arent good yet dont understand people arrogant suck literally everything trusted something powerful motor vehicle
waymo dont trust vehicle people supervising remotely
brendonwood theyre still much better driving supervisor watching every move drive
brendonwood mean even watch video handed content showing completely incorrect yet still believe correct
toomanyfrancis content waymo ad understand difference example reason people crashing stationary car near back slam nrakes near pedestrian causing like video wasnt mentioned
technology open world elderly folk folk disability mentioned wanted flying car lol happy first step
autonomous work vehicle would enable get desk work done long drive job site
many advantage autonomous vehicle already achieved autonomous train
oohputain like train fellow passenger would appreciate several hundred pound ladder tool equipment box cable etc would pile seat around course getting job site hundred mile nearest train station would problematic travel rail u satisfies need small segment population
designing city taking count autonomous car imagine smooth traffic every car controlled ai mean like every driver read others driver mind time longer wasted intersection
rita yo check vid damm pfp
rita yo check vid design city make easier accurately gps work
short answer people stupid people stupid people driverless car overall much safer know thats exactly positive live city tell last time drove ten minute without encountering form stupid ill wait im gon na hold breath
human driving forbidden right autonomous car allowed current technology accident would greatly reduced inertia thinking resistance change presumption cost u many human life
arent utopia happen anytime soon car vehicle extension ego owner human always want override bot road rage satsfying many driver simply driving get point point b driver becoming worse bc many potential danger taken care car little concept defensive driving anymore bot hit anything supposed fault system acceptable nyc maybe ac forget
honestly want one travel intoxicated sleep passenger
mean like people say biggest problem job tech taken away thing get automated simpler job gone
cat iii requires lot ground infrastructure advanced equipment aircraft trained pilot cockpit sort infrastructure existed road car yes bring autonomous car
seems biggest threat area identifying roadweatherexterior condition responding emergency
probably break keeping safe dependable road get perfecting response algorithm thing go wrong light contrast road fall beneath ahead thing people falling way etc
comparing elevator driverless car bahahahah pick train rail
look terribly written consumer software yet want goober engineer let loose device kill people delusion strong
without automobile accident far le organ transplant
would handle heavy rain semi flooding city due backed storm drain would assume water service road submerging car
sooner get people moment moment decision making traffic better
there reason testing scottsdale arizona ideal weather let know handle poor road condition visibility doesnt matter many camera see nothing
dont want commute cant wait sit back work way way back heard first guy driverless car work longer hour actually enjoy commute love driving
doubtful sure could possible work commute wouldnt necessarily become mandated far likely reducing hour increasing pay future thr vast majority time worked used busy work
company isnt paying ride im working rather sleep driven
reeeee thats supra
analogy stepping autonomous car compared elevator really make think hadnt even thought way id never thought stepping elevator unnatural part thats quite interesting take
manual driving become impermissable get permission go somewhere allowed sit car like potato arriving destination sit like potato new spot later ask permission go back im sorry vehicle available dont watch movie
finally thank video valuable someone like big city dont want drive
adays plane like map high detalied runway etc pilot land like want use faster calculating computer job
cant wait vehicle autonomous somebody group people shut entire system via hacking cause vehicle crash kidnap people also there value owning vehicle everybody want share vehicle everybody else want independence hygiene reason driver autonomous vehicle know passenger cleaned known need cleaned dont want enter one autonomous vehicle see coated vomit never bothered report making vehicle sensor stop able crash brake suddenly want rely drive way better way human machine fail far le likely one thing
hmm love video one big commercial
office look like horrible workplace im driverless car company remote least office software engineering work specially open office tell theyre one driverless car remote work job done computer part equation reduce emission create green space reduce noise improve safety quality life general
good ex hack system send cliff
happens car sensor problem road
honestly cant trust safety assessment product thats sponsored product developer sorry
future cant come fast enough
self driving unlikely replace car ownership least u arent population dense enough cover reasonably sized fleet people wont willing wait minute curb grocery store anywhere else probably even minute absolutely blessing urban area since public transportation also awful
let realistic greed going ruin hell
already starting hear bit car staying parked lol want use car ferry people around
ive driven well million kilometre one thing say driving robot human terrible driver
delicious lady
got tripped cause siren video going past house
one active radar right dont trust tesla camera system
silly argument bring scientifically guided person clearly conceivable even better average driver long absolutely catastrophical driver road far outlier simple assumption make driving skill following nice uniform gaussian distribution considering factor like age distribution increasing socioeconomic differenceswealth inequality influencing thing like driving education understanding physic eg typically unintuitive breaking timesdistance driving speed would say normally distributed ofc dunning kruger may loosely apply case driving contextualizing finding exampleleading question well guided making good tv show imho come man dont like
maybe future isnt far afterall
yeah wonder easily vehicle hack attack system last time knew easy hack computer normal vehicle newer one like tesla etc
could youve mentioned also riding bicycle thats got american way solving urbanism problem america design
id rather ride bicycle degree weather trust ive done necessity terrible
take one step let get velomobiles mass production state europe already theyre basically unknown u
thats good solution dont cargo arent going far hot cold course city even suburb make nonstarter thing far apart
bike sound like good idea realize place need mile away weather change quicklyextremely there infrastructure public transport wouldnt effective reason like carrying large item pet privacy etc
honestly urban sprawl anywhere outside europe problem look city built advent car bad u besides car arent going away time soon might well reduce number road renting car needed make safer process basically would ondemand mass transit everyone regardless lived think uber without driver could conceivably made electric gas car reserved extremely long trip
ok great make video explain develop driverless car instead good public transport
hope figure deal pot hole british road terrible
tesla technology way ahead waymo please waymo scalable
thanks sure great technology time practical like drive
im driver ive many car accident always human error thats nice way say someone asshole fear driveless car safe quite ironic think main advantage driveless car security also sleep work laptop example instead driving would definitely help productive
know could solve safety issue car public transportation
taxi look future good year going great
derrick bring interesting point think really come fact people trolley problem back head even havent heard trolley problem rather idea individual blame case something go wrong troublesome even likelihood something going wrong first place much lower
sure want driverless vehicle corner cut ai safety feature company trying turn profit make idea inexcusably unsafe capitalist society ever driverless vehicle ethically road maybe cuba take goal car safely get people point point b one piece rather give toyota gmc much money little cost possible driverless vehicle
honestly point trust driverless car driver many damn bad driver ive seen
cant wait see video waymo car navigating delhi cairo
k dislike people think better driver automatic driver
make indicator sound inside vehicle asking vertigo
reason dont want mixing autonomous car human driver make advantage go away dont live grid city computer dont well alley narrow corner construction going saw top gear know one guy named keith service carand destroy perceived safety perfect system
year max normal
hyoomon driver must eliminated hyoomons imperfect biological unit make error error error
im sorry cant good faith trust information isnt biased due sponsership im proautomateddriving feel like much feel like sponsorship prevented downside mentioned also think disingenuous pretend like perfect solution everything flaw refusing admit hurt argument
every future car shoot invisible lidar beam place confuse car plus danger getting ran parent wont teach kid fear vehicle people stand road often holding traffic everyone late meeting plus thug damage car person confront maybe
ayyy wendover production
owning cheap used car day go want go want store move whatever want cost tend come large chunk unknown amount drive car even tired thing day average includes many day dont drive bus service day pay using minute cat nap prep work get mind work instead stressing driving particularly comfortable easy mi bus running little early running late often limited pickup drop time destination may route hope driverless car subscription would somewhere two cost something like day able service multiple people per day afford comfortable ride turning nice profit company especially averaged fleet easily maintained vehicle cheap insurance contrast uber lyft charge day tip direction miss bus wife need car day granted typically one way take bus back wonder would charge need guaranteed private vehicle need something pick random stuff home depot big box store need monopolize vehicle hour store stuff shopping still make cheap cheaper buying maintaining car time destination flexibility car man id sold already sold tech safety aspect need make available make affordable
replacing human driver self driving car going improve thing way reduce traffic reduce number car though thats going require city designed lot better ie designed car
naah real question isnt ability make selfdriving car theyve developing stuff sicne darpa race real question isnt people believe car big scheme thing thats almost irrelevant real question car maker believe system enough tak legal responsibility driver put future time doubt willing
team tesla waymo expensive much le flexible nice video hope expand area limit
thats amazing im looking forward
car able drive dealing human being
id prefer le car road pedestrian bike infrastructure
lazy leftist libtars would fully autonomous bike cant kind work get tired weak
autonomous train
im intrested selfdriving car dont trust goverments scumbag tech company hold power tell go hong kong shut metrothe main mode transport protest going see
bring one santo domingo make learn get experience need ever
want work company question said camera sensor detects everything good weather raining foggy camera penetrate rain fog case much camera range reduce leaf something else get stuck thing turn time second
derek saying disagree people drive living taxi truck driver delivery driver chauffeur massive influx people wont job go government need plan place think technology inevitable need consider affect
nope car soul
like car enjoy driving
think could still would become recreational driving way like people recreational horse riding
starty appear hidden agenda big tech car company want citizen able car drive already stated want money control day youre born till day die
offroadjhdo thats interesting point view way see company want sell product buildsell product appeal consumer previous model competitor model highly doubt consumer buy car little control term ownership personally grantee im going buy new car cant take local national park local racetrack bit fun incentive company something consumer there simple solution dont buy product nobody going force self driving car
starty agree unfortunately time consumer choice use manufacturer provides go without car manufacturer need make vehicle charged several time daily ride one subscription base product generate revenue product headed company love fee membership fee profit zero liability take group tour national park new future personally believe self diving car beginning end national freedom control free man government like hope retain mix vehicle america
want want balanced critically engaged youtube content
know could summon driverless car pick need carpool
driverless car dont perfect better human theyve long time screw one grandma v puppy argument anyone making stupid
right distraction
selfpiloting almost thirty year ago father pilot shirt said real pilot dont type even far back commercial flight largely typing destination car arent far away
except autonomous capable plane still pilot car still driver even year
im driverless car honestly really want driverless city
carless city moreso
thats goal would hope
car take fun city
driverless car replace taxi driver million driver unemployed
sanskartopg yup like elevator driver poor guy still dont work outlawed think wonder survived time
dont trust selfdriving car dont trust people road
asks profoundly important question autonomous vehicle always pick answer get waymo car road sooner self driving car video crash even tesla yea fluff commercial sell go back loot box crate co
rejecting automation one looking someone blame
think favourite use would driverless car spot traffic warden start go round block come back warden moved
im really afraid cyber attack crashing self driving car sudden apart great
waymo use high definition map curated hard scale outside city changing road condition tesla approach using visiononly much faster broad adoption million overall future nearly ai cool
channel basically suck ball whoever pay became quite hard trust
driverless car never work city world
lidar animation misleading first line sight object seen one back could inferred tracked realtime yet see thru type glass windshield much
tesla little mile belt little
need prevent driverless car becoming thing help control population interesting
long see cop show depicting murder planned infiltrating equivalent waymo dispatch team long happens real sure mention inspiration interview trial
driving phoenix easy road grid try driving roundabout england
roundabout u rocket science computer smarter average person
autonomous car commuting gasoline car fun
self driving car cool im never going give motorcycle lol
feel car able drive better people another big question large percentage population job driving truck driver taxisubers delivery vehicle etci could see automated future people job
really loved said majority car accident due human distraction irresponsibility think tend get caught potential shortcoming autonomous vehicle forgot fear stem mistake driver
would really unfortunate there significant number driver equivalent antivaxxers antimaskers refuse make use selfdriving vehicle despite better track record antiself driver would causing majority crash road
real problem information age disinformation age
decision making let say car going short entrance ramp highway pretty crowded highway trying merge human competence make hard decision either slowing finding space merge maybe wasnt enough space pull shoulder whatever driverless car cant code make stay within line conflict guess im saying conflict human human le car coinciding showed end video car autonomous would safer human human le together
freeway near upgraded recently tangle white yellow line road sign saying obey yellow line id curious know driverless car didnt specific circumstance programmed like human driver didnt would make
dont think self driving car focusing goal safety effeciency north american investing high speed train metro system car always part society believe importance overblown
blaming traffic people getting work late object
dont want autonomous vehicle one simple reason im driving feel horrific entire journey usually throw couple mile
cant take pill
seraph nope work people others unfortunately fall others category
seems like solution search problem like driving desire one
million plus people killed automobile every year caused human error thats problem think worth solving
accident happened say driver perfect
real solution lower traffic fatality commute time removing car build better public transport city try increase population density already proven work country like netherlands cool money could spent effectively tried tested method find shame people stupid suburb dont even seem consider viable alternative
opinion plane train automation nice car something different human road many human ignorant as license bet bar something plane land safely human air mostly problem driver license way easy get compared terrain like air many human around chance failure make mistake automated driving higher automated car would drive around id use human could ruin
get pulled driverless car still probable cause search
lifetime could see end drunk driving accident bet government still give duis anyway similar silly get duo simply sitting sleeping car intoxicated much money
problem waymos approach requires high detailed map expensive sensor much expensive typical car roll hopefully within next year big city probably year reasonable priced vehicle within area kind technology daily route unless live highly populated city america seems like year still good estimate
would good hear thing progressing like shopping bag blow across street av overbrakes avoid overbraking cause problem behind accident one two five ten car back improvement going rain fog snow road construction traffic cone people directing traffic line road repainted crosswalk moved etc
sorry derek second said video sponsored waymo love video certainly one best educational youtuber nothing coming topic featuring sponsor video agree making money important reach wider audience excuse come keeping integrity dont want sound harsh stopped watching video exact moment certainly lost one interested viewer strategy
issue self driving car road fact still people driving road
yes human problem cause accident
nobody ever want touch topic road condition weather condition think cant get autonomous vehicle able calculate predict reaction thing accurately yet either dont talk dont enough data yet considering majority experience vehicle simulation
technology grows people become useless
use force luke
disagree derek dont want autopilot flying bad weather want flying poor visibility autopilot terrible responding wind shear inconsistency compared human pilot yes automation help ensure consistent adherence checklist item automation faulty programming also cause issue max badly want see fully autonomous driving like viewer also think still year away unfortunately inconsistency across road condition live driver road animal mean autonomous driving safe human driver perfect average driver trust enough send kid school automated schoolbus
former mechanic almost every single car road since capability drive decide turn technology mechanic really calibrate camera calibration stay lane even self calibrating people need get old technology future coming quicker think
yeah nah thats gon na hard pas wont trust computer program life family life extremely irresponsible say mistake impossible computer make bull shite really sad thing one rise machine nightmare malfunction kill family freeway oh well theyre still safest way blahblahblah human factor isnt factor anymore thats sad scary time
video big ad waymo
dont like dont want cant make dont care work year show handling sudden failure first show kinetic energy self organizes prevents injury failure show adapting whole lane falling away getting blocked show full intersection blockage system look like could kill lot people quickly
fare suicidal poodle recognize pedestrian pet would take driverless taxi manned one taxi driver crazy
bug code decide life dy
think people trust beat professional thing like race rally able barely even safer people average wont enough
stopped allowing horse road long time ago happen driven car
horse allowed everything except motorway dont see allowed
shouldnt want driverless bomb could seriously used assassination tool
autonomous vehicle could save life mass adopted better average driver average driver statistic includes everybody including drunk driver distracted driver speeder personally adopt autonomous vehicle would better person drive sober time text drive drive aggressively tailgate etc
two driverless car meet intersection hello old chum allow give way old chap allow give way may pas may pas allow give way insist go first part programming give way oncoming traffic please insist also part programming give way traffic spongebob narrator voice three hour later f insist go first f go first passenger call customer support looking back driverless car banked behind hi carlos um think car network nervous breakdown
bad weather there benefit human access info worse pilot bad weather flight done watching sensor rather outside good weather pilot see thing plane
auto flying plane still people controlling part think self driving car follow similar bit person control command change lane turn right park hold lane make good sense
improve public transport much easier much cost effective much le impact environment much self driving car cool theyre impractical faze car together faze bicycle train bus especially better sidewalk
people average driver x good still powerful point necessarily false
arent people ever talking autonomous car could communicate inform seeing would make whole lot safer
u like drive take bus train dont want drive make cab driverless
wish known going phoenix would offered buy lunch return chat love
im pretty sure pedistrian though car would continue car got scared hit breakes surprising manner
given hit back car id say probably right car stopped doesnt mean didnt cause
inside world first fully autonomous vehicle still open door hand
pacifica definitely remote power door love mine cool see waymo use excellent vehicle
autonomous car automatic door annoying hell situation unless disabled
correct title want car road
wishful thinking doesnt help reduce environmental impact selfdriving car
thats cool dont want like driving maybe im elderly
depends price lidar get cheaper vehicle become accessible
want noww
disabled veteran id heartbeat would absolutely fantastic selfreliant
im curious well work winter environment problem theyre long away make reliable adverse condition
im looking forward future much safer although legal issue thing go wrong need worked people really stupid come risk blame miss act driving car ownership traffic jam
ive never seen elevator run anyone pilot important part aircraft flying safer driving let know flying full size manned quadcopter youll definitely attention waiting pilot
dumb question waymo car super loud dereck filming loud place
long maintained weak link driving isthe driver autonomous car norm everyone near road safer
ya remote hacking also thing idk country wish mess country manner would one thing endanger life people
driverless vehicle becomes widespread u idiot protest demand road human vehicle
problem speced many system function theyll spend time workshop part expensive well owned two car period year ive replaced reverse camera twice vehicle imagine camera car roughly probability failure
personally car geek driving whole lot experience could never see living without literally look forward late night drive almost every day
nice corporate propaganda science channel making video presenting actual argument wide adoption automated car enough strawman nonsense elevator analogy bunk get actual credible critic involved present rational opposition nolights crossroad end nightmare hell comment made security hacking nothing problem state corporate control nothing privacy nothing human autonomy
largest problem revolution waymo one example parented google hard time supporting idea owning waymo car know company owning clearly tracking recording movement behavior sell ad mind tech win book produced open transparent fashion might make argument reason shouldnt using youtube easily clearly different im choosing use app future mandated tech much like wouldnt use sawstop despite safety feature dont use built license tech tried lobby congress use
terrible video glossed real world problem like scalability bad weather tried way hard get ad coming expected even coverage fact overly positive sound like terrible sellout video
perfectly manageable problem real world problem would make riding cheap putting many car road
look pro none con like mentioned pilot crashed plane much safer autopilot landing doesnt talk happens problem system like happened boeing max hundred example guess thats way go video sponsored thats say technology isnt great definitely downside im sure
driverless car fun untill car refuzes take someplace make human driving illegal
yup
dont know guy got glimpse total recall first starting showing firefly minus uncanny valley operator course
truck driver u im road many hour time day day week get see kind stupid stuff people get road think fully autonomous car good idea sure think theyll help prevent accident especially big truck cause yall four wheeler loooove cut u brake check u hopefully provide much safer environment highway many concern first handle construction zone lane might clearly defined especially computer time drive shoulder get around closed lane closed road take detour road arent paved like gravel dirt back country road road covered much snow ice blend grassy median way tell edge road looking car ditch something ive deal truck yeah think theyre great idea personally feel like there still lot variable figure especially come poor weather road condition argument driverless elevator one thing nothing compared car elevator dont deal road construction closure snow ice rain deal two direction dont deal obstacle roadway dont even get started self driving truck everybody keep telling oh wont job year cause self driving truck yada yada fail realize much driving big rig sitting behind wheel making thing go forward lot stuff computer simply matter much program example flatbed truck computer gon na throw tarp load put bungee tighten strap untarp load even help forklift driver unload good luck getting shipper receiver store unload stuff enough trouble lot case getting unload u throw untarp tarp unstrap strap load well likely mention would handle basically go road construction site usually doesnt even defined road usually little barely wide enough path defined tire track previous heavy equipment basically personal vehicle taxi small vehicle think self driving car great idea still lot issue either clarify general public simply work maybe close im quite seeing yet self truck though absolutely lifetime anyway especially type trucking computer job flatbed trucker physically possibly
example elevator driver really making think topic thanks derek
meh live thirld world country never seen electriccar let alone self driving one technology faaar awar like humanity also car seem like would easy steal
snow though heated roof
interesting question car selfdriven would need road lamp headlight
telling people opinion preference way edit well technology yeah urban phoenix middle blizzard minnesota want impress people know place cameracensors cant see road line place might mapped gps etc edit smugly gloss ethical dilemma enthusiasm yeah thats simply dodging topic heavy amount bias stick actual science advocacy social change science influencers drive right cliff enthusiasm point derick miss agency incredibly important people take window v linux lot people loathe microsoft programmer telling want computer behave hate treated like child hate told think need lot people want computer technology general certain thing often doesnt line desk jockey possibly another nation side planet think right way prioritize social issue far removed fundamental view relating society politics micromanagement good theory much practice often go badly regardless wish management direct comparison roadway death question worth forcing people adopt easy dodge question dont place importance agency begin disclaimer im technology enthusiast love concept automated car however im taking desire trying rationalize something everyone feel thats becomes disturbing grotesque
never seen stop button lift
riding ella lorry driver next auto driving lorry come
tech good prevents idiot road
thats one longest ad ive ever watched youtube
car lidar dozen camera going affordable typical consumer going robotaxis geofenced commonly driven place nice weather always need nearby human supervisor never move people efficiently cheaply actual mass transit problem sponsored ad video channel like really cant honest actual shortcoming thing
next automated road rage
glad technology advanced point already ive dreamt since im ready
safe people believe rented suv driving assist liked idea approached area didnt work keep hand wheel dose likely end waking rescue crew medic police officer everywhere around false sense security driver alert drive safely year without single accident reliable cant drive youre better hiring driver killing someone crosswalk sensor failed didnt detect kid running ball far ready horrific series event waiting unfold pushed mass production
sorry dont like autonomous car like drive much
interestingly bad driver good accident free driver time
make bad
steffenpanning thats partly open question factually accident dangerous driving unusual unpredictable driving circumstance subjectively anything someone else disagrees
goalsplus driver refer really involved le accident better driver book
steffenpanning never said le accident also didnt say accident fulltime basis good driver arent involved accident
basically consideration people love driving taking pleasure away u
pretty sure still buy nonautonomous car bro
becomes common place still able drive joy im driverless car see always going safer thrill seeker nature take fun life life becomes worse rather better love driving ive spent life transport got million mile belt im sure im ready chauffeured around time
wonder driverless car thing collapse labor market end capitalism arent like million people working driver u
parome deficit spending work long look congressional budget office projected debttogdp ratio next year deficit spending producing diminishing return
parome government dealt past keynesian deficit spending ever since great depression rate government must spend money keep gdp growing rate per year accelerating government pick slack indefinitely capitalist growth inexorably drive economy towards automation collapse value currency
recently youtube started showing video channel focusing city planning must say recuding car together making better city seems like better goal improve traffic id also like see take various different type approach self driving
""
fully agree
watched end thats basically said would happen wider autonomous car adoption people longer car parking lot wont need exist street wont need many lane driving efficient autonomous driving reduce dependency car strange way lot automotive company becoming transportation company
stumbler mean would share car passenger
love walkable city life also every like get drive
im fully onboard autonomous vehicle im bit skeptical hooked network perform ballet video called cybersecurity attack would potentially deadly network hacked
there something wrong camera bottom left thought screen messed second got worried lol
didnt even notice
autonomous car mean drunk people behind wheel may may asleep
feel like safe autonomous car road safer well would like see ride share option people may want walk bus stop may still willing share ride pick rider home monthly subscription carpool small van would awesome
way drive road life would amazing
yep would amazing everytime snow rain construction work marking missing ect everything would shut
theowenmajor auto pilot vehicle word car oldest vehicle road
gmarmol huh point thing struggle manage perfect weatherroadsmarkings small section pheonix world automated vehicle wouldnt work
hear saying every vehicle recognized another like robot lol nothing smart vehicle actually incapable touching another high speed without light
would cool
let honest many human driver prepare many trolley problem situation might find
tricky situation human need prepare situation better dealing enough time think present trolley situation road almost always le second outcome present would need prepare something would control anyway thats dont autonomous vehicle manoeuvred computer millisecond computer plenty see situation calculate possible outcome plan manoeuvre execute precision computer need prepare totally capable decide since theyll whatever theyll programed decide morale want follow case
maskedpotatoes im reading correctly human driver better ai driver maneuvering ethical quandries slower reflex slower reflex allow human navigate trolly problem guiltfree would make sense limit ai reflex par typical human way ai never make decision morally culpable like human driver scenario facetious couldnt tell full disclosure heavily biased towards selfdriving car think people bring trolley problem argue selfdriving car unnecessarily contrarian especially benefit massively outweigh potential downside talk car rare collision event completely ignore billion avoidable death caused letting human remain charge
someone never accident never near miss shallow thinking topic derek shouldnt extrapolated driver thats presumptuous isnt trolley problem endless number split second decision head towards old lady school child impact kill occupant lying infrequency event self delusion forget driver people like programmer already engaged question like entirely wrong way justify driverless car road there question creator unit assessment exist reckoned
funny often seem quick limit estimation skill intelligence others based try demand evidence believe thing like trouble whatsoever believing youd fast recognising difference cow old lady child bike know ive make similar assessment fraction second thankfully none involving injury anyone would think driver could instinctive reacting even speed wouldnt think ai programmer autonomous vehicle might make choice assumption scary one
tttm see trolley problem recognizing differentiating objectsbeings whoever isnt familiar pondering morally one kill one spare case killing somethingsomeone one option agree fact programmer huge responsibility programming point however driver figured yet maybe figured autonomous car shouldnt parameter getting street
waymos year talk drive outside mapped area
yeah omission key fact make whole video suspect corporate propaganda
whole video waymo advertisement
yeah application car stay within city oh except cab mass transit courier deliveriesyou know half car road
ricobarth comment got deleted guess application pointing huge resortments tech work emobility far le restriction driving range also system waymo us trapped map currently provider system dont need cage saying would good hear concern video since comment got deleted guess unwanted critisicm
waymo could year ago much ahead tesla theyve done one curious thing think trapped theyve never waivered entirely dependent lidar lidar quite hideous pod sticking car could never sell car public taxi use even though lidar could dirt cheap dont seem done anything avoid current extreme pricing lidar theyve saddled stone around neck nice mixed metaphor year seem done nothing better situation quite strange
driver might actually better average driver awful thinking driver relatively calm unspectacular always speed overtake dangereous situation show aggressive behaviour think might true friend neighbor totaled car year maybe crash caused driver
autonomous car stupid car stupid train already exist im sure theyd take automation wonderfully need working getting car road infrastructure blame frequency traffic death never fully autonomous vehicle sorry dark ideology present video
rip uber driversthey coming job
typical brazilian attitude
driverless car solution lot problem could also solved boring ol public transportation train arent flashy
think need careful selecting sponsored product push subscriber science channel mean moral obligation present technology dramatic societal impact absolutely unbiased manner impossible given video sponsored id much prefer video getting nitty gritty tech focus competition delving deeper real issue currently etc would appealing video im sure would pay dividend financially morally
yeah didnt mention downside waymo lack scalability due fundamental self driving software would also argue tesla mostly made lidar unnecessary get fairly accurate depth calculation mono lense camera well trained ai car actually better lot scenario radar removed solved whats point lidar need millimeter accuracy couple inch accuracy camera enough
something year away tesla
happens certain sensor fail get damaged lidar scanner corner look fragile
everyone driverless car would money coming ticket stop le work road police officer
derek heartfelt long comment feel science communication channel promotes use scientific method principle problem solution exist problem high number fatality exists manual driving personal vehicle one solution autonomous vehicle yes right example city planning implement better public transportation city lead walkable city fact video sponsored waymo feel like min painting good picture autonomous carsi totally agree said machine better driver human loss human life totally sad totally love content imagine might intent want ask question autonomous car comfortable didnt see one negative comment whole topic video wasnt specific portion sponsred feel way hope read love work
think great video doesnt touch important issue currently security would love video discus
try best best parent kid youll never know others parent kid school kid going learn kid
cant wait benefit driverless car generally agree video im concerned much glorify technological fix transportation problem easier solution mass transit safe cheap convenient accessible carcentric city design policy u dreaming star warsinspired intersection offer half throughput subway
maybe solution country road infrastructure good country like southeast asia ai get headache try cross red light
eager see autonomous driving gave driving several year ago take pain killer back injury asked doctor many pill could take still ok drive answer depends feel way indefinite answer liking many people feel ok drive many drink stopped driving together injured back car driving hit behind garbage truck stopped red light granted light changed stopped somehow doubt one autonomous driving system driving truck wouldnt kept greater distance u slowed saw yellow light think effective pr campaign seeking approval expand new jurisdiction would identify people killed accident jurisdiction would occured autonomous car many accident caused drunk distracted speeding driver sorry couldnt think appropriate word complete alliteration commercial cycled photo people wouldnt died could powerful impactful
though moral dilemma far car still need programmed mind right
ydk cc
wow good videocan talk tesla fsd video
im sure insurance lobby strong implemented large scale
insurance human driver go roof
option hike rate human driver collect easy money mandatory insurance safe car never demand payout insurance love auto
yo brings arizona hopefully wasnt july
issue liability who liable accident selfdriving vehicle get insured would curious know
elevator driver mean hard push button get want scary people back
issue driverless car would issue possibly required future youre allowed driver anymore
use train
would never trust life driverless car
driverless elevator minute get used
ok cool still want drive car cuz allot people includding want drive cuz nice
relevant question shouldnt wanted pilotless aircraft year ago understand hasnt happened might reasonable understanding future autonomous car
system consistently reliable tech last year dramatic performance gain much feasible ever autonomous plane mean flying car could gain actual traction
yay plane take fly land without need pilot would fly plane without pilot
tesla still better tho
bet serious accident autonomous vehicle vehicle fault driving car statistic show driverless car lower accident rate yet medium run one make decision put year kind suck hope come sooner cause people drive influence took test thats sure
waymo traveled million mile thats x le mile traveled california count many disengagement report filed period throwing big number car road autonomous would certainly work place otherwise take traffic cone wrong place throw exception
soon heard lady talking absolutely knew brazilian last name appeared bingo cavalcante brazilian good sister well represented
word much energy consumed car heavy electronics climate change thats kind question make think autonomous car become norm dont want climate change kill people car accident climate change pollution thing would gladly welcome technology stand horrible idea feel
wonder responds large mirrorlike surface
information well informed critic autonomous vehicle one opinion someone work company sponsored video feel like ad like car company advertises top reward initial quality mean derek look like sell liked early stuff
think better future car hable talk plot world domination mean route also add big brother street improve safety orchestrating car
real issue driverless car culpability system standard place assigning fault human driver cause accident responsible driverless car accident may almost never happen happenand insurance company law enforcement need able assign guilt owner people wont buy programmer good luck finding someone want job manufacturer might enough put company business law around assigning fault lack going keep driverless car road
really interesting topic im disappointed nearly nuance left order make optimistic advertisement especially science channel
selfdriving vehicle react poor condition adapt slick rainy road enough programmed simulation react variability tire slipping rainy road
honestly really hope happens soon
world white house urging facebook deplatform user silicon valley curled orwellian furball sure trust google car play nice used malicious actor fulfill ulterior motif sure thing like nobody company could ever mess one particular vehicle way spell freak accident flat crime sure thing ill take risk car
data many time human intervened prevent accident indicates technology ready would literally dozen hundred time many accident put autonomous car road right rare miss video
think theyre trying point car would prevent many accident accident inevitably happen fewer farther yes human intervention prevent certain accident car prevent accident human error would normally take place
supermustache isnt data show opposite right many year driverless car safer
joejoelqbd thats super interesting thats danger sponsored video like cant get genuine unbiased data analysis he trying push agenda selfdriving car company data point creates serious moral complication educational channel like one could link data id super curious research
ya exciting let hand control life tech company surveillance government im really sick rosey outlook everyone keep predicting
people start sort chasing car street test theyre gon na react like trying force onto sidewalk something dont know see people stuff like
didnt made exact argument another video year ago
lidar spin million revolution per second dont think vehicle waymo experience lol
probably misunderstanding spec suspect adc high end lidar would sample sensor order megasamplessecond still rotate relatively small rpm
shameless promo video word competition nothing problem system cost shameless promo video dead horse

wait
use train someone actual brain
many train stop outside house disabled think anyone walk train station live far station answer taxi like recall arent mimicking human driving performance trying exceed human capability improve safety
im u suburb seem already inefficient train cant really implemented public transport would efficient scenario also muricans resolve never use public transport dont help least self driving car increase safety
train go rail tunnel roof fall get killed train someone paranoid dumb
nonconsensualopinion thats need think way city inclusive disabled people city lived life paulo brazil third world country mind every bus adapted receive disabled passagers stop point outside normal subway line elevator staff trained guide disabled blind passagers paulo gold standard hell urban planning hellish joke across country even situation find way include disabled urban planning besides buy expensive car putting even car city already capacity
dont think youve ever lived small city
ultimate question event vehicle get accident fatal fault malfunction car liable damage owner car manufacturer programmer real important question liability time something go wrong sad question addressed
important potential life could saved legal edge case important making car accident legal edge case besides would almost entirely decided actual condition even cant give single definitive answer vary case case
would even better technology many mass transit option meaning le need individual car right
commute work dont want go work need wfh permanent
could back trailer
thats relatively simple task compared already demand trailer likely low youd call autonomous truck
dont understand need
wait minute thats brazilian accent
like driving im gona miss allowed
glad vacuum cleaner tech well haha shit seeing random movement others
driverless car need perfect g network work flawless big computer inside work much extra electricity infrastructure needed good environnement one one asking exepts big as tech company last thing least talk bad side seem natural sponsored subject
remember kid say gagetbauns
cant wait ive hungry full autonomy decade
comparison airplane ludicrous fog doesnt mean anything plane since landing based il complexity driving order magnitude higher
someone work industry need point something big barrier mass adoption level selfdriving vehicle sensor cost waymo us brand lidar called laser bear dont know cost sensor comparable sensor velodyne ibeo sick cost per unit make prohibitively expensive mass adoption current push industry seems handle task camera radar ultrasonics may take awhile reach true level autonomous
price drop massively produced much larger quantity
guess depends want compare cost taxi driver salary one cost doesnt really matter much even sure owning car still make sense many people future self driving car thing
dasprid probably also long road lidar arent perfect either think end road going fusion based solution rely multiple sensor think lidar part lidar currently developed supplier mature enough yet level even level oems rely radar andor camera adaptive cruise function currently blind spot monitoring almost completely radar based im describing ada side thing ada really leadin fully autonomous vehicle point going least year see consumer adoption level even going start city highend market coming expect delay
devluz yeah think commercial adoption first going take time true level
know horse drive maybe get back nature city life get head
light percussive music
think technology great save lot life mention ecofriendly far le car need built said love driving miss longer every day
trust autonumous better said unsupervised car highway anywhere else likewise plane know thats equivalent autopilot comercial plane ever wonder arent yet autonomus fighter jet yeah know developing right thing ready
reason think personally expecting tech available least another year exactly spoke end major city next year dont consider fully automated taxi service available interpretation go car dealership suburbanrural area purchase new automated vehicle drive away far nobody prediction individual car
waymo deal construction site dont put proper sign problem tucson arizona pile dirt middle road sign there light around dark
yeah dont think technology really problem external reality resides mean well let break firstly car arent well suited individual consumer ownership much theyre suited taxi perhaps light bus van obviously car ownership still pay car insurance maintenance fee gas combined probably people realize still give option use car see fit repair car make comfortable suited need car would likely work mile mile per ride basis matter cheap get probably never going cheaper mile mile cost owning car company right mind going want make large amount profit recoup initial investment improve technology may may depending whether get actual competition itll probably safer youre looking something thats cheap possible modern context people looking unless operate loss little profit youre going rough time second caveat think dont really excel context car inherently excel product form factor le developed rural area urban area generally smaller distance meaning walking cycling public transport perfectly adequate going one urban area next fine there possibility train plane long bus ride car inherently better suited place much le densely populated worse road maintenance offroading context ai driver isnt really needed going hard time better human driver extent already ai driver u time form traction control antilock braking system cruise control usually get disabled highest level offroad driving obviously technology stated could used automatic version technology wellsuited urban use normal car doesnt really make whole lot sense except rich people private selfdriving limousine knowing google similarly futurist project probably
found solution commuting problem thanks covid commuting
exactly
disappointed derek stayed shallow review saying ready autonomy look darpa challenge year vehicle able navigate autonomously
error impossible machine make yet see machine drive directly stationary object video several step usual quality cant help think sponsorship blame read like one long advertisement
""
dont want car road ever driverless otherwise carcentric development unsustainable long run city future must rely primarily pedestrian bike public transit infrastructure far efficient personal vehicle
hazel like didnt even read comment talking
say car shooting lazer beam thats gon na cause cancer
would prefer make public transport build technology world road efficiently filled car sound like antipedestrian hell scape full disclosure person like fact urban centre designed primarily accommodate car find hellish reality one profoundly antisemitic henry ford thank
antisemitism play haha still though dont forget ruthless antiunion man overinfluenced design world patenting someone el invention
imma add one comment totally car especially ev autonomous vehicle much em wish werent priority car accessible rent first place quite waste space think much asphalt constantly putting accommodate car think car pretty poor ratio much space take many people actually transport
sf baseball game took uber wasnt human driver forcing way line car id still sitting traffic sometimes need drive little aggressively said look forward seeing driverless car become norm
feel like important point addressed video responsibility car level self driving legally responsible car action someone today kill another crash clear party involved legal implication also criminal implication properly answered dont understand permitted road
imagine road ragers pulling car seeing driver
lol
put cut chuck norris seat

rapinsanramesh dont watch anymore created pfp year ago
care advanced autonomous driving get ill drive prius smile ever step foot death box control preform ice snow accurately safely prevent full rear end collision ice turned scratched bumper robot unpredictable road condition
could build city car optional
think technology awesome really look like potential save lot life one thing id like see manufacture engineering larger autonomous vehicle intended public use consider best way avoid worst case climate change scenario think bold considering best limit emission think would amazing could find way incentivize company focus effort autonomous van bus sold local municipality suburb public use understand profit motivation strong perhaps system like could work way similar one uk nh make worthwhile medical supplier continue make product manufacturer make good enough product meet high enough guideline standard even profit margin small per unit would still immense number unit moved im spitballing id love hear folk better read spent time thinking seems worthwhile consider best way optimize transit area climate change mitigation
best video editing ive seen veritasium
""
maybe waymo paid
people living general car official totally autonomous still work company also taxi driver get ubi yet needing driver get u lot unemployment
asiana accident automation incorrectly setup thats pilot took
exactly human fault incorrectly setting automation
max accident automation set override human input
dia also human error boeings executive decision disclose info pilot properly train use
may bc im europe think want car constantly driving avoid waste car parked yikes planet pls take public transportation ratio driver passenger tends make almost self driving lol
dont ever use cell phone well riding crash like commercial jet
autonomy amazing one day able put pair glass see car driving see virtual service member company
plz part making pro lady answer question question would kind defense got like get stolen guy broke window smashed car hamer would car reaction love ur vid keep hard good work
bigger picture whats achievable helping blinddisable people economical concern nice gold lie elsewhere able get wasted drive either taxi public transportwalk
love driving freedom feel get first one something never feel dont want full automation collision detection system thing detect asleep car
parome look moment buy car feel like part way year every car road practically ant control except emergency car well lose nuisance old human driver car
would car react police car trying stop entirely
replaced driver autonomous vehicle random blackout unusual sun activity turn gps satellite minute
worried irrational fear mass even make safer average human due power statistic great number accident kill perfectly innocent child maybe software error sensor error happen could argue till tomorrow actually saved child human driver place would killed public rally ant forbidden seen nuclear energy statistically safe considered dangerous mass population
safety aspect doesnt bother right ownership im concerned look like yet another way rich exploit everyone else manually driven car inevitably outlawed well getting charged go anywhere even moreso already capitalism taught u anything lack competition keep price going especially something necessary first world existence automobile travel
ever work zone would want autonomous car
voted year poll mentioned start video still agree everything said car safer human especially governmental regulation take long time seemingly obvious carnegie mellon car drove mile autonomously mentioned google self driving car around working well since easily think still caution new technology widespread adoption dont see u eu government approving level vehicle next year vehicle get approved likely one like waymos prohibitively expensive guess im hopeful excited ready take much longer
driver think average driver sure chuckle useful selfreporting significant percentage people lot dunningkruger effect little objectivity generally wrong suppose gave people test sort asked selfreporting question could factor whose likely wrong selfreporting factoid like wind useful joke human error cause accident even mean there road north cabo san lucas todos santos united state would many fatal accident shoulder huge drop offs go road youll likely die shrine dead everywhere road u veer paved road youll hear gravel mutter uhoh even remember happening went road turned cause death sure listed human error error road killed people vehicle todos santo road waymo vehicle lidar radar camera youre going hit go anywhere outside small part phoenix arizona vehicle compact car cost require room full tech watching computer yeah waymo car sure amazing ive rented car scotland japan driven road id never seen love traffic roundabout fine even missed hitting first fox also second ever dart front car im driving made bonehead mistake wasnt road todos santos survived also know tesla model ive driving past month well one thing exceptionally well stay road lane todos santos problem waymo flagstaff tucson mexico may well mar tesla get accident serious traffic accident ive anyway fault avoidable tesla safety feature keep dying even go edge road todos santos model went cliff couple week ago everyone survived meta analysis video polite way saying deep commercial waymo lot information distilled party like averaging average trolley problem really cheery statement im almost certain ill win discussion tesla fsd becomes either universally used system selfdriving basis waymo might useful limited situation perhaps limited geofenced area zero error tolerated moving nuclear waste transferring explosive mining site luggage train airport tarmac mark b report state autonomous driving dont include tesla unless snarky bit misbehaving tesla driver new york time past two month ran two one quoted source saying autonomous driving isnt likely happen year dont include flat earthers story space waymo interesting embarrassing fluff piece
driving arizona one thing deal snow flooding etc saying done still long way go five year still optimistic
lidar ontop frigging awesome
trust computer thats paying attention human isnt
one signed away liability injury cause everyone else hasnt
note case self driving car shown perfect weather well maintained metropolitan area bit suspicious miraculous claim replace human driver generally image would perform gravel road
real way combat traffic public transportation selfdriving car graphic would hellish landscape indeed human tread requiring crazy infrastructure account could use mass transportation already already safer individual car
true boggles mind railway barely used u
talking course public transport important efficiency example terribly awkward clip display highwayleveldensity interchange understand human dont tread hightraffic area today going decade yeah dont need able walk every square metre city good infrastructure safe
disabled elderly get bus stop train station show best public infrastructure planet improve factor ten ill show city still need autonomous car way autonomous car part public transportation think taxi gon na grandma carry grocery blizzard condition mile house bus station need taxi itd nice safer human driver itd nice wanted private ride driver itd nice blind could private car come door instead walking train station
solution traffic work home decentralised city cbd choke point
suck cant honest conversation autonomous vehicle without advertisement airplane land autopilot controlled environment multiple set radio tower precise flightpaths comparing car infrastructure meaningless
maybe soon road sign qr code
insurance charged choosing drive car requires input riding driverless car count towards good driving record
technology year two away close perfection improvement would almost redundant main thing slowing technology human habit fear new thing
nobody seems get loss freedom independence moving driverless car there nobody getting car drive wherever want accept tech company government taking care lose control denied restricted acces traveling like china wake people control think many car driven kind people kind state mind many mile amount death really small stop letting others come u basic action
fuel usage bet could lowered personally know corner coming turn gas pay momentum one direction soon go another
true business model isnt vaiable right technology way expensive thats still say year line
cant wait driverless car reduce number road death reduce travel time able drive faster also safer giving u time live life instead getting one dislike l like drive gone another advantage l heard use get around using set uber mode earn extra money working sleeping would cool
think one day banned drive road must rely company continued software support get one place another mercy corporate overlord
work properly fine computer bug
good waymo edge case
want driver driverless car completely retarded psychopath ill keep steering wheel though

car work low visibility situation snow covered road
reason driverless car always driving around sunny u state wide road wonder would fare european town city street checkerboardy u
jury result pitiful historic town center last bastion human driver guarantee

fine
yeesoest car banned historic town centre already many
carlosfreitas think itll snowy place automate last experience least thats environment distinction road road often muddied
modern aircraft autopilot disengage severe weather condition cause accident high risk automaton yet let alone even common edge case autonomous vehicle unpredictable human must navigate
surprising part human error rate accident whats mechanical failure probably also traced back human error often one looking forward robot overlord taking driver seat
mechanical failure animal environmental circumstance big group
biggest concern never safety car liability dont want liable something isnt fault producer car confident enough vehicle keep liability wouldnt mind self driving car
think aircraft still pilot autopilot capable flying plane decade manufacturer wont accept liability
utopia end video give year instead feeling im generous
didnt say theyd utopia year said theyd rolling big city five year
aidandavick ok still

love idea autonomous car really enjoy driving safety others worth
gut tell built neural net tech power netflixs horse crap recommendation system
average like half people make average income
except one person unlikely x better median driver whereas one person skew income average earning
cant wait illegal drive human worst driver
im looking forward self driving car theyre great safer time love driving would like ability switch manual control self control
good bye million job
also know difference engineerscientist science fan fan buy smart house tesla everything else controlled smartphone scientist last bought tech printer still loaded gun case emergency course joke people work computer general ai particular know danger

omg im even one car im terrified lol imagine policing change autonomous car ticket duis car chase fine kind amount life money saved astronomical
insurance company go broke
brianlhughes copsll go broke without speed trap traffic fine
police start real work
andrewsmithcdzf perish thought
many people live life deceived
driverless car better people driving properly statistically better avoiding collision well experience many people sceptical technology primarily due tesla way promote advanced lane keep assistradar cruise system full self driving misleading already proven significant flaw seen footage shown beginning tesla drove rolled vehicle without driver even trying prevent
wouldnt expect see fatality million mile u fatality rate per million mile need see many mile driving statistic talk fatality rate
ill consider vehicle fully autonomous safely take rockies cm hour snowstorm black ice snow slush thats half wheel deep sliding sideways cambered bridge foot valley floor one lane way foot cliff one side prime driving condition chasing storm winter
minute single word dramatic ecological impact would there already solution people dont want drive called public transportation instead mingling pleb upper class rather build fleet individual overly equipped dystopian metal bubble mining co emission implies even start get early taste violently climate change going hit u tech capitalist wont question delusion
cant wait driverless car arrive reduce road death react quicker wiser u human able drive faster reducing hour wasted time getting place giving u time live life dislike driverless car l like drive car miss one advantage l heard owning driverless car use get around using set uber mode earn extra money would cool

decommodification mean production important especially product inelastic demand transportation education utility healthcare etc important fight going forward one really ready
imagine eventually system car connected network communicate example instead putting indicator show want change lane carsdrivers visually notice could ping car area instantly know hell could even connect phone gps network give better idea pedestrian doubt would failsafes say car loses connection network nearby car could alerted overly cautious car etc
tech u street layout mostly extremely bad human simple ai perfect weather condition stand even theoretically optimistically cover population know paid advertizement mentioning light fog tighter street complex intersection like european inner city completely wreck car statistic would honest thing
pov playing game like watch dog autonomous vehicle pov oo hope car future wont easily used assassination attempt xd
im opinion problem accident data presented many accident caused autonomous car performing expected behavior driver cultural regional social norm driving simply bunch mathphysics problem waymo autonomous vehicle example stop instead driving two wheel shoulder area causing accident car around directly impacted counted sure another edge case design quality road infrastructure ever nonphoenix city north america
dont get people think driverless car mean noone car wont need car park etc yall keep stuff boottrunk
hi think driverless car get market share hire cab aslso remain niche everybody tight run schedule know wtith precision want go drive next annoying know ordered car waiting changed mind said normal car sits time mean efficient doesnt consume energy drive next job empty depreciating go slow night hour need drive garage back forth cleaned serviced dont want end occupying new green area intended people rush hour lunch hour etc still exist fit finite amount stuff finite amount road space really success transportation cheaper imagine going mall restaurant everybody ill congest road desired area think solve problem beside special case mentioned also rest create problem solve
future
thing im worried hacker telling car drive bridge suddenly demolition derby lick problem im sold
propaganda smh
happens lidar affected another vehicle also outputting lidar would significant issue
many bad driver road today
technology pick really test vehicle country like india etc famous worst driver world
perhaps underrepresented opinion id rather investment public transportation like train bus system creation infrastructure city design boost walkability whereas need car although situation choose one honestly find tech selfdriving car admirable amazing think solution selfdriving car answer problem inherently created horrendously designed u u inspired road infrastructure id hardly say replacing million even portion amount persondriven car selfdriving car elegant even ideal situation fixing traffic doesnt address problem facing near future like resource waste pollution neither think feasible solution affordability costofliving perspective thinking average average earning family normal car already cost lot money need gas break easily need replacement part well require insurance imagine extra cost replacement part selfdriving car sure may say infrastructure cost lot money good public transportation also potential allow future return economy lower class individual would access cheap transportation option higher playing job living close paying transportation would unaffordable discussion kinda spiral topic plague suburban sprawl u well thought driverless car cool tho
selfdriving bus happen sure giving area access public transportation nighttime smaller car bus day larger think used case big forest fire etc people need evacuated
yeah agree conclusion autonomous car safer humandriven one least relatively near future absurdly high number traffic death one several huge problem caused overreliance car u also would rather see u move away individually owned automobile toward accessible efficient public transportation could also automated suppose
rhapsody blue agree bus electric selfdriving otherwise future mass transit u strive mass transit america demonstrated well system work many european nation think bus system interconnected train system maybe also electric selfdriving would optimal feel longer commute likely use car get city comparing human body major artery vein would rail system take close want bus system would capillary transport destination accurately admit would challenging transition anything resembling modern european transit system america population density comparison extremely low due u city zoned doesnt lend well system service large amount people equally large low density area
mikaelohman make good point didnt think selfdriving bus although would thrilled endorsement kind well designed bus system personally believe technology rely everyone selfdriving car road safer dont believe meaningfully fix root issue overall idea would transit system would take lot pressure road system everyone would need drive would turn make road safer le congested addressing issue make valid point forest fire live area prone
lockeyschmidt mix selfdriving car bus etc major part like today cost need car compared use transit system someone want drive fun road allow sure still use horse come truck another point caravan truck pretty soon mean one people follow mode bunch one way people place handle technical issue etc time drive longer distance without risk falling asleep driving speaking truck maybe mixed unit like truck pick people along way well maybe delivery service put free space rent going point b avoid sending halfloaded truck around country lot new idea popping along ride tech get better used pitfall well sure example show much data car track car well hacker thats

wouldnt autonomous vehicle make traffic worse since everybody would willing spend much time vehicle even every vehicle automized lol everybody would still need use vehicle time rush hour im sure wouldnt net reduction vehicle road parking lot like cheaper cost per ride would mean people kid elderly disabled would able get around without needing pay thousand basic mobility
derek better sorry comparing airplane car sure mate variable mean problem moral subjective think people answering question presented really easy answer whats question yet questioned problem adressed think better commercial still watching video will engineer think overseeing people behind autonomous car biased
expecting end cargo ship middle ocean
one great video derek problem differenciating soft plastic bag heavy object way autonomous vision ready btw wish car already automated
think certainly future driving elevator perfect example think next step need addressing together performance autonomous driving development infrastructure support autonomous driving well believe driving one day getting inside train elevator exciting think might happen sooner think
im much favour driverless car reason ultimately safer majority vehicle driverless said fairly nave comment tech place video ask ever app phone computer lock apparent reason well happens moving car obviously software carefully designed extensively qualified similar aerospace software simulated point government agency step set testable bar manufacturer meet think work vision based system though lidar im also curious potential active system lidar several car interfering
sorry havent figured yet make spellchecker work aint ready driverless car
dear self driving software engineer u code stuff metric please product roll world wan na know imperial car one wasting computer power conversion thanks human
nice use insta camera
dont tell think
many u computer crash using update interrupt work lose internet connection essential sensor fails autonomous car may drive better human introduce whole slew issue yet solve sure year accident isnt bad many car also automatic elevator limited thing go wrong environment well controlled airplane also fly land environment highly controlled air traffic controller make sure plan arent crossing flight path air isnt full plane anything could hit something without actively trying runway kept clear many obstacle using variety method autonomous car dont control environment problem think solve
want driverless car sponsored driverless car company lose trust
course want driverless car also want r daneel olivaw hook neither
breaking news getting paid saying something completely invalidates opinion scientist get paid study mean theyre always biased anybody supposed make living
raulfull tobacco good eating sugar doesnt make fat eating fat make fat man made global warming alcohol good cannabis make violent rapist nice work get
popeii im saying blindly follow say still made pretty solid point regardless sponsorship
good expensive car camera laser lider like know ferraries good quite afford also even car autonomous motorcycle safe road like said video dont need near autonomous vehicle
want
could play police siren loud speaker trick vehicle pulling say driving next
government control daily life integrated automated driving system wouldnt really control vehicle would automated someone pissed government would take access away dont agree idea think car still completely autonomous like current vehicle need keep
got ta love dig tesla
love
seem noisy cant imagine hundred street making noise
pacifica like one doesnt self driving tech super high tech love driving
edit selfie stick
take long respond doesnt slow approach clearly person sized objet moving slowly towards path driving person suddenly stopped like youd think theyre idiot people skeptical self driving car make basic mistake situation like hard computer deal
data doesnt support assertion human better computer stuff
going incredibly slow point poor braking mechanism paired fact software incredibly risk averse
take long slowed every time someone walking footpath next youd get nowhere also someone might turn walk front sort thing requires intelligence car moment showed le hour driving presumably really arent ready primetime yet
already moving pretty slow ive seen lot people similar many worse suppose predictive calculation suddenly put lot weight likelihood pedestrian crossing already close due corner hard breaking required meet safety standard set
brendonwood arent ready primetime yet even though serious accident caused computer million mile driving
yeah mean cool technology probably would use long run sure would good basically would make driving easier convenient maybe cheaper would make attractive people would drive one example rent expensive people live suburb get urban sprawl commute far get self driving car sleep car getting two hour commute longer problem live even drive even assuming get super efficient zero emission vehicle isnt given youre still spending energy experience shown u make engine twice efficient people immediately drive twice much kind behavior absorb efficiency gain tool really solution first objective reduce total need transportation idea like developing telecommuting telepresence general optimizing delivery developing optimized logistics reshaping housing urbanization come transportation policy promote active transportation like biking there argument biking isnt energy efficient ive never noticed cyckists noticeably larger eater course health benefit would huge value reshape city could practical mean transportation everyday life idea
buy autonomous car
many horrible driver road make completely novel manoeuvre dangerous infinite human stupidity could come possibly outside training data car id rather drive car time would much rather however average driver shift self driving car soon humanly possible remember everyone hold computer gold standard better expertsthe best human matter theyre better average god passed level year ago
im favor autonomous vehicle hope choose emphasize form mass transit future
exactly didnt mention
could potentially introduce selective personalised mass transport best bus train taxi aggregation desired route efficiently worked eventual efficiency junction traffic flow mentioned end hell yeh also might green generally afford fare whole vehicle public ownership help ensure essentially customised bus route based many user input could computed andfurther tech modularised bustrain magnetically link afaik thats reason look cool head maybe though increase speed via force linking vehicle single route increasing speed avoid collision train part journey knowswell seems like way ahead anything video leave weird idea probably got forgotten scifi saw
going really really really hard sale average american american landscape car order magnitude convenient faster american arent used waiting ride arent used limited carry
urban city mass transit already case suburban area space see intermediate solution
thinkscotty might convenient live suburb afford nice car anyone commute work boston washington know take hour go mile car normal day bus arent much better thats use road well second someone decides cut someone highway text drive could cut several lane traffic expanded light heavy rail would serve suburb city far better self driving high speed rail would help intercity travel self driving latest ploy car company reduce spending public transit
id really love see train extremely rare odd case car might encounter programmer understand reasonable level ai computing id love know take account hope never happens example someone purposely assaulted car sensor moving busy street gas tanker fell different parallel road gas travelled across current road set fire im sure go inspection work day predicts damage self throughout day self check ride safety operating system ensuring everything work case hardware short ride would imagine kind rare case system handle would help resolve hesitation everyone could handle situation without heavy experience
waymo sound car hitting
technology extraordinary astonishing however least good condition technology functional thats good enough comparison plane landing fog surely requires show car drive fog heavy rain happens poor condition jj ride video waymo light rain past year safety driver car fact still steering wheel show waymo limited confidence technology read comment video find resident frustrated car getting stuck matter public acceptance better five year mention robotaxi trial china waymo get glory uncritical shill expected better guess rollout limited domain first waymo whole phoenix two year amazed
functional good condition good enough ton use case maybe somebody who ice road trucking large part la phoenix major city would perfectly adequate least adequate human driver large margin really margin better fact still steering wheel show waymo limited confidence technology something could easily bash opposite oh steering wheel stupid need take control car largely matter public acceptance yes everyone want ensure perfect solution advancing technology even slightest amount blood hand would make national headline paint company red long time truth car never going come find reason entire comment section people dont like change
fddesathere already thousand car self driving freeway highway opposition lack acceptance also doesnt accepted everyone people accepted driverless train even good condition still problem edgecorner case watch video jj ride last year vehicle get confused safety cone first doesnt pull road stop block road least tesla admitting problem edge case cant find anything waymo maybe wasnt obvious would good see video extent success problem chinese trial cruise origin video building first planned robotaxis without steering wheel testing well see sooner rather later billion invested far people going want something back money autonomous shuttle limited mph already use transport around factory first revenue service beginning
every trip make car reinforces fact everyone use fully autonomous vehicle would save thousand million life every year oh missed one reason accident happen missed huge number accident due people simply dont care safety others therefore intentionally incredibly dangerous thing like running red light save second travel time see kind thing nearly every trip take
dont hate driverless car transportation dominated type transportation would effect car industry driver needed car would expect pay higher premium would driver vehicle ban point im giving driver required car service based transportation transportation general dominated form transportation would see elevated pricing white collar want make stock holder happy
fine like controlling agency decides dont need go anywhere take pandemic example better way enforce stay home policy curfew government mandating autonomous vehicle network get suspended im autonomous vehicle large company providing service software think id ok privately owned autonomous vehicle revert manual control owner definitely giving control corporation government

elevator plane either isolated system integrated network car however interact automated car human driven car pedestrian dont trust driverless car rather dont trust human driver
driver average people atrociously bad driving drag rest assume people badness point driving guy badness point technically objection btw
nah bra want robust public transport system walkable city even cheap car cost thousand dollar year operate even fully paid
agree first part second part could arguably said exaggeration depending include running cost like fuel motor oil etc would cost le thousand assuming get mpg spend dollar full tank drive k mile per year like typical driver repair insurance would cost around depending vehicle health cost maintain car year comparable even le amount typical american person budget food annually monetary cost really main reason public transport better car inefficiency time sitting parking lot time carry passenger capacity polluting cost
jeromeorji appealing wallet quicker easier thing layman yet dont see average cost year public transportation tax pass v time owning car isnt good reason people car keep people poor keep ten million american poor enviromentally car mega trash understand critique cost considered distant rd environmental impact car yet wallet planet still norm
trade offs absolute safety
hope technology evolves resemble something like irobot manual control always option selfdriving whereas need casually get somewhere selfdrive want experience drive
imagine basically insurance car truck could drive deliver stuff life insurance cheaper le people dying car accident inimaginable implication
get ready culture war put gun debate shame personally im much side giving people option manually driving constitutionally protected something million truly enjoy big preemptive f insurance company make manually driving prohibitively expensive soon even slightly justify
derek like driving car
accessibility nice reducing accident obviously good even eliminate accident entirely still good good public transit bike infrastructure walkable community would electric wouldnt emit greenhouse gas theyll displace job create like automation capitalism
true get mix thing staff help big autobus example tesla going auto electric many people think going major part good public transit denmark driverless train like year bad system
cyclist never cause accident everyone know effing nazi ask
hopefully help u get closer endding usa anti pedestrian infrastructure

brendonwood kind legislation change
vitordacosta change buy house collapse killing someone person bought responsible person built one responsible
brendonwood mimimimimimi
public transport driverless car approved year year year
current semi driver start preparing transition electric vehicle mechanic soon
gon na come soon owning car like emotional attachment machine people stop buying car society still think car social status standard autonomous system adopted across car manufacturer would successful waymo alone flood car street expect car owner dump car
pushing autonomous car purpose gathering information camera buy one fool
weekly coasttocoast traffic fatality like crashing every week owned tesla year im believer technology hoping kid avoid need get key dad talk come time vehicle networked aware others proximity intended movement need figure feed people arent dying
correct people problem trust techkindado mistrust driversdefinitely
almost car autonomous believe auto accident almost extinct
system get hacked pretty good target terrorist ask
one day manual driving would considered illegal
tell kid
one part cant agree wasted time parking autonomous car desired personal ownership ongoing price must help company manage overhead cost order stay business quickly become unsustainable many people imagine wayco trip might cost uber wouldnt even surprised learn cost incredible kind technology exists could huge help safety everyone road paying maintain vehicle longterm making money back many trip wayco would essentially pay one autonomous car making fiscally irresponsible one
sorry literally waymo website weather condition like rain sleet snow reduce effectiveness onboard sensor fact weather condition may completely blind sensor making useless falling snow gather front lidar unit longer return data vehicle perception engine service currently operates phoenix almost always sunny skewed data based solely sunny day every day there also possibility fine tune map data navigation smaller scale compared real world data anyone ever used gps life time redirects wrong way tell get wrong lane worse still drive wrong way one way street youre talking autonomous driving definitely going future clear distinct bias towards sponsor think need focus fact sugar coat thing reason cant sunshine rainbow one talking tech could literally get people killed tech openly admit flaw need addressed viable solution long term flaw currently difficult beat technical level daresay
great job
im starting lose trust veritasium recent video make good point comment dont think derek could give full response
dont like video ad cringe
surprised see essentially promotion piece talking scenario good weather also course current statistic show human error frequent cause accident vehicle driven human driverless car road big city sort weather condition ratio change explore condition driverless car prone failure instead citing large number ai stats know ai suffers various kind training bias car adapted new local regulation frequently implemented city around add new stop lighting rule lane marking bicycle etc hard keep car upon stop sign twisted angle human recognize car level minimum adequate really disappointed lack balance dont object enthusiasm technology disservice lost trust channel
best ok driver never accident still dont want road much le people bring robos
mile average human driving experience year human right ai still need larger amount experience train level human however agree overall system fairly easily better conscious time see direction
looking forward safer road believe autonomous vehicle efficient meantime im wondering car trained programmed driving u cope driving elsewhere europe rule different differ one country another often car trained multiple lane round abouts narrow street left hand driving mean well standardise driving rule time tell
ever heard tarzen wonder car
literally hear cgp grey watching video right
need get road thank great video
feel like technooptimistic paid promotion discussion negative alternative
doesnt derek tesla
said video sponsored waymo answered question
talk detail accident record also talked challenging perception thing important negative alternative think missing discussion
ryanthompson didnt talk problem scaling reason waymo phoenix likely never viable global solution research autonomous car outside paid promotion youll see big debate
exactly like malcolm gladwell podcast episode weird
people arent good driving always hurry
another fun yt channel wrecked tech industry buying tragic
dont want driverless car safety reason one point lot safer regular car car culture reason car always culture hard imagine world without mk supra r skyline gtr car many people favourite favourite cuz drivable people fell love handling andor modding capability driverless car take away fun driving car make computer work taking away performance benefit car driver hell even year old see mazda mx na one favourite cute look almost unbelievable performance look like seriously track toy like car drive add mass car make driverless even mass placed slightly wrong balance make dream car freight train drive quite surprised didnt put like drive car option poll beginning video
time crash people something unexpected people unexpected thing time panic brake cause pedestrian cyclist crash thats exactly comforting either
prefer drive thank
definitely possible half participant mean driver score required bad driver sample bad generally true average participant participant participant participant average score driver average however ever find median driving probably one
sitting back sleeping commuting dont need autonomous vehicle public transportation good city planning already
driving instructor studying engineering future adopted europe lifespan american city old make suitable europe however many road current ai figure
well actually working remotely fixed lot issue like commute cheaper easier
yeah self driving car safer human driver buuuuuuuuuut autonomous car hacked thats something accepted problem avoided quantum computer internet ransomware today maybe future allow car imagine ransomware lock car pay example render car unable start whatever malicious thing personal data today private data exchanged lot entity commercial exchange mostly phone anything internet regulation depending live either well enforced dont give lot protection used state moral political motif public transport could job cyber criminalityterrorism thing personal car good idea actually bad one reason entirely different driving
cant hacked lol see reason cant data harvested go often place suggest go go connect phone go give perk app point arent valid
neferpitou way easier hack phone instead hacking car vigorous safety protocol
parome see point saying something unhackable isnt realistic im sure putting measure place protect kind stuff cant believe unhackable hard people dont kill im saying hacking kill company problem either need keep simulation server check someone put wrong value update computer facility sometimes go wrong also saying data collected doesnt matter silly response data collection hasnt started probably ill leave future im sure adopted quickly probably attack public transport heavily
parome well matter fact steal car without lockpicking hotwiring using software anymore car use electronic card might lot engineer working matter always weak point also private data heavily exploited doesnt mean cant fix future take political car would make process even harder
parome ok yeah im worrying wondering uber driver truck driver becomes normal lol
everybody gangsta car software throw exception middle route
think greatest danger car hacked could misused spy around constantly monitoring sourroundings essential part tech like many time nobody know happens collected information amazon google assistant turned spy user bought consciously car invade privacy almost everyone encounter without warning consent saying
unfortunate reality intersection like would incredibly hostile pedestrian nonvehicle commuter
wouldnt crosswalk button like exist already busy intersection make even safer pedestrian since wouldnt car attempting beat light
bridge solve problem
nah walk past street trust every car emergency breaking
build tunnelsoverpasses car bridge pedestrian dont need intersection allow car people
karttrak arent building already
want thing paying money tell want
dont think need money besides first time talk positively selfdriving car
made fsd video without including tesla comma ai anything else waymo
tesla isnt actually close waymos
dont quite agree driverless vehicle make transportation cheaper would suggest efficient economic impact large shift dont know particular price drop car company may go business volume sale drop significantly remaining company charging per vehicle example many trucker unemployed possibly creating strain economy individual retool retire potentially change cant predict though driverless impact economy environment another point mile experience doesnt seem like good measurement assume experience encompassing icy road rough road mountain etc much knowledge learned infinite driving situation continuous learning happen certain point enough experience much learning get need doesnt help
like dont trust selfdriving car dont trust driver
already self driving car theyre called taxi
welcome chandler
video wouldnt better wasnt commercial youd think big boy like derek afford objective research talk pro con competitor current state thing u rest world automating truck would interesting bit instead got something shouldve titled want waymo road right sponsored
ive got say dont like idea sharing street mindless drone whenoh wait
tesla waymo
thats obviously false
infinitelyexplosive obviously false tesla trying general fully self driving car able drive anywhere waymo testing fenced area mile driven simulation real world like tesla
medokn tesla trying something selfdriving car may superior future right
infinitelyexplosive go watch know tesla time news come back
thats possible india
lot cab driver looking career change
driving rain snow
feel like commercial issue many fully autonomous car remote driver monitoring limited area tech ready used every road every weather condition
biggest problem future driver losing job going hard future self driving car
add driver assist braking like mercedes well safe enough
opinion didnt research autolands enough include segment video system land plane benign atmospheric condition fine usually fairly calm foggy risk associated localiser beam deflection vehicle airplane major risk confronted suddenly handfly outoftrim goaround low visibility condition low ground autopilot implemented modern airliner far away autonomous something often misunderstood saying autonomy never happen complex problem
always kind annoys people bring finding half people think theyre better average driver always presented complete absurdity something clearly unambiguously demonstrates people terrible evaluating others would wholeheartedly agree conclusion statistic pretty meaningless make average driver good driver different people could different definition might mean drive safely driver others could mean able certain thing better like park small space handle vehicle well hazardous condition others could mean know rule maybe ignore others might mean know car work etc etc etc absolutely possible people saying theyre better average driver absolutely correct simply using different perfectly valid case definition mean good driver moral story people necessarily stupid terrible evaluating ability others people stupid terrible formulating question interpreting data correctly survey question useful must clear precise unambiguous otherwise theyre pretty meaningless
blame car kill pedestrian miss speed limit sign speed car judged court
relevant question hasnt answered anywhere yet current law manufacturer one reason wont happen anytime soon
car company
statistically mathematically speaking car road automated ground transportation would much safer real test car react human driver unpredictable
yes let put people work pay amazing time alive
think better way reduce car death reduce dependence car done public transit increasing safety cyclist pedestrian though better infrastructure reduce traffic death reduce traffic congestion pollution check channel bike better idea work
agree video comparison elevator driver make sense decision risk none statistic dictate deploy autonomous car asap human terrible driving however responsible error occurs hard problem also trusting computer trusting company program vehicle bad update example many time life seen product properly tested yet rushed prevent money loss company
traffic problem driverless car isnt simple one believe make follow video unsustainable nature current road design dont actually know driverless car would make better worse due induced demand reaction developer city planner new future
need ride walking house would epicly ultimate
ive seen automated car video year year still simply buy one dont see changing soon yeah seem work well perfectly maintained normal member public gon na let sensor get dirty example there big difference test drive everyday runaround
biggest question car interact trained drive human driven vehicle also train autonomous vehicle
search g network self driving car youll find lot different info subject g enabler car talk real time sharing visual audio etc
mikaelohman thanks ill check
driver elsewhere recall info coming specifically stating waymo used human drive behind scene
nope
emergency vehicle upcoming traffic
hacked car make crash purpose ever seen upgrade
always traveled driver called train take le arrive destination
good condition guess issue many time road traffic good condition computer handle every possiable problem situatlon come across yet convinced
mine think like mvp today cant dont think would problem year
well self driving car better traffic
raulfull probably right remember sponsored piece sure negative computer driven car mentioned example told u plane crash happen human error talk plane incident happened computer error
raulfull issue self driving car pedestrian bicyclist animal nonoptimal road etc especially outside metropolitan area highway
asher true nobody said computer perfect better human
nah thanks would like keep freedom please
imagine highway patrol officer arresting cpu failure show registration driver licence
love use metric system american british person really wan na thank
autonomous vehicle already exist population theyre called public transportation invest
autonomous system respond unusual situation let say emergency responder giving hand signal driver big puddle road human driver would drive around even meant going wrong way disregarding sign better avoid get stuck hole cant see
im cant get seeing youtube video waymo losing connection whatever fail condition park across two lane traffic call customer supportfor full minute
elon musk going catch
im driverless car soon isolated lane road
im reminded story heard ted talk american life something cop driving narrow city street corner eye saw storm door fly open didnt see person come slowed roll anyway short time later small child ran street two parked car slowed would hit kid decision would made computer billion calculation millisecond decision human made millisecond took foot react eye argument autonomous vehicle illustrate powerful mind nervous system love point dumb people dumb thing dumb people must never forget computer always make best decision based actuarial analysis never match human ability make right decision based real living world
error impossible machine make really computer never unexpected error video game never glitchy google youtubes algorithm perfect gps never led people drive river yes could claim also human error human error code still error machine make accident human error human programming machine eliminates human error doesnt make lot sense assume human train machine thing perfectly yet cant thing perfectly dont get wrong im automated car may even much safer impossible machine make mistake daresay even improbable used frequent video store year ago sign counter said err human truly screw take computer
tech dead end lidar distraction camera far better hd map scalable way tesla fsd real deal tesla removed even radar car actually drive better since btw tesla collect mile driving data every day
car camera lidar v vision there reason everyone using lidar autonomous driving going essential cant compare driver aid like fsd autonomous driving arent thing there world difference driver aid work time need human maintain responsibility autonomous car human intervention visual data without pointcloud train isnt particularly useful fact even worth storing dont also tesla fit lidar car use training
assuming soul exists using driverless car argument anyone come whatever place experience emotion watch movie life plane whenever choose
driverless soul earthhas nice ring
good news wont responsible anymore insurance go bankrupt lol
see youre able try tesla full self driving beta v derek currently designed vision radar function regardless road condition doesnt use premapped route also beneficial used ev doesnt bulkynoisy radar ev transition coming soon think waymo setup would reduce range dramatically ev interesting see thing advance coming year
tesla fsd joke point
well done another thought provoking entertaining video love veritasium
climate crisis caucacity
progress raging let automat everything people may finally leave life without risk severely twisted mindset real moral dilemna put another entire swath population work

small proportion landing autolandings require catiiib il equipment found major international airport theyre used low visibility condition pilot monitor system closely putting stress manual landing autolandings typically hard landing every pilot could perform smoother manually
entire thing feel like add thanks
would never trust life family completely machine software bug virus million factor could compromise safety passenger would pro driving assistance system completely independent
people driving automobilesactually video make cry cant wait rent car
believe ability autonomous car personally always get sceptical talk billion mile driven data quality mile equivalent including firefly probably didnt drive super well feel like quantitity data meant like oh lot must obviously ok like gigo garbage garbage
poor eyesight personally could yesterday appart form woman decapitated car accident near live last week husband driving live necessity luxury
question car wasnt future transportation even autonomous car simply take much space single person much efficient mode transportation think first
parome here thing spending billion mode transportation known efficient sign changing adapt climate change u spend much single road spend elsewhere make cycling walking nightmare making problem better doesnt solve problem
parome simple make people want change suburbia messed concept
there lot talk trusting technology bro ill trust technology soon trusted meaning car actually every test drive doesnt cause accident normal driver maybe even cause le accident trusted im stepping toaster crash second obviously technology way better irl mind
think way misleading people machine different weak point video address weak point people low visibility forgetfulness distraction short attention span contrast car may weak point overlooked like computer really good keeping track thing even better pedantic accountant yet good enough understand context sure weak point would car help notice video positive
driverless electric bus would even better
like video get sponsored company obvious interest one side debate problematic right also interviewing one person happens work company remotely give objective picture road safety expert driverless car researcher etc
tesla gross
honestly yeah never autonomous car dont trust human around car stupid think road level autonomous car affordable would norm driving car treated novelty cruiser like old vw bus ford model
cool technology
great driver everyone either always say there higher chance someone else make mistake many risk taking single drive without knowing driverless car take risk small fraction percentage could probabyl live year never accident one
make ton great point one cant wait gon na great imagine life thatll saved proxy thing road instead would normally susceptible distractable driver
driverless car solution accident solution traffic public transportation adam something great video build train
nothing happy tech indeed amazing prohibitively expensive cool
support autonomous vehicle driving autonomous vehicle get mean get data directly translates safer operation great way get data vehicle would deploy system driver uber service observing action behavior road unit good habit aggregated
think biggest issue selfdriving car going forward going winter freezing rain making certain patch road icy snow narrowing road snow ice build car hampering sensor visibility going major challenge
biggest issue going hack complete meltdown certain situation dont know anything solar flare extreme weather terrorist attack displacement million job self driving car inevitable point due political pressure going improve life stupidly rushed ruined like everything else
external condition matter training also likely similarly bad human driver potentially sensor specialised pick eg black ice ice car sensor potentially solvable adding heater preventing startup heater done job absolutely design challenge need considered area betterthanhuman performance likely
greenl car accident caused human incompetency something try fix quickly occupation forever change new one created old one longer needed even little bit backlash beginning job lost would rather die lose job go find new one said going improve life easy say life isnt one lost
major challenge human well fact id trust ai better handle patch black ice
human suck self driving car like tesla handle icy road really well
point could build better public transport
true better reliable environmentally friendly
yea please even say getting rid parking lot car stay stationary life well le car instead autonomous one
exactly tech super impressive also overly complicated solution problem solved way efficiently good public transport system
fine urban area u urban public transport even smaller city mean youre spending significant amount time commuting
agree statement think main issue building better public transport process cool politically charged autonomous car cool futuristic
keep pushing agenda
much would change many moral issue arise auto insurance company charging human driver auto insurance company disappearing traffic police traffic ticket revenue disappear payment hierarchy faster slower travel pay get faster class system car rich poor value life occupant traveler governmentprivate party control transportation people warrant transported jail control people allowed leave home use car sooo much
trtust thing million mile snowstorm night min degree celcius well icyrain storm
perhaps portion industry leader accumulated data shared newcomer competitor
due lidar far superior camai would trust life lidar without second thought yet trusting life camai system ex tesla something could never bring without hand gripped firmly steering wheel
""
yknow public transport overhead wire
getting rid parking lot making city greener solving traffic focus much car public transport also driver think average give generous take could say every single one right value different metric one person might think best maintain car limit grip corner might think best never put risky position another might different opinion safety think best predictable etc
autonomous driving handle weather condition hydroplaning jackknifing would autonomous drone air viable solution
one biggest hurdle cost purchase individual want vehicle ready time added cost sensor software etc put reach particular folk always buy used vehicle wont take untill buy used one k
good chunk probably due excessive profit margin local car dealership basically create exclusivity contract municipality meaning new car super overpriced could solve problem say online purchase tell new car pull customer driveway might solve issue deliver also there really reason think would efficient individual purchase would much efficient form taxi single car would able serve need multiple people per day rather sitting driveway life
im concerned safety aspect like freedom get vehicle go want want there computer involved going hal letting go want personal ownership transportation one greatest expression freedom ever taking away rely corporation state evil
sad sponsored video speak people wan na sell thing already believe cant know biased probably dont even know blindspot bias would nice would talked people well im saying false balance thing neutrality would picked scientist ki eg people field like traffic planner emergency staff etc speaking seller avoid primacy effect could avoided wouldnt bad video say people think better video like feel like im better informed cant determine well critically researched im basically watching long advertisement
wondering car would get refueled isnt anyone car refuel remembered work company trying inlane wireless charging ev literally charge driving hope tech widespread within five year would freaking sick
itll everyone trust self driving car definitely stay especially people disability
technology good thing gon na expensive

guess people used make living driving basically worm food
yes autonomous car safer human already sooner think however one common job planet doesnt require education driving universal basic income ubi better coincide ten million job loss lot needle pain suffering whilst fortunate get chauffeured around cheaper taxi

bet human drunk drivingsleepy driving computer crashing
frickin cyclist annoy much
ive lived chandlergilbert entire time waymo project going amazing well however one point following freeway seem modulate brake often make unpredictable human driving around anticipate going awhile start tune modulated brake light make le efficient reacting sudden stop sure could solved software maybe already done difficult anticipate modulating brake brake light like driver road
see near future anytime want go smalllarge distance ask car like ask uber price much lower driver would make owning car pretty much obsolete
expecting bet professor driverless car road
selfdriving car road safer car driven human still le safe car road
personally cant wait selfdriving car take interest need vehicle fact damn near nobody need vehicle selfdriving car become thing think vehicle time usually sitting nothing taking space burning money family least two car spend time sitting nothing selfdriving car take become reliable thing personal car ownership becomes relic past instead ten family needing twenty car ten family could easily served single vehicle instead spending energy producing literally hundred million vehicle environmental damage come could meet transportation need people maybe twentieth amount look forward probably need socialized paid tax though capitalism ruin everything eventually
honestly im kinda excited self driving car let realistic primary form transit car general whether electric petrol wasteful compared public transit like bus train think theyre great alternative community cant cant yet serviced good public transit system still main focus software developer also object selfdriving car unable make humanerror yes car human computer controlling human people designed car human people programmed cartrained neural network human inevitably humanness trickle system better human sure hope theyre going get chance prove right say factor consider
amount time loud said wow like im god damn owen wilson course watching wild eye opening already fan driver automation thing biggest thing million mile stat nut
security say war happens another country hack car cause harm population something also keep mind
real question autonomous car public transport system
cant wait cheap supersafe transport
course airplane elevator arent analogous level complexity encounter operating far le average car driving store back many variable road sky im excited autonomous car waymo operating well maintained road sunny dry weather road fully mapped ahead time thats scalable solution tesla think theyre going get vision dont see becoming reality another decade

like driving interest car first year ago autonomous car started become plausible reality disliked thought naturally dont want loose part life realized government choose regulate driving future hope people still allowed drive autonomous car make thing better mean many people road today driving get somewhere car interested actual driving experience people become good thing like talent become good thing dont like people doesnt really want drive autonomous car instead traffic would lot nicer u enjoy actual driving
yes sadly government love strip freedom excuse safety country banned driving would move another country criminal
awesome next year hella ambitious id say like

bro lety pretty cute get job waymo
making self driving car everywhere bad long term people using car environmentally friendly way continue mass public transport much better perhaps would support self driving bus encourage using car altogether favor walking biking
also autonomous vehicle road result vehicle road meaning wasted energy road congestion le safety pedestrian course video sponsored waymo wont mention woefully unfunded public transit sake balance safety environment veritasium make video promoting benefit walking biking taking bustrain
agree instead investing public transport people want invest car street look biggest city europe great public transport move million people living
probably prerequisite autonomous bus bus much harder drive company need people buy rent vehicle fund rd youre going buy bus theyre working car edit also public transportation really good city suburb rural area use car much autonomous taxisuber service would work though
autonomous driving future family car instead many family car well use autonomous taxi instead autonomous taxi probably serve need family thats better environment cheaper everyone buying car problem peak rush hour people working home le issue future society gradually adapt may worker start day simply extend rush hour peak reduce total number autonomous car required serve everyone make fare cheaper also public transport improved instead bus seat people driver route may autonomous shuttle seat without driver many route may even service people propose tailored public transport route people vote popular one get put service like car pooling flexible one big limitation public transport frequency strictly limited driver without driver could bus shuttle arriving every minute
yaomtc would result vehicle road mean would replacing human driver road wouldnt net neutral result car communicating one another congestion would significantly reduced since mostly result poor driving cause butterfly effect would safer pedestrian since pedestrian injury result human driver would remain feel like point made wrong painting picture autonomous future

imagine wanting hijack someone youd need megaphonesiren fool car pulling
im sure better average case sure fully automated car could improve driving safety standpoint finally driving car wouldnt dangerous help big data could optimize speed braking fuel saving like driving way several time knowing speed limit start rolling arrive speed limit without brake automated car could first time mention driving without safety distance dont need one car driving connected network traffic jam hope take le year really doubt least cheap option majority driver look electric car still expensive

modern car already computer could hacked different
parome access something afar someone else car already standard wifi connection

im super excited driverless carssince driving mundane drive grocery store drive work precovid drive hockey arena drive ikea boring would gladly give said think ill keep motorcycle time want get rip miss shifting
h going soo wasted
work ndot nevada see driver cellphone also see lot accident driver fatigue get tired regular day driving difficult time job luckily coworkers take one u tired drive saying fully autonomous driving vehicle would major blessing road
think driverless car really good thing make privacy right repair even important question
dont discussion get paid argument pretty please missing lot point
good video bit bias since sponsored tho ok waymo closed circuit premap circuit right car cant drive anywhere start war tesla autopilot billion mile v milion mile waymo data key ai
driverless car cool idea ultimately theyre distraction future transit fuckin train subway light rail freight train shipping car dead end technology thats literally killing planet inefficient move around two ton metal transport one four human selfdriving car paper crack place train arent practical whatever specific reason solution nearly every problem car isnt make different kind car make goddamn train
biggest fear would electrical failure software failure high speed appears rarer possible human failure
one nontrivial component economy left list car insurance form
hoped would come europe soon well germany actually want leading role ready get road regulation time alive
id like know much driverless car save running cost eg wear tear tyre brake etc comparison keep awesome work derek
given small trip slammed brake hard enough chirp tyre probably much
people make mistake ai perfect every aspect result zero accident
till go blizzard cant see foot front road change every foot
rolling shutter issue type vehicle usually led

people seem misconception autonomous vehicle made convenience instead safety selfdriving car made sit back relax made reduce accident save life people vehicle always need pay attention like pilot still need cockpit technology never guarantee future vehicle still u looking road difference wont hand wheel
hell someone run stationary vehicle
texting sure
year start commom thing nowdays technology still need bit refining super good dont get wrong still need tweak road country economy stuff
buddy mine navy fighter jet maintenance u aircraft carrier said dont use autopilot landing unless emergency tail hook hit cable accurately place unnatural volume wear tear
couldnt trained autopilot hit accurately somewhere else le wear tear
already sleep way anywhere use train live place good public transport p
must nice
people still afraid fly human good emotional good evaluating risk
cant wait fkn hate driving
whenever people used say dumb ill say well would u rather people around driving computer make replacing driver everyone think amazing driver
im sorry comparison computer landing bad weather human making mistake crashing laughably absurd human landing bad weather year using instrument without crashing without computer control aircraft would better compare san francisco crash caused human error crash caused computer failure none might happened yet mean none ever happen go driverless car remember correctly already involved accident caused death
would great long distance taxi replacement call app also cost human driver support actual living being also buy cant drag racedriftgarage moddo anything fun probably would cost liver become unusable like year would chance get first car cheap
people crash speeding go speed limit time ive also driven maximum speed possible kmh
many people work wonder end
get traffic jam bunch car need siren pull pas awesome
reliable long distance public transportation powered renewable energy source car okay
absolutely love idea driverless car fully board discussion video would increase safety improve environmental infrastructure one big spectre hanging whole video make question practicality likelihood becoming mainstream anytime soon capitalism corporation dont care many death prevent theyll gladly allow death mean profit technology become exceptionally cheap somehow still generating huge profit company never going adopted en masse
sorry love driving riding motorcycle pas get nice car bike love commuting work believe love going twisty road weekend cant really understand people would want self driven car
thanks lot
driverless car pretty cool increase safety thats bad thing couple pet peeve thing presented video pretty long comment dont want read important thing opinion public transport completely ignored video explained detail last paragraph argument autonomous elevator plane imply valid direct comparison however arent really comparable driverless car ignore plane find runway using infrastructure airport localizer system still become clear even though plane sky autopilot plane elevator essentially operating without traffic driverless car meet requirement able follow road turn driveway parking lot may actually even able case may rely road marking depending used irrelevant clear concern people selfdriving car argument driver experience come similar flaw yes system much data human could ever collect road human learn magnitude faster machine machine need exponentially data match human achieve given amount experience course difference data huge likely still valid argument presented much extreme actually autonomous car drive confidently pass mental check doesnt mean would actually well extreme situation human likely see somewhat easily good driver overall impossible predict sure point gap autonomous driving system may become apparent situation never came training data car maybe chooses handle badly doesnt discredit safety driverless car overall situation unlikely kind play argument ethic discussion noted especially autonomous black box system big difference feeling safe safe human driver cause effect especially judgement passenger autonomous vehicle also evaluate human passenger far le likely otherwise good driver incredibly specific weakness doesnt make autonomous car unsafe fact sit back comfortable doesnt validate advantage autonomous driving presented achievable higher safety carbased system expanding public transport would also ecological course advantage selfdriving car convenient take start destination directly without walking switching vehicle worth discussing whether alone enough make driverless car preferable option one might even argue going give safety compared public transport sake convenience might well give even convenience owning car disregarding discussing convenience safety comfort capacity environmental impact public transport autonomous car comparison one another make lot sense personally feel main point video certainly left altogether
issue nothing technology absolutely work perfectly described video doubt solve hacking problem connected internet hacked hacked someone access billion ton projectile around world time work perfectly one wiser anytime anywhere could turned terrorist weapon solve issue golden love technology completely agree otherwise video
make city one able drive car autonomous
would say difference car airplane car way variable deal airplane doesnt
plane still pilot anyway
airplane stuff clever way make sound like weather issue addressed without actually addressing fact car cant deal bad weather
dave lidar vehicle autonomous vehicle rely impacted thing much human vision also setup human driver couple foot behind large windshield much le easily obstructed small aperture vehicle sensor rely third human still better extrapolating incomplete information demonstrated capacity ai system developed vehicle truth thinking le visual obstruction dealing uncleared road large snowfall many road cue obstructed visual obstruction problem there reason thing tested place like phoenix socal
see autonomus vehicle able safely traverse offroad track think thats ready
yeah cuz lot offroad track middle big city
actually darpa challenge lot easier navigating city
related kept coming sounded strange new zealand ditched term accident vehicle crash many decade ago accident implies fault whereas reality vehicle crash almost always fault could avoided guess human driver usa term accident finally become redundant
problem cost
dont mind diverless car wonder reliability hardware used car know common item phone computer etc work properly many year happen car cant assume make hardware last decade even maintenance wont enough look possible failure car solve throw away car couple year maybe salvage part recycle others prevent equipment getting old itd work would also kind waste selling old part could cause massive issue thats way deal even rare might accident caused new one might failure one hardware piece prevented work driverless car company make competition cant say driverless car better safer x car company isnt really way quantify hand happens many company make driverless car accident happens one car one company going ruin fun everyone else cause massive repercussion one company anywho thats take know new technology world adapt fully dismiss im worried im hopeful driverless car
car drive invented age ago theyre called taxi captain senseofdirections
another prediction simpson season episode maximum homerdrive
vehicle get smart enough drive human cause human cause accident
hate bus dislike taxi think id ok id like go see feel see cost go work compare total cost owning running car see could cheaper theory
havent subscribed year see minute advertisement substance hope got lot money worst video youve ever published
thats nice could start one night stand cab

per mile driven driverless car way deadly human driven vehicle even close technology yet

thanks showcasing autonomous vehicle easy digestible manner became aware andrew yang running campaign automation risk truck driver losing job
here problem driverless car going make people even stupid ignorant already automate thing le people willing learn
autonomous car generally safer human driver main risk scenario system doesnt function correctly reason like getting hacked malicious party like hostile foreign government could potentially cause sudden widespread chaos isnt unique autonomous car though affect virtually networked public infrastructure particularly power grid likely political equivalent firing nuke unlikely anyone would actually even could aside though computer almost certainly going safer human driver

nichtzukennen saying guy
super video many thanks cheer eddy
suck unsubscribed
always said go statistic driverless car statistically safer go said motorbike way fun get traffic faster
driverless car best everyone one traffic would literally disappear
save time
lived phoenix decade tell road far far easier drive around many place
theyre almost always dry
fully driverless guy watching thru camera rain car stop completely
better way make traveling safer probably completely get rid car
ok case fatal accident happens autonomous system fault would made responsible brought justice
company made car
rbin mean ceo would face jail time would one system developersprogrammers
confident much safer certain come poland time soon
road wouldnt need build wide
ok happens car get hacked software hackable safty mechanism case
dude isnt fast furious sure could hack car would super hard dont get anything
rbin sadly enough reason hard people example week month ago petrolgas problem america basically froze entire country one company hacked imagine one could achieve hacking car state program crush strategically different carsobjects could froze entire country gain actually lot power sorry english good explain idea perfectly trust doable hollywood realty cyber security actually worse movie
id like know bit surprised veritasium didnt ask gracefully performance degrades case instance several camera stop working drive onehanded glass get broken selfdriving car

wonder driving construction zone paint street straight wrong
well dont rely line road many camera lidar radar system million way find way something like construction zone
thats also one obvious first exceptional situation engineer thought trained system
hanneshelmholz true construction take wide range form hoping would discussed sort thing video opposed looking ideal road condition
live az see van driving around time ive seen many driving fairly confusing construction zone without problem idk exactly use successful testing definitely capable
danielfay nice would also interested see bad weather something going find phoenix dont weather
helmet problem ridiculous attribute higher education gone college come something stupid
bit silly title people actually want driverless car road yet question moral decision swerve hit child save passenger hit tree save child decided even addressed talked question like need figured throw driverless car onto road thought obvious people look technology seriously
obviously havent watched entire video yet adresses issue
rbin watch video address point saying paraphrased unlikely dont need figure first disagree point stand need figure first btw im big proponent self driving car im luddite see enormous benefit possible dont think good idea figure stuff trial error human life
youve massively overstated ready automation driving many typical driving situation automation elevator plane work much better large part circumstance environment operation much wellcontrolled
really driving autonomously one last thing miss need efford better invested renewable energy electric car

driverless car might kill le contribute much climate change traffic moving away car culture daily commute using driverless bus mass transit option opinion way forward sustainable future
like charge even dangerous period like driving would never buy self driving car every time get new car first thing disabling much electronic possible driver dont want wonder algorithm going easily foresee human driver behavior probably wont able computer driven car worry car make manual driving complex know rationale behind security argument cutting live world already extremely safe safety regulation invading every field human activity sucking life excitement driving safe wouldnt fun hiking safe wouldnt fun meddling around home workshop safe wouldnt fun risk essential part life essential part men woman dont take away u
nothing happy
street ride emptyish id love see one merge la rush hour navigate hov multiple ridersand switch lane back get exit properly merge dangerously slowly without car site dont try btw id ride one anyday white wouldnt nice beigebrown better showing dirt oh wait would get rid human involvement even hmmm could computer robot determine much dirt dirty enough wash cool
think important understand autonomous situation video example plane used think example worth extrapolating plane far away better flying pilot chosen example prove exactly however people still better decisionmaking bad weather pilot let plane fly decide landing worth taking instrument functioning controller allowing land etc people still needed focus big picture wellunderstood mechanic flying driving taken vehicle person choosing vehicle go vehicle figure get side note autonomous vehicle quite far away replacing manned combat system enormous amount complex decision human need make combat order successful unmanned system certainly complement manned system drone plane tank ready replace manned system
want global thing
video mostly discussed want autonomous vehicle get detail wouldnt want autonomous vehicle yes self driving car safer still didnt mention hacker unlikely hacker could use autonomous vehicle terrorism wouldnt scary step autonomous vehicle knowing moment car could suddenly mind u dont even care dangerous drive manually truth accident human error major accident addition chance getting accident chance course mile km would autonomous vehicle drive bad road condition say icy stepped autonomous vehicle would able stay road climate change real climate change causing hazardous weather turn hazardous road condition would good autonomous vehicle could drive bad condition look like theyre smart enough yet think autonomous vehicle may ruin driver experience many example los angeles excellent public transportation yet many people still drive car part reason people drive like drive instead sit bus point point b even mean sitting traffic hour hour still drive car
well waymo system really fully autonomous mainly outside prescanned area guess noone scan high detail whole world nice usable area fully autonomous really
ever drive pakistan car cause accident xd pakistan traffic insane
im waiting btw dont trust people driving thats ill never driving exam ill really hope wait till car appear dont worry anything way
remember ad
thats ilegal
much doubt even legal human drive lot country within year
every time watch one video talk time traffic light traffic continuously flow intersection think people car
people want drive classic car cause matter many driverless car put road common get there still going lot people want drive car early day driving especially golden age car design like
push button second car stop like every pedestrian crosswalk youve ever seen
kitsunelegend people didnt want give riding horse transportation time change theyll find somewhere else indulge effectively become hobby
ricobarth probably system still need timed similar today traffic densely back area self driving car useful also pedestrian traffic stop every time person press button traffic worse today honestly think likely either traffic light remain noncars eventually car moved underground pedestrian way moved point u car subway train job fine self driving car step phasing car
brandocorp except people still ride horse transportation fact there massive country wide community still us horse buggy get around still use horse drawn machine plow harvest field still use candle lantern light home tv internet speak still wear clothes look like taken straight yet still manage interact everyone else modern world problem look amish community believe especially pennsylvania amish live work around people time know well
tesla fanboys gon na get crazy
hell yeah
feel like theyve saying year year
car best environment ist one doesnt drive
lidar multiple car interfere
hope one day online grid selfdriving car canshould opt essentially selfdriving car lidar work together filling data around vision beyond visually accessible car connected online grid car see around corner building car emerging underground tunnel cyclist motorcycle join grid possibility endless time calculate driving eventually every car put shareable interconnected grid dont see possible get accident car selfdriving
waymo experience equate human experience human see stop sign able identify stop sign situation waymo ai would need thousand million example could reliably identify stop sign saying youd drive thousand year gain experience false said ultimately selfdriving vehicle get point better human driver handle nearly situation fine
difference driverless car plane plane zero visual processing thats hard part said every day amazed safe flight
said airplane bad weather youd want plane flying incorrect autoland would preferredneeded bad visibility bad weather autoland would work light wind windy condition autopilot would discontinuedisconnect
probably meant foggy weather mentioned bad weather agree low visibility appropriate case rainy windy weather cancel landing anyway even human pilot impossible worth risk specially commercial airline
youre partially wrong plane land without pilot light wind condition able exact thing hurrican provided enough data ia ask market airplane manufacturer provide costy risky technology already existing need ask
anikdey exactly modern autopilot system disengage severe weather condition level automation cant deal stuff human must able mass passenger transport way go automobile
azypk asking airline would pay lot safety requirement mass air transit much greater look happened max common failure caused loss three aircraft airbus automaton flight law designed stop pilot stupid thing caused crash edge case much powerful ai prof technology limited
iitool human cant usually deal either risk dangerous landing go someplace safer dilemma exists airline choose latter option time
understand first iteration driverless car fine concern around programmer writing code future update software ai addressing software element nature bug normal software window automatic update often break fix thing every patch low quality see software day driverless car waiting see software process testing enough considering future update ai human still write driving software even drive car yes know ai learn
see five year asshole siren ruining everybodys schedual
driverless car definitely something coming sooner later say going solve traffic problem impossible future replacing car public transport making short trip possible foot bike solution today traffic problem
doesnt matter computer drive im fine always stick right want drive safety valid reason take freedom away cool tech work though
human get easily distracted sitting traffic watching video
part talk replacing vehicle driverless one fast possible prevent death reminds bit rokos basilisk
afraid eternally punished thinking automated car
im assuming steering wheel placed safety feature case manual steering needed cu company us car designed technology around established design car isnt necessary make custom self driving car comfort thing customer many question derek also dont think going cut personal car though cu emergency personal car blessing good video derek loved
autonomous car motorcycle interested driving invested ongoing training
got first car backup camera still turn around look behind force habit there something actually seeing eye
safety big issue enforce public transportation self driving car get safer average driver maybe efficient trafficwise also love tech want stuff improve worry missing huge variable advanced autonomy freedom driving unique experience human achieve well neutering ourselfs taking away tactile skill think ultimately bad u way eventually wont need hand task hand example putting touchscreen everywere making electric system without mechanical tactile feedback reason gaming controller nice tactile clicky button feel nice give feedback end day watched star war first time liked watching han solo thing flyingfighting vehicle wouldnt seeing sit back press button leave autopilot racing could driverless car racing whats point really want see driver thing
first public transport feasible lot people way get doorstep work oftentimes way go said automated public transport definitely something become widespread although already kind exists case metro rail driver mostly automated losing experience driving worth million people dying car accident every year dont worry wont lose hand longer drive
nicosuavemente chill nobody losing hand talking trend needing use hand getting experience forgetting skill make life like learning ride bike thats experience option would like something forced
htislog driving car skill make life maybe genuinely vital vast majority people people used live life without driving car even today many people live whole life without getting behind wheel anecdotally got license soon possibly could wait self driving car driving experience life value care im going got come car
nicosuavemente get thats propably people feel think car big part population also anecdotally much lot petrolheads enjoy go ride personally think car exoskeleton give range person different way experiencing world think exoskeleton would like option control carried away like bus
definitely get behind sentiment almostbutnotquite selfdriving car worse either fully autonomous fully manual people still need pay attention theyve got little actually moment moment theyre going get distracted might take attention lapse sooner later
self driving car safe train safe space efficient
autonomous vehicle definitely major improvement need speed limit based human behaving poorly fully adaptive system restriction side organ donor tend come road traffic accident reduction needle death significantly reduce availability organ transplant
wrong q automated system accepted ppl need far better best human yes im sure exists good enough eliminate situation inattentive human fail definitely robot better best attentive human accepted imo
make legal liability fall rider theyd road time good luck people whod willing take liability though
question lidar cause interference way time radio switch randomly passing car would issue every car using lidar radar even different frequency
refuse radiated one death trap
want autonomous car steering wheel possibility take im fine sleep freeway car wake hour earlier go level bad road better driver know ok play phonesleep must control
population think theyre aboveaverage driver weird thing thats actually possible let say rate people driving scale star let say star driver star driver average star population average im saying thats thing actually split distribution like pretty uncommon thing follow bell curve interesting there mathematical rule average

hardest thing selfdriving car execute predict people road going react situation predicting weather month easier
im sure million mile road entire fleet share give car extremely good intuition derek pointed predict many different weighted possibility make decision really stop focusing edge case accept human make really dumb mistake think wont happen u let admit human make mistake autonomous car really make big change
wait never drive car schedule call one go

oh people drive african country already p personally dont mind idea driverless car depending strictly follow road regulation normal behavior could see human driver getting frustrated driving erratically producing unusual edgecase situation question like motorcyclist explore delve really interesting sometimes unrealistic moral dilemma conclusion also think driverless car way really another form public transportation depending theyre implemented though many city country currently could certainly adopted effectively state people pointed beyond lot question went unanswered video starting technology lidar already well documented significant health risk people animalseyes world already enormous amount radio wave transmission sure google handful car right say tenth vehicle road driverless rely lidar significant portion information outside world general population ethical question well google already renowned incredibly intrusive selling user data whats say wouldnt use information car im aware tesla utilizing different technology driverless feature lot thing worth considering there sort automation like whats technology put risk alternative exploitable
id also like add weve smart phone twenty year still dealing firmware update crash apps dont work seamlessly woth technology thats going car fault utopian idea sold right around corner almost jaded sooo much deal technology doesnt work cause place car run company software cool thatll never happen always human driving car simple utility pleasure something freeing able drive connection car idea gas car always gas car always someone want hear soul car long people ride horse well people riding gas car driving lot le course buuuuuut take place place like city newyork lot world still moving agree thing change idea changing completely hogwash future never seems shift absolute become conplex bigger freedom option
th century million people killed road really one blame car accident famously evolved along human urban planing decision ww effected whatsoever
may become mainstream still take time driver fade away there lot people drive hell
nahh dont trust robot life isnt capable thinking beyond calculation
aviation autopilot like level pilot monitor take control see something wrong electronic decide turn ex reading two different instrument dont match
arguements solid looking regular car v autonomous car arguement could used argue replacing large part trafic city train subway light rail
personally think human driver part picture time people like drive think law banning human road unlikely least near future unlikely lawmaker go people even good
sorry dereck video seems biased comparing transportation mode different using falacious argument yes bad driver doesnt make ok bad autonomous vehicle bad driver still identify person wearing stop sign tshirt stop sign technology ready dont believe ever
biggest question stuff like snow ice making sure car manage difficult condition live norway much variable condition pheonix probably solvable probably take quite year
great idea get car thats used infected people wait outside store heat ride home shopping get ad blasted entire trip camera watching tracked marketing there way cheaper car youre going consuming product without option animation av traffic never show pedestrian

cause road accident people think better driver really
people love talk many distance unit self driving car fleet driven compare human fail note comparing apple orange human might learn much much le fully autonomous vehicle please stop using argument concentrate stuff make autonomous vehicle better human guided vehicle get really want see world fully autonomous vehicle norm want actually drive need new driver license much stricter requirement unlike pilot license
human driven car probably going like horse theyre going away infrastructure required present anymore standard use hobby want experience rich hundred year article anachronistic law like wyoming myth bring horse school principal must take care class car art arent going away way still frontier day calgary stampede future isnt going built around
really extraordinary see far driverless car come there good reason test phoenix arizona weather far know car still cant handle little bit rain fall leaf snow additionally american road easy comparison road country term layout signalling there still long way go
sure would nerve try yet great demo would interested another indepth look limitation example live canada lot time road road line obscured level snow cover well work night unlit area rain ice etc affect smart enough know snow tire monitor tpms even much gas left time oil change route controlled change mind enroute want go somewhere else encounter detour handle mechanical failure like flat tire lot area explore
classic carefully ignoring real downside video main concern software software crashed sure isnt impossible car way complex elevator bug visual computation like misinterpreting limit line im automomous driving dont paint like already viable
yet car cruise control handle hill without significant issue issue increasing automation adding equipment lidar need someone who competent behind wheel thanks
car doesnt go road doesnt hit stationary object human human thing
rest storyask software engineer call cat dog blowing plastic bag etc honestthey say soft target
absolutely get driverless car road whats equally maybe even important getting fewer car road driving done absolutely necessary like hauling big stuff driverless rideshare program like waymo would perfect even nondriverless one say driverless car eliminate parking lot public transport already need transport people light cargo train way safer way way space effective people grown car dependent place terrible public transport dont see blaming anyone course please watch couple video bike youll understand
canadian im curious car handle snow driving info
soon would guess waymo trained sunny wide open well paved place reason dont expect take much challenge time soon right whats important company lack failure build trust mean easiest possible area like arizona programmer played ml guess would take couple year adapt software would commit put car road experiment let learn environment dont see company willing yet hand serious wide release cant think better way train car put canada put rocky mountain put rural louisiana road road sign idea concrete reality year theyd able handle anything thats something company like tesla might waymo seems caution like
jameshughes awesome quick reply thanks
maybe city could install line street car would able use orientation
romplom bad idea would expensive would probably save money health care emergency service long run
derek loved episode could one current development autonomous driving retrofit technology easycheap covert current vehicle autonomous vehicle engineering barrirers retrofitting
waymo utilizing deep learning enough tesla mobileeye pas soon
like steiner offensive save day
report four european transport group estimated million truck driving job u europe could become redundant thus eliminated effort aimed widely deploying selfdriving commercial vehicle successful fleetowner
place egypt still driver elevator idea
person make mistake guilty know name blame machine wrong designer programmer car subject jurisdiction go
programmer aviation geek would like say making plane fly far easier making car drive might sound counterintuitive think plane think flying direction altitude perhaps following signal something like vor beacon il approach thats cat iii il approach impressive sure come plane following signal runway using ground radar determine flare admittedly simplification get gist also traffic announces thing like adsb exception small ga plane even often equipped collision avoidance largely automated car luxury yet meanwhile car many many parameter take account way unpredictable even though move le dimension driver type vehicle bike truck pedestrian animal traffic signal road sign emergency vehicle weather obscuring vision list go good weather road condition unexpected situation technology currently work million billion edge case still throw technology loop look video waymo car run construction zone froze middle lane middle traffic got stuck minute trying navigate busy parking lot waymo car even take route way longer avoid certain intersection minimize left turn turning minute ride one take double yes level work caveat weather nice unexpected thing happen imo itll couple year yet least true level achieved always technology often develops exponentially period stagnation followed leap forward breakthrough discovered know could completely wrong
please include standard unit everyone u uk canada liberia samoa palau micronesia marshall island myanmar
canada us metric mostly
love exited security like hacking cyber attack malfunction dont want spread fear im scared
im guessing pull whole fleet road inclement weather would like see one driving snow slick road night
thought well im guessing software programmed appropriate response slide road partially completely obscured snow pack drift lidar would also likely get quite confused moisture air torrential downpour snow storm whiteout condition perhaps combination lidar radar would innovation
first problem cost nice radar stuff cost deliver mass consumer mean price cut compromise like luxury item tesla premium car second problem drive car brings pleasure certain amount people freedom driving like elevator appliance tottally driverlesswhy making exciting car racing there human factor immediate pleasure driverless cool driven around something else specially one cant drive driverless traffic boring life
experience countless dashcam video compilation say truly disgusting people driving around sort wrong dangerous stuff get car automated control entire road essentially error accident unless something environment caused car
use logic data abolish human laborer position fun sometimes risky task deemed dangerous new safe zero tolerance future human driver real problem poor people cant afford lazer rig problem people eventually sneer chevelle pas onto son one day death trap smog machine even though time son driving first hand knowledge function since helped repaired maintained every piece penny dollar modern equivalent
road construction good
real question company data collect year hope facebook took project
cool tech ill never stop driving car driving fun cant replaced ai ai drive fun
one reason az freaking awesome
dont know questionable technology safety stuff aside would want move world driverless car absolutely get agree case people disability mr steve vision problem think truly amazing blind person get around car otherwise healthy perfectlyfunctional people question put machine charge perfectly capable swear god world going shitter man willingly letting skynet take quite literally
city hall building driver elevator still operation day automatic one beside driver isnt theyve kept since building built art deco inside
unless accounted far technology isnt functional entire video stupid drive everything perfect around sure achieve unless something like work everywhere going anywhere elevator operator airplane comparison also stupid road condition human acting real time entirely different situation elevator airplane sky smart derik know
hopefully make safer ride motorcycle v dealing driver phone
issue engineer put local limit put global limit one car nice highway fairly controlled circumstance dozen time might convince pretty safe perform well time time set limit extreme test also social economic consequence potentially replacing occupation employ people transit machine one generation plan million unemployed people making supremely unethical
thats amazing question maybe dumb cant get ahead lidar work shooting beam light reading let say two car road side side arent beam one going corrupt reading know tesla also us technology ive heard supplement sensor use different wavelength enough usable wavelength substitute cara planet
come airplane landing automation work well fog little wind well turbulent condition
yeah dumb analogy
im willing use everyday life
think biggest concern driverless car right default error handling state brake often wrong choice snowy icy climate training data cover lot mile diverse enough set area car trained driving arizona may really good driving az would probably handle area well car trained driving california may really good driving ca would handle area well certainly concern well feel like two thing biggest challenge getting broad av adoption
great content derek would love see mechanical issue flat tire covered reservation
good point guess tire pressure sensor monitoring easily detect flat mechanical issue think could extent rely human passenger pressing help button report issue remote operator safely bring kerb support driver team come transfer another waymo
nettlesoup yeah didnt mean theyre solvable issue ive yet see video driverless car cover area fault occur thats fine would like see car responds know lot thing cant computer monitored like faulty bearing something probably car would pull safe
harrymarston yes suppose human correlate increased noise frequency knocking pitch rubbing speed realise bad sound coming car something akin external internal speaker ought work selfdiagnosis potential issue
get rid human driver would problem robot follow rule human convenient
quality video high
mentioned car looking possibility isnt normal good driver key thing computer see far consistent assigning probability option
issue self driving car v self flying plane plane self driving car issue dont trust car thing computer seen people dumb thing road city arent always good enough computer fully understand
video sponsored waymo firstly important note ad one science communication video derek normally inherently self driving car even near future fully believe saver human driving problem partial solution problem way bigger north america sub urban sprawl car dependency european maybe drive month longer trip transport something big actually enjoy act driving hardly get traffic jam rest time actually much convenient faster walk bike take public transport daily commute would urge american start fixing infrastructure public transport dont spend much time recourse kind bandaids american city incredible debt post war suburb basically ponzy scheme tax resident enough maintain road high way parking space everybody need car everything keep building going deeper dept self driving car neat trust definitely future society think solution north america commuting problem
reason wont happen would require collective action ive seen u far individualistic
believe analysis good shallow root problem sadly much deeper american dont want public transit see zero sum game dollar spent public transit tax dollar stolen real question convince majority american thing better break inertia political deadlock existential crisis america maybe planet help learn convince people intransigent antiscience problem may continue spiral terrifying chance american democracy simply dead year flatearthers antivaxxers global warming denier charge next year maybe dooming u
dustinandrews hard go deep complex topic youtube comment believe public transit option walk bike drive take public transit choose combination basically anywhere netherlands europe convenient others time car isnt best option see denser place u pre world war becomes fundamentally changing city structured highly recommend youtube channel bike especially strong town series
dustinandrews gave initial question bit thought try flip try convince echo centric people wouldnt much better half driver sit youre daily traffic jam would take bike public transport could drive every want without traffic youre life would much better public transport without ride
mubangadnb sadly argument fallen deaf ear even washington state around seattle voter killed public transit funding demand road capacity car question metaquestion fractured nature american politics everything become u v instead discussion
self driving car like bus without busdriver worth somethinggermany problem insurance maybe miss use selfdriving car like drohne heavy enough kill somebody impact come gps face recognition cable cam hardware sure backdoor problem
ah yes driverless car would safer like rail maybe environmentally friendly efficient per passenger heavy battery something like external power source like power line could work pantograph something country institutional racism le prevalent public segregation wasnt thing efficient public transportation device called train see work visit southeast asia europe
wan na see versus f driver nascar driver
havent even learned driving dont let autonomous already
assuming live india ai learn lot might take yr u see indian road
bleep actually nepal yeah might guessed right ai guess dont like people assuming without first asking
sagarshrestha sorry low chance non indian username assumed sorry
bleep taught something assumption bad learn assuming thing
sagarshrestha yes
think accident impossible autonomous car limited visibility poor judgment misjudgment distance speed intoxication rage stress lack sleep number dozen human weakness im motorcycle rider well id feel safer knowing even half car road driven human
might wait little bit driverless bike though
important question would willing drive self driving bike want others changing
romplom fall bike werent paying attention tho
motorcycle rider well know mean fear time running disagree seanhodgins transition time fully autonomous car road take long benefit dying stuff big soon reached car talk want abolish traffic light waste time yes solution pedestrian turn abolish manual driving dont think autonomous motorcycle much fun still cant wait happen driving something future generation look back say wtf thinking
ummmmm dont work computer industrial computer much put major issue automated manufacturing equipment modern day like know video make look nice car company constant maintenance make car look perform best possible demo get million make sure like half arent upkept standard make sure another getting bare minimum maintenance needed keep road guarantee alot problem become much obvious mention huge security risk thing pose
india still uncommon find elevator driver especially mall
exactly push button
probably salary cheaper technology
mrdeaz lol thats isnt even thing elevator fully automatic like one found anywhere else guess driver like security certain public place
mrdeaz would assume one using technology rather team people pulling elevator instead using button
arpadrideg make sure nobody confusing toilet shit corner elevator
surprised didnt mention tesla self driving tech
mention lol
inferior le camera lidr video autonomous sponsored
video sponsored waymo there way theyre going give advertising competitor
car obviously designed today rider mind dont need front seat actual steering wheel even frontdriver facing mirror
unlike time headnshoulders ad cant really judge much video analisys much ad car play way much bias think human driver banned asap
nice car get stuck traffic take subway
think automated elevator missing key point elevator run self sufficiently without connection network something self driving car best knowledge even could surely law would mandate monitor record lot parameter ex gps telemetry maybe vitals driver etc data car uniquely tied im worried self driving car arent safe sure theyre lot safer average human capable im worried privacy ethical concern come especially leaked data snowden recently worryingly project pegasus
long freedom exists america government never able stop people driving car sure people today seem happy give freedom name safetybut people wont covid made million people realize important freedom period there estimated million new gun owner last year alone let sink minute
thank
give year maybe ca neer perfect close way yet
poor video standard mean said sponsored feel like infomercial veritasium video showcased good didnt comment challenge limitation technology showcase car working single area comment handle thing like roadworks police officer directing traffic thats thing happen area trained safe city state country done get working
see transition period driven vehicle including bicycle require transmitter driverless vehicle easily detect mobile phone would already job peds
know also reduces amount car accident fewer people driving car first place vastly increasing public transport solution way go autonomous vehicle certainly good thing definitely best strategy future transportation
driverless vehicle waste time money already outdated within five year flying vehicle
part pushback think tesla marketing calling full self driving isnt yet people treat way dont think self driving car people dont trust people using themwaymo better geofenced currently limited strange place everything flat well paved sunny wide open need better communication public thats love kind video
one advantage fully autonomous car replace manually driven car car communicate another traffic sign could get abundant
insurance company perfect customer someone pay premium never get accident autonomous vehicle already better human driver thing see make transition difficult well human deep connection car like control
id prefer improved public transportation
great video exciting technology
waymo gimmick
work pour snow handle slippy road
problem hack one army even without totally hacking one driverless car easy trick paint new line street put fake sign stuff human would fall people robbing car rare inherent threat youll run would longer true robber could stand middle road confident car would stop kid might make game stopping people malicious funny dont know consequence manual override could solve least problem least long still remember drive
would even want take ride one instead driving cool muscle car
safety offer huge another big selling point think often get missed lety touched briefly end instead wasting time hour daily commute people spend time playing game making phone call texting whatever time longer wasted
problem autonomous vehicle distribution google stadium example issue relies data broadband exists big city exclusive also lot tweaking might needed company step like communication protocol etc
seemed obvious guess im target audience
fully autonomous vehicle full self driving tesla strategy doesnt really look superior sure racking million mile autopilot data depending pre mapped road modelization looking fsd beta v autopilot thats available anyone tesla bringing incremental improvement version problem noone know iteration converging safe fsd need another multiple computer camera upgrade many software refactorings radar vision pure vision require
good condition well there answer babysit system probably feasible part world
sponsor video would like shut
toxicityassured pay buck
show u driving night rain snow heavy traffic bright sunny day little traffic paid commercialfor waymo alternative opinion reasonable skepticism dissenting voice talking downside
find interesting tesla want switch fully vision based autonomous vehicle mean get rid lidar sensor
think reason driverless car thought far away basically dont enough driverless car le room human error interfere driverless car put situation wouldnt possible road full automated car making sense think sorta happen wont ever happen like elevator thing guess
girl representing waymo evil
fully autonomous coming soon think old car people still driving could still road next year
cant wait psychopath hack driverless car kill lol
car road autonimos wouldnt lidar interfere
possible lidar sensor interfere one another sensor tech getting better time including ignoring interference sensor
pmr rehab doctor implication automated vehicle patient significant disability serious injury stroke brain injury spinal cord injury amputation neurodegenerative disease severe traumatic orthopedic injury enormous see patient clinic month initial injury return driving question almost always arise injury significant never go back driving others much rehab therapy return driving others need adapted vehicle hand function impaired unable use right foot case currently driver road injury think ask good human driver driver next road may stroke also consider social gathering implication need designated driver anyway im thanks informative video derek also live phoenix great see city represented
dont consequence human destructive unemployed million move car train thanks
car used time stone see million possible outcome
far wrong car process incoming data much faster human like took day get across intersection plenty time game scenario though noticed telsa great predicting car thats degree go say someone made right turn ahead soon get way around corner clearly way tesla hard brake think going opposite direction block lane
love driver seatbelt buckled self driving car
driveless driver stay seat case accident lol rality might easier buckle seat beat disable via software
safety issue isnt driverless car rest driver
came phoenix didnt even stop say hello
curious hear russell brand would say recent video
something correct level driver allowed look back whatever available second normally second really situation car know nothing also sorry statement end seems pretty dumb know good every people want car rather renting one also taxi service us waymo company cause replace taxi driver future wont free either please stop making dramatic ending music would change everything life time spend waymo exact time would spend car difference one sleep fun gaming fun driving car also wasnt word different circumstance like weather etc waymo saying serious con well
level thingy see scam tell driver stop paying attention need alert respond within second driver paying attention bad moment car asks help human le able fully aware going respond correctly remember paying full attention either even thing driving work either pay attention otherwise mistake happen
ikocheratcr second enough get mind back traffic according statistic try im saying look whats around room take le five second need max second maybe car would probably phone one hand also second minimum car must allow normal situation second longer according interview mercedes worker
leogronung know think according statistic case test aware performing test think state mind interesting
autonomous car yes car sharing option hell corrupt government could easily prevent leaving home
percent people average driver possible percent people median driver
nice catch
although possible think likely driving skill normally distributed
think time since read woman rate men avarege datingapps
wts diff median avg sry dumb question
rishabh average data divided amount responder median middle line answer systematic line sort
waymo vehicle encounter another autonomous vehicle using lidar exactly wavelength either vehicle get confused
elevator plane comparable car elevator go rail interact others elevator rail plane landing il also different human pilot plane human atc tower make sure plane using runway example comparable autonomous car car interact many car many human driver human worker road changing condition road ready signal designed human il designed computer still technology ready spread
security cyber attack thats worry even employee car company thats mind decides crash car purpose situation impossible right
im sure theyre possible way le likely car accident done human
funnily enough said elevator year k due szcary bug grow fear
jacopobazzocchi im talking bug although might worth concern im talking sabotage would way easier
birdtower driving software car remote need inside car access first need get key need know car admin code way easier cut brake regular car let smash access software
jacopobazzocchi highly doubt driving software hardware independent example costumer identification requires internet connection also think would way efficient kind centralized remote control car manufacturer taxi company waymo site mention cybersecurity saying paramount importance dont doubt statement show cyber attack indeed possibility
poll technology mentioned answered ready due government regulation overcome order technology become normal place look electric car around since nearly everybody think tesla created new concept
doesnt matter even complete trillion simulation hour still need training ever come india xd
find issue lidar heavily relies geofenced area helpful big geofenced city sure grand scheme thing visual approach like tesla vision might widespread application sure like fact one company trying different approach problem tho zero sum game multiple approach system tackle problem
im india approve message
absolutely made day
next teleportation
yes yes yes city autotonamy way safer im sire itll illegal come like dive manuel city
there side think video covered human bad driver human bad different way human driver flaw cause one accident flaw driverless system could cascade cause ton accident time affecting every vehicle fleet airplane industry partially deal one multiple software system designed independent team control plane human board override system needed autonomous car succeed need think sort issue
safety factor think solve heavy traffic car may market assistent system guide like propper time change lane take turn based trip lane stay based speed want think like
nope ill never let car drive im old fashioned car need person guy die ill always drive car im dead hope people run autonomous vehicle road would yelling car whole time telling need learn drive junk worth money invested
plus youre forgetting many car arent transportation tool car part family best friend way toaster never car never anything appliance american tied freedom getting road excitement one would ever ride motorcycle couldnt drive make sense car drive opposite lock pull drift correct underover steer apply brake get traction never good driver human
sound affordable
car stupid let make smart duh
think main concern driverless car would response situation dangerous reason traffic think natural disaster extreme weather shooting etc sure avoid many many death due human error wonder would react driverless car commonplace thing read news article saying people died driverless car drove area quickly flooding
sound like need autonomous pedestrian maybe would put mechanised exoskeleton venturing
getting car drive road within legal limit relatively easy getting deal human variable present much harder challenge think biggest challenge going coming decade getting people give right drive

memory people remotely watching car correct
dont like idea world thousand vehicle constantly flashing laser albeit invisible walk street trust human lowresolution camera pivot able make multiple highresolution camera system work regard think tesla right track
light used radar wich laser isnt different light used radio wave light see light camera might capture radar camera invisible light
raulfull use lidar radar long term exposure average traffic stop nm lidar could potentially cause eye damage known cause camera sensor damage dont know youre looking next thing know youve injured retina permanent damage rest life add cheap chinese replacement partsyou think wont around become popular temperature changeslasers change frequency different temperature water droplet refracting light wavelength recipe problem also idea wavelength might cause problem specie car probably problem car scary proposition
canadiannomad oh didnt know still dont get invisible laser cause retina dmg tho
raulfull brainiac great yt video demonstrating dangerous uvir laser
nice see brazilian leading team innovative company
driverless car would keep motorcyclist lot safer thats sure
actually advocate av plan banning non autonomous vehicle including motorcycle
actually elevator nyc still require operator buddy lived super old building one back high school awesome
im terrified seems another pointless addition society removing u life actual skill knowledge
exactly unlikely think choice need learner permit family drove washington state see mount st helen driving trip driving along columbia river lot people river family two adult couple kid dog leash crossing street ahead dog walking ahead family dog already lane family oncoming lane motorhome parking lot right choice go straight kill dog serve left wipe family swerve right crash motorhome dont think scenario unlikely think happened dog last second motorhome pulled forward able avoid hitting dog summer still remember like yesterday looking damn dog went pulled head back bit last saw rear view mirror family hugging dog middle road hope got leash though suppose dog must dead dog live year
car sudden stop good example think driverless car bad idea
really interested see well could work snowy weatherlike foot snow ground ice wind blowing snow everywhere dont know handle keeping sensor free covered driving different car responds differently ideal world every city snow would fleet selfdriving snowplow working nearly around clock keeping road clear efficiently crew trying best driverless plow could work together unit monitor road condition went
feel like matter car make choice difficult situation still saving life well would drive
im v curious get one like fully autonomous car rented purchase use lot energy added tech wait fully autonomous car
lost brother driver im alone hope driverless car come soon stop trusting human handle tonne machine
biggest reason want selfdriving car need pay subscription kind
lidar good tesla implementing waiting tesla auto drive
lidar expensive wearable part rotating mechanical thing tesla pushing idea camera
percentage autonomous car get higher safety become much better removing unpredictable human driver account
cup front cup holder
wendover video gave flashback forgot dull old sam
work want drive u thattt actually like driving rowing manual gear boxesthis nightmare take speeding list described speeding time europe autobohn problem described wreckless driving speeding combination traffic error
level worked extremely well th vehicle driverless urban area could fleet car rather personal vehicle thus reducing traffic volume someone hack system people faith system make break idea issue funding
live chandler hate thing need test somewhere else
stop dragging videao like minute content channel getting worse
video watched recently uni guy working driverless car claimed driverless car still poor heavy traffic situation
im super excited fully autonomous vehicle especially deal snow rain human drive condition think real problem one able afford
also increase street survaillance thousandfold like said car camera youre going harass someone rob youll immediately caught one single car passed cant wait fully autonomous car option get rid personal vehicle
area fully autonomous car going extremely hard since dirtgravel road turn mud rain driverless car learns drift dirt road prevent spin likely never one area also without stop sign intersection road day dont show google map also elevator scare crap
long acknowledging shouldnt building city around car first place sound good infrastructure shouldnt built around car people selfdriving car road bus
personally cant wait club cant wait autonomous car mandatory theyre already hundred time safer human driver even far better fully sober attentive human driver year problem regulation antitechnological hysteria
lost mandatory capscant wait singularity either brother
ill trust driverless car well human navigate snowy day road snow obstructing road paint poorlymaintained road dont want held back chance need go town moderately poor winter weather live made progress direction past year
cant wait tell future child control car hand foot simoutanously car powerd engine running flammable fluid exploding tiny amount thousand time per second
cop pull driverless car nobody inside meant shoot
wonder would cope older city layout le regular sightlines much restricted
probably require upload data city start working
id much prefer drive vehicle thanks
hacker attack occur sooner later think attack could devastating result since attacker might control great amount vehicle
expect longer legal human drive car public road sooner many people think personally think matter safety need happen soon possible purpose freedom people argue right drive still choose drive need deterrent law including severe penalty injury human driver cause accident causing death considered murder since driver chose drive knowing increased likelihood causing death accident causing injury probably considered attempted murder reason
dont see problem autonomous car drive suburban home shopping centre back within five year cant really see drive autonomous car around arc de triomphe far know autonomous car programmed wait doubt know many place pull wait whole day
many hole video biggest course fact paid advertisement sponsored company reviewing second technology year away general populace dont tell u absolute onslaught accident death involved driverless technology basically drunk driver behind wheel without pitfall personality third seen performance driving autonomous car far havent made yard without crashing basic driver finish lap nordschlif cant drive distance football field technology really stop posting video paid reviewing fully disclosed make employee youtuber cant believe k like make feel surrounded fool video unwatchable
ai making video youtubers unemployed driverless car would lay million people would devastating people would lose sense purpose understand people disability would benefit autonomous vehicle doubt banned commercial use period law place car become mainstream otherwise going lot unhappy unemployed people please dont tell find another job one day ai take people job select tech company run everything
car deal lot lidar vehicle area
honudes gai nah whrn another lidar beam hit car
different frequency
must averaging procedure time period number scan even regular light like driving sun people also see halo mirage understand vision real software cancel obstacle appears single shot middle nowhere disappears instantly however promising automation fully passive based regular camera widened ir range
im speculating seems certain information embedded lidar signal probably vaguely similar standard tv remote control system specifically encoded particular vehicle
thanks hard work recaptcha
interesting idea daniel suarez change agent people hijack autonomous car use sort public transport start blocking road ai cant carryon fear running car stopped attached external strap saddle non sensor obstructed anyone seated people blocking road leave autonomous car continues route im really interested todo situation
waymo car rail wanted convince people need show tesla
waymo good really ia wait tesla data collecting release fsd
youre telling walking pedestrian walked stationary car
want technology perfected faster trust human driver dont feel safe sitting car knowing driver prone mistake driver car road also make mistake mention road rage happens
hope car dont run window see suddenly stopping microsoft want software update
hesitancy driverless vehicle hilarious driverless traffic light driverless aircraft driverless elevator driverless railroad crossing driverless subway driverless conveyor belt driverless drawbridge driverless escalator driverless manufacturing people hesitant driverless anything sound like luddite th century
could see transitional thing car handle highway wake drive last mile
even watch video already drive better inside city transition technology availability eventual banning manual driving
statistic offer fatality way address question safety driverless vehicle never pool statistic driverless car eg equal number driverless car pulling driveway reverse know number fatality greater le driver occupied vehicle suspect fatality higher based solely established performance parameter driverless vehicle point never seen driverless vehicle even possible one followup show showing vehicle usual situation required daily basis pulling garage driveway reverse swerving miss neighbor ancient dog wanders haphazardly across street dodge duck waddled nowhere daily occurrence neighborhood managing parallel park without causing delay second driver suddenly changing destination there store youve meaning go like today changing destination rainstorm started want park closer destination right right normal daily situation fact happened single trip earlier today possible done safely driverless vehicle option
look like there k elevator driver thumbing video lol
think people essentially boil psychological issue blame responsibility understand implication there also second real issue privacy sure rational level know autonomous car safer end day theyre still made human human make mistake mistake cause car turn cause accident rare though may blame take responsibility human driver answer easy driver messed autonomous car doesnt driver passenger take responsibility manufacturer maybe government order protect shield manufacturer sure mostly problem two ear unlikely doesnt make easier solve quite contrary psychological problem usually hardest overcome exist beyond rationality privacy well tech company long since shown handle issue left unsupervised irresponsibly like supervision help much anyway cause look loophole usually successfully case car specifically known even manufacturer dumb car collecting selling telemetry car nowadays far limited data gathering capability autonomous car expected theyll continue autonomous car autonomous car conveniently packed brim ton data gathering facility true thats necessity doesnt prevent coopting data gathering capability purpose problem get solved satisfactorily count autonomous car win
privacy unneeded car
want carless road
jane yo check vid soon make brainless pedestrian cross
car braking hard reacting like guy cart dangerous would reacted like doubt tech long way reason camera lidar radar goodness know else realy cant react made interesting pointscheers
problem autocars autoautos would need called country issue technology issue right insurance blame collision programmer manufacturer owner insurance
could walkable city streetcar suburb make car really useful incredibly long distance travel okay
human car chaos monkey autonomous system dont get distracted dont get impaired dont get road rage subject bad judgement around speed condition dont drive boost protect ego cant come fast enough
future insurance cost want drive wreck youre driving could sued criminal recklessness turned robot driver
gps required correct
car make decision whether kill passenger child
really really need soon possible would save many life
really need taxiuber strike thing take lol
best part driver seatbelt fasttened
put total recallairplane style driver puppet driver seat
difficult take anything say sponsored video trustworthy assume youre likely fair even public statement practice taking sponsorship increasing frequency sponsored video making wary say video real shame since skill explaining complex topic
wonder much consideration put scaling issue example many car close proximity lidar running would interfere
thats exact question im sure look info
hmm lidar sorta like laser pointer rotating mirror think would little interference
able set lidar specific bandwidth light possibley multiple car one area adjust bandwidth tracking accordingly
light set various wavelength also lidar one controller many combine data tell apart
lidar use spinning laser thin light beam chance theyd align actually pretty small vehicle would serveral real issue guess could try tweak frequency bit
always veritassium feel like he running advert company help make video basically one sided argumentation great autonomous car might reality seem great doubt drawback nothing upside downside
dont think experience necessarily equates skill though ai need way data human train
may need data need many time people forgotten traffic sign mean necessarily skill safety
useless numberwe x hour trainingdata mean nothing result bad fillerphrase hide problem still facing
would extremely interested see believe would help many people gain trust vehicle exactly react emergency unexpected situation crazy driver cut brake close deer jump front car unexpected object fall road whatever many small situation could happen anytime think situation scare people would react unexpected situation
bunch benefit implementing driverless vehicle current technology limited implementing somewhere road maintenance lacking congestion suffocating road safety absent nearly impossible thats need people making split second decision comparing driverless car aviation autopilot system like comparing highschool scribble mona lisa aviation regulated supervised way travel failsafes redundancy built avoid collision accident plus year training certification needed pilot first place compare week driving around abandoned parking lot get license cruising around wide wellmaintained road minimal congestion level driving possible moment
cant wait till car electric selfdriving reduction noise pollution pollutant parking space time saved driving reduction accident death cost insurance improvement traffic flow car sure operate smoothlythat make city much livable yes done gradually safely safe environment like city try putting self driving car street india disoriented traffic people bicycle coming different direction would unable move new regulation worldwide adoption probably including evicting human driver road people behave nicely wont blocking traffic flow unnecessarily
develop drive successfully traffic condition found india talking
driverless car cool definitely upgrade also talking commute wasted time car mostly stand around public transport solution wellbuilt public transport infrastructure definitely upgrade better solution already course driverless car accessible people disability theyre le accessible people cant afford car first place im excited driverless car hope least bulk peopl move away car altogether least city
kairi katalina isnt experience fact car stand around time take huge amount valuable space city true normal car electric car driverless car inefficient car infrastructure make city le walkeable bikeable two mode transport better environment efficient city outside citites bus train work much efficiently building type transport would way better banking driverless car save space resource essence driverless car may way better usual car problem carpart car general inefficient
fully autonomous bus
im software tester serious doubt industry code deployment process given movefastandbreakthings mindset ideological hatred regulator especially true tesla waymo make software change tested virtually real street deployed vehicle frequently update made regulation company willing accept ensure catastrophic bug dont make onto street million mile realworld driving minimal accident great many iteration software cover critically weather conditionstraffic densityroadmapetc scenario test cover starting arizona theyve chosen friendliest possible environment many challenge lay ahead hate driving agree people horrendous driver torn wheel soon practicable im deeply skeptical industry ability deliver maintain lifesaving threatening code easy enough short term incredibly difficult long term team get bored problem solved highskilled engineer want run work something new management start squeezing development team le faster order boost margin etc strong regulation slows thing add cost save life long run
rang wife warn take care heard radio lunatic driving road us get work wrong side road replied isnt one
mean also take bus
well waymos car snow gravel road work usa right could handle different color road marking driving left
imposible better average would mean bad apple propably true
think people voted driverless car wont ready year meant wont mainstream year
solution tradeoff applies driving safety well true selfdriving car cant make human error mistake state tradedoff different systematic error distraction rulebreaking get traded sensor failure uncaught corner case software overall personally think tradeoff indeed result fewer total fatality dereks streamlining nuance strengthen case understandable making case derek implies automated driving safe vulnerable anecdotal counterexample eg tesla failure detect white semitruck plain daylight way automated driving set fatal error smaller human driver doesnt even le succinct
human error example brought also show situation classified human error also result poor systemdesign example arterial road connected driveway designed enforce keeping speed mph eg traffic calming would fewer fatality automation designer motto human error ever result task design first place seminal machine design text design everyday thing excellent exposition chapter titled human error bad design
legally driver license due vision would game changer thing available affordable
personally driving freedom unfortunately autonomous vehicle cant provide kind freedom
long live drive million mile put mile pickup time driving twenty year im well year old honest
nah thanks dont like dystopian future megacorps monitor control everywhere go
think problem isnt people underestimate power technology put much faith driving realize mention handing wheel someone else whether computer another person make feel helpless control make feel like nothing prevent crash arent one driving
hi great video comparing problem driverless car autopilot air plane even elevator really hide away fact hard problem misconception human always image recognition consortium problem hard solve plane radar position practically mathimatically well defined environment
problem driverless car try solve due car driver car inherently wasteful use ton device move hundred kg people know reduce accident traffic road proper urban planning allow easy access without using car
happens car come road navigate snowy icy gravel dirt road happen human used driving want get somewhere robot car cant drive seems like good idea big city tho
rn go road clear map set input constantly developed hopefully thing relatively near future
awesome sad people like driving purpose make commute little bit longer driving im going miss era real car
well detect obscured stop sign
ok agree u told driverless technology big concern concern majority people trusted used frequently jobless driver find job across world lead homeless depression psychological effect etc may lead increase suicide crime etc
there also big industry equipping normal car self driving tech
worried poor driver something else
drive around see crazy stuff people support driverless vehicle tech still reservation still like take motorcycle every get point every vehicle autonomous street light control traffic wont able drive anything
feel like rush driverless car blinding people need reduce amount car better public transportation
driverless public transportation driverless carpools always option
typical techie solution put band aid say revolutionary grew recently though seem losing narcissism instead establishing new hegemony silicone valley new anymore
thats idea better public transportation unlike bus get last mile next plague come along self sterilize instead stuffing everyone moving disease spreader
driverless bus essentially lot ev seat van peak time following regular route opportunity hail bus anywhere route phone bus stop number bus point time would driven number hail request along historic data excess bus could wait anywhere along route wouldnt need get driver back base
ensures driverless vehicle properly maintained fleet probably ok wont stay solvent privately owned vehicle
point car drive
id call technology mature autonomous vehicle drive indian city expire le pedestrian ie would better human driver
theyre definitely better stage wondering curiosity unhackable car system wouldnt hacking like human influence way dangerous
assumption internal hardware unchangeable unless set location like shop would upload experience download necessary programming malware could detected individually
anonymous interesting thanks
im automated driving public transit commute minute oneway work work full time driverless car thats least hour week likely youre working engaged thats lot time could spent something else
need wheelchair ramp van waymo braunability vmiyou watching
concern stupid human expect another human something stupid computer might
close half people aware technology existed dont economic geographical mean use least year
elevator v tightly packed freeway ok lol
way would become safer ride without helmet hahaha made statement
thats consequence overthinking unlikely cenarios
im fully autonomous vehicle think safer already human driver talking data machine learning algorithm v human experience stretch dont think simple way comparison like rewiring caterpillar brain car make experience driving learns drive safely huge amount data compensates fact caterpillar brain even think know driving may thing cant learn due architecture brain
natural evolution car becoming boring soulless appliance normies disabled use want want drive couldnt care le negligible safety improvement im going let machine live life
human driver become even aggressive know driverless car automatically yield risky maneuver
cool uneasy potential data potentially collect
glad derek criticized ethic self driving problem really didnt go far enough absurdly unrealistic scenario relevance real driving start false premise human make ethical decision middle traffic incident dont accident happen way way fast part brain involved moral decision make driving choose drive recklessly bored angry everyone
car self driving would never traffic anymore crash time productive much
driver industry would die bad world need progress
think want people change long time sell idea people dont drive car get somewhere sort reason people car never convince owner classic muscle car replace something like car he thinking safety ease cost green space handicapped people anything classic make himher feel already car road right could retro fit autonomous system minimal cost benefit would immediate huge people wouldnt die traffic accident every year traffic would run efficiently saving fuel lowering emission building whole bunch new car save resource cover different reason people car hence smoother transition stop calling driverless magic driver p love channel bro
awesome want get b im minority though thoroughly enjoys driving
dont think youre minority driving fun picture enjoying driving mind eye fun drive winding road somewhere bumper bumper commute car primarily designed replace commute fun drive
addition disabled blind people unlicensed people young get license get around car would great year old kid could take car
problem driverless car one day someone named keith buy one keith type guy think service car
car smart stop keith put jail anyone get hurt
ha good one mabye ai would think broke tire something ideally refuse move handling isnt right
bad exactly people selfservice car computer time theyre literally designed easily swappable part plus autonomous vehicle could easily calibrate newly installed sensor detect faulty installation centralizing repair autonomous vehicle would ironically lower human autonomy since rely third party repair property pay large markup service
areadenial wouldnt car would like taxi cant swap anything autonomous car
tafazziondiscord original comment state bad keith decides buy one yes would shouldnt keith allowed repair property
also really dont like idea never car belongs like always renting service possible abuse private company strong monopoly fleet technology
personally would use driveless car citiestowns kmh max even id rather drive
may able see better still better pattern recognition
wish youtube something like video veritasium
hmmm dislike
wish google button like commercial dont watch horrible im particularly self driving vehicle probably ad far beyond rule would warrant immediate ban month two im usually rather big veratasium fan even though ive always hated nasty plug beyond low whole video dedicated partner camouflaged information stop please
really enjoyed video made think technology headed
replace driving system automatic car even better make street compatible autonomous car even better create shared transport vehicle provide sufficient privacy people transported smart enough combine travel people way optimise time travel guarantee security privacy reduce impact transport emission
work heavy rain
knew actually want u work commute
work commute work long take bus longer driving overall need gone le losing commute time
train airplane ship much easier problem automate yet none anywhere near driverless kind transportation dont expect see driverless car operated large scale time soon
everything great till brought plane im autonomous car there problem could emergency stop anywhere likely road cant plane yet pilot needed least next year climate change might get u
dont think people hesitant think better driver think placing life hand nonhuman decision maker like everything else folk eventually accept going take time long would say depends rate accident significant injury fatality regardless vehicle fault even autonomous car everything right expect news present repeatedly highly amplified drama added effect chance autonomous car stopped stuck behind traffic light get annihilated behind loaded dump truck failed brake major network news broadcast would concerned expert furrowed brow suggest autonomous car could saved life passenger pushed way onto empty sidewalk avoid impending collision
dont know personal liberty come cost tend value liberty highly great tech protect personal liberty personal liberty scientifically measurable progress technology making sure politician protect personal liberty policymaking im behind

let honest social credit score low youll shadow banned car also since le vehicle number remember sit time concept middleclass person travelling privacy government think low electricity ok critical service personell allowed go ominous overtone given dramatic governmental overreach seeing gone fulladopter terrified luddite
hm car radiating laser drive two identical car riding beside
people driverless car selfish dont care anyones safety
get id still always want ability take control vehicle one reason like riding motorcycle otherwise automate anything dangerous let u sit chair like people walle
car road speaking one another pretty much traffic accident occur today disappear
feel veritasium dismisses moral issue quickly talking ethic selfdriving car talking specific dilemma selfdriving car would give company lifeanddeath responsibility unprecedented scale yes utilitarian benefit may enormous look software bug cause crash company responsible potential death
shown much safer human insurance company screw anyone driving normal car
dont want service take job away people spilling commercial industry
absolutely true plane carry passenger fly without human pilot good reason come man make good video without telling lie entire part misleading frankly lost confidence
didnt say anything plane pilot said plane flown extensively computer doesnt mean dont pilot mean pilot dont fly plane constantly
zippybobo video driverless car something think bad idea talking plane flying computer context important may intentionally mean plane fly without pilot certainly many people take statement one important difficult part pilot job making decision true car constantly making choice drive car right dont crash wrong thing might get bent
damn editor hated tesla video
people injured must least twice number
really cool cant wait figure driverless car work bad weather
figure make people drive well bad weather let know
wow weird see neighborhood veritasium video
take money
people terrible driver please let computer take control
im interested simulation car speed limit road sign ignored
happens there two vehicle lidar close mess distance estimation
derek explains autonomous car general thinking however current waymo approach future fully autonomous vehicle scale viable use high fidelity map environment break every time roadworks storm etc service available geofenced area map built real system performance new area unknown top rain snow degrades lidar performance lot service also weather condition dependent generalized pure vision approach openpilot tesla seems correct approach
parent aging im idly waiting technology become commonplace id love get one vehicle feel confident arent going get car accident mother always poor night vision kind autonomous vehicle would game changer
grandparent getting quite old dont react quickly used would also love widespread
take parent live place functional public transportation

creepiest thing autonomous vehicle must monitor passenger health start deliver dead body currently someone dy behind wheel car crash
amanda yo check vid also commute car could whatever want time using public transport without dealing people
autonomous car dont emotion people driver technical part driving already brought well enough state thus logical solution implement fast possible area good road infrastructure course
autonomous car kill someone blame company people react son got killed automatic car sueing company make said company loose bit money interesting thing think
yes would company thats liable
hope human controlling vehicle banned near future
one impressive thing predict potential outcome computer thinking ahead like really difficult id love give one try
see identical car used horse racing kinda like chicken fight roomba
actually autonomous indy car race coming soon identical car pretty cool see

nicoassaf sound interesting
danielfay ill keep eye
autoland function plane function radio localizers runway video really gloss lot important fact
yes prove point machine automate complex task reliably harsh condition doesnt matter instruction executed internal external
agreeing statement made believe autonomous driving wont end cheaper compared uber taxi maybe ever eg see tesla charge per month fsd service car sharing service end bit expensive would like least europe market company find way extract money pocket
many problem mentioned end video could solved good public transportation self driving car olddisabledblind people use public transport readsleepwatch movie going work public transport public transport also lot saver per person transported driving car dont get wrong would absolutely use selfdriving car would available good public transportation especially city defenitely better solution switching selfdriving car especially environmental standpoint
think understated reasoning behind automation complete abolishment traffic
think people overlook beneficial car elderly affirm vulnerable people otherwise drive

absolutely mindblowing
im
even driving normal car still trusting technology trust gas pedal wont get stuck brake havent gone bad wouldnt say fidgeting around seat find something checking phone second putting makeup trusting technology much people already driving normally anything newer version car automation would make smaller task mentioned slightly safer especially wouldnt need balance steering wheel knee would define trusting technology much thing like sleeping unless someone car watch everything watching movie something like take steering wheel
itd nice company backing selfdriving car would prioritize public transit given bus already set route follow driverless car wouldnt necessarily decrease reliance fossil fuel expansion customizable public transit highercapacity option would im honestly surprised dont trial run bus driver supervisor level partially autonomous vehicle

feel weird like scifi movie real life
feel like self driving car wont widely available year problem theyre damn expensive reason average person working today economy cant afford one maybe later line year manufacturing driverless car become widely available road many car company switching driverless car see year cheapest driverless car average person afford tesla model made hopefully well see le fewer manual car road

im interested greater ethical economical implication assuming driverless car expensive number year still need insurance doubtful since there driver lay blame poorer people still pay driven car still buy insurance city decides driverless car much safer driven car used city street thats likely happen driverless car proven much safer currently cant legally drive car road dont meet certain guideline safety reason poor cant afford said new driverless car first many year existence

scary thing isnt autonomous vehicle one day driving car manually likely illegal
human wont needed
parent imagine saying waymo app take kid soccer practice field stop mall passenger asks stop
kid push emergency stop button near mall
im sure friend look today
tyler would notice help desk sure nobody responds help desk start talking emergency service called
honestly would love go soccer field mall
frank ive thought imagine app alert parent immediately case unanticipated detour excessive delay app notify parent car arrives destination would use year old id definitely use year old
one many reason google stock never sell
really cant wait self driving standard issue thing theyre expected vehicle road longer drive see needed may fall category think higher driving may ive always considered decent driver though certainly nowhere near best im stunt driver get older tell im getting worse reaction time slowing couple feel like people road never even looked driver test much le taken one many people driving night without turning light lack signal blatantly ignoring sign rampant traffic weaving get one whole car ahead list go easy see actively improve thing suppose well really need reasonably priced way upgrading existing vehicle become autonomous though sadly seems le likely thing happen anytime soon
logic also need hour able differentiate cat dog accuracy rate think youre bit
driverless car cant account weather condition road surface inexperienced human cant either thats many accident weather condition
isi eager technology
ironically think whats holding back general adoption driverless car least point view think driver good know bad driver would feel safer car road automated others werent least others car would behave predictably course exceptionconcern hacking autonomous vehicle causing erratic dangerous behavior maliciously
hopefully soon illegal take wheel
video feel shelly
technology awesome computer blue screen flashlight quits working errrrrr
love hate preempted argument thousand u indian would make badly maintained road insane driving right beginning

im surprised people think theyre good driver im pretty sure number bad driver ehh good driver ai cant flood market soon enough
id never want fully driverless vehicle id love self driving road trip enjoy fun vehicle would like able drive fun want dont live city worry traffic ive decided dont want driverless vehicle become adapted people longer vehicle transportation taxi style im
feel first person self driving car passenger answer ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh go cliff
human slow change yes there whole industry one job built around driving impact people like truck driver position sort evolution going see
like elevator people pee
self driving car cant let go driving car fun
thanks derek future coming
still many year everyone fully autonomous car primarily life span car range way year taken care used drive year old vehicle retired someone else hit road totaled purely well taken care people like often time go area wood ai simply couldnt either road arent mapped logging truck forestry machinery drive recklessly said though would love vehicle turn feature let drive place city without ever needing focus road also let take control situation either need something ai cant trained xing etc feel like want feel road im strange person genuinely enjoy act driving outside city country road highway etc
average rarely good statistic average american family net worth median way half american family le average
wait till terrorist hack main system use car weapon also work africa worked company automated large warehouse system sabotaged time staff unhappy computer would take job
lidar look ugly jeez
giving control see someone sidewalk passed want take wallet say stop car
make terrifying may take away joy driving normal car banned future
great video think something people think implication traffic traffic caused difference pacing vehicle exacerbated human error car going speed space making decision traffic improve exponentially
problem isnt driver driverless car problem car slavish expensive nation destroying utter obsession strongtowns notjustbikes
tested europe road size similar vary much usa would cool see fare
know accident waymo involved human driver think human fault statistic accident actually waymo v waymo hope know mean literally accident statistic something derek good vid hope see soon also eu
arent statistic car never made mistake like
thousand issue really could give le damn k luxury garbage nerd
thats thing cheap accessible form taxisuber
start scoffing half people thought year away end waymo aiming big city five year rural area bad road marking bad road condition bad weather condition etc year optimistic
one many reason stopped driving uberlyft love idea driverless vehicle especially industrial vehicle however im definitely screwed regarding work income nothing thats ok though im essential life existence earth forth perfectly happy sit
one cant wait people turned idiot road thing allow live inside self serving bubble without putting rest u daily danger
cant wait try experience wish city
nice waymo actual autonomous car system based virtual trolley preprogrammed path inside highdefinition lidar map car trying keep preprogrammed path static environment watch irregularity particularly moving waymo capable driving outside preprogrammed path network thats need geofenced enter new location special reconnaissance team create detailed map area possible path technically waymo siting somewhat boring rollercoaster go point track cant force car leave track
someone miraculously survived falling asleep narrow country road surrounded nothing wheeler cant wait see way mo
iswydt
driving narcolepsy need ai assist pronto
narrow country road surrounded nothing wheeler sound implausible going say absolute certainty lying nice day
kratosdisciple im sorry perspective limited absolute certainty placed easily falsehood
kratosdisciple damn didnt know narcolepsy specifically driving rumble strip wake cause thats saved
even though number sound crazy good ie million mile impressive comparable human would need become good driver today state art algorithm like artificial neural network require many time training example get human level performace take imagenet one popular widely used data set object recognition task contains million image thousand different object image per object average think moment take hunders image object ai recognise properly hand human require example learn object look like another reason number given video dont carry much useful information demonstrated video synthetic data brought clearly see example usually differ slightly ie car cm left position original sequence dont get wrong kind sythetic data important current algorithm improve performace comparable human experience taken grain salt
le bad driving compilation
video showcase positive side driverless vehicle also negative side technology older get stop saying told one day innovator gon na find position question ethic action im sure inevitable driverless car future worth future either enjoy cry fruit labor
cant wait till self driving car use vision expense stuff
lidar v tesla type system work differently huge cost difference happens snow heavy rain road marked map common commuter trip ok weather sure bit condition
pas
public transit priority private autonomous transportation train already safer cheaper greener
cant beautiful ballet intersection still people choose drive remove parking lot there still people driving plan allow people drive anymore
tesla finish fsd within next couple year waymo scale like tesla myriad reason tesla projecting produce million car per year already million road collecting data real world driven mile infinitely valuable simulated one due real world edge case waymos geofenced whereas tesla work everywhere cost produce tesla k v waymo sensor suite running k plus electric v gas clearly transitioning sustainable future waymo wont significant part
ive got two real problem autonomous vehicle computer dont perfect better people isnt difficult seems problem one road know mentioned beginning grew driving road marking would computer handle outside major metropolitan area road maintenance rapidly fall place others seems like people stand gain autonomous vehicle people already access thing like public transit two question liability obviously autonomous vehicle much le prone accident human driver still happen say otherwise simply isnt realistic god forbid someone injured one accident fault owner driverless car held responsible company sell people wrote code current system designed understanding someone always blame upon inspection problem problem idea autonomous vehicle implementation system designed hopefully someone smarter working
absolutely love driving like meditation apart odd occasion might like driven interested however mean replacing absolute idiot road dont look changing lane dont indicate tailgate generally behave like moron sure could useful
imagine car get pulled get ticket driving car back seat
comment split
cant wait make robot everything would sweet sleeping late
one thing wonder work dont know exactly youre going sometimes youre trying find place youve long time ago youre exploring tiny rural road find nice place forest autonomous vehicle
tech ready moron base identity self worth around driving car cultural conservative want take advantage drum vote without delivering real policy outcome arent
clearly fake john cena driving car
tell youre millennial without telling youre millennial derek elevator driver generation elevator operator
dont trust driverless vehicle around human driven car
dont trust human driven car general
love invention need next step mobility itll safer also allow efficient traffic le jam autonomous car also prevent collision animal would great
ofc avoids stationarymoving object already
owning car hell automated car service want get b worry parking insurance maintenance
owning house also hell wouldnt trade apartment people prefer apartment good im saying theyre wrong dread idea outright banning driving one self people terrible
full self driving never work unless road specifically designed built well complete adoption car communicate opinion
people making car prove ai prioritizes life others ill never trust car problem car company would make car prioritizes life owner life school bus child there big difference deciding sacrifice life avoid school bus child whatever arbitrary value code monkey writes ai life value
driver car well made shot debunked
nice drive selfautonomous car airport make drive home
thats called public transit
faubertmaxime privately owned thats beauty go anywhere never worry parking
faubertmaxime basically taxi without taxi driver
imagine car hitting walk car there one inside
scenario receive text soon land saying car got accident think responsible accident caused car
driverless carthat still requirers hd map full team engineer watching live ill take current tesla anyday
extremely unlikely scenario multiplied million man hour drivingwalkingbiking solve problem occur cant say car wont solve problem driverless car youre probably see
emergency vehicle approaching move officer side road light going perform temporary work zone like flaggers using stop slow paddle popup traffic light construction work bridge
matter time say ever let human drive car
problem autonomous car car view time driving car would definitely take option letting computer drive driving time bad driver constantly edge anxious parking absolute nightmare stress anymore would great
question cost ride driverless vehicle per mile zone one pay im assuming via cc want stay vehicle go different location let say reserved ride grandma house way call say shes still aunt bettys house want go
went phoenix ride one waymo selfdriving carswith kid see actually car seat inside every car ive ride twice night day around min ride sense cautious driver put safety first time always obeys speed limit doesnt change lane unless necessary polite car road polite pedestrian became available city issue using send kid school
thought replace every single nyc taxi certainly dont feel safe one sisterinlaw paralyzed could definitely use one isnt tesla pairing waymo put technology car video autonomous mode tesla ending crash readily available seems like nobrainer put car already mostly autonomous finally happens motor one lidar laser spinner go car compensation
want see car performs street manhattan pm
would probably fine better human sure human cant really pay attention one thing time car literally watch everything around thing perfect city im dubious car outside city road line often poorly maintained arent lot reference point also course rain snow
autonomous car still useful car useful eg mountain road
love car sticker wheel tell keep hand
self driving car way desirable use use around crappy human preferable general machine role
could easily accomplished computer dr strangelove
scary thing report turkish drone supposedly allowed find engage target known
lagging
sense phrase car intentionally worded rider fully responsible car accident
haha case waymo would responsible bad driving car reason say sometimes eg bad weather human driver driver seat theyd rather tell drive begin
autonomous car nice actually need road right le car alternative bike public transit train fancier car come later
isnt biased technology thinking human best operator vehicle airplane capitalism eeking much profit possible saving labour im luddite think pretty soon job redundant artificial intelligence taking incredibly inequal society bottom rung living miserable life poverty want well paying job whole concept driverless car unethical context
screw car want teleportation car primitive
stop trying get computer prevent human racking darwin award
unless invent entertainment ai
thing challenging take vehicle operating u road rule let drive say uk road rule different road different mainly much narrower etc human driver actually better u
th video pog
must use autonomous car instead bus taxi
self driving must allowed proc perfect u shouldnt forget human side think making life changing even like killing human person normal one ofc think could damage life u killed someone incidentally would punished law ur self inner emotion big price person pay live entire life robot dong dont give f code u write doesnt matter dont wont ever road killing robot intentionally shouldnt autonomous hand must proc safe never exist road people first
like idea autonomous driving much disadvantage bigger make want stray away autonomous driving normal government sooner later going make mandatory take joy driving person would like drive want drive big driving unsafe part town someone stand front car carjack rob worse car come stop best lose car possession worst case life could go isnt safe realiable reason want full control car would self driving car entire life would legit already diedrobbedcarjacked twice want drive away bad weather debris road etc get safety wont possible selfdriving car become norm scare
hear better public transportation like train bus better funded
one people voted selfdriving car year away reason say cant build machine obeys rule road cant yet rely sensor data consistently work anywhere isnt clear weather year round live part canada get easily foot snow time temperature c road sign lane division car sensor covered snow like there way im going trust car actually know road let alone properly handle traction loss ice car would useful month year thats simply got enough yet
would wished get input waymo v tesla comparision camerasonly based system v lidar camera
yeah want driverless car either john road fix end crashing cause repair matter minor astronomical cost go via main dealer world stupidest idea let go back tram want bull
commenting liking spread video algorithm awarenessless suffering
want see one test drive rain snow fog night
night would definitely significantly safer human great night vision technology scanning environment doesnt use sunlight anything wouldnt know difference day night would work poor condition like snow rain im curious let forget human also much worse driving condition
whole video felt infomercial lot fact provided sponsor many negative left minimized imagine route preplanned well known affair video different tester showed white van following autonomous car around van got stuck middle road cone side human would kept going easily support tried restart car remotely time human showed drove autonomous car away live several mile outside small town main road hardly line last five mile house unmarked road line sign reflector tall grass would give turn without enough clue guide car getting ok major area nice new host asks one point something like good average driver right sponsor chick dodge question like professional think know getting good replaces stupid drive distracted twat driver one car good replace skilled attentive human driver
happens someone cut traffic would liked see
everyone used self driving car would essentially like train network guess well reinvent train future
veritasium really want reduce traffic provide better alternative form transport thinking safe car zip around like ballet anything like dumb remove human driver road anyway thats end goal use train giving overly expensive vehicle person ridiculous notion living car dependent city whole life really want people unable drive well get around better solution already exists keeping expectation people need rent car get around add major financial barrier anyone trying get around train improved isolated individual better thing like bike reintroduced society cover people travel le mile day le car wont need waste mile mile space cement landscape parking lot people able rely thing like train bike bus leave road really need use like large truck shipment people actually traveling significant distance idea everyone depend car daily commute really cause traffic prioritization car make viable option mean stand people physical financial need assistance currently getting screwed continue screwed path continue tack path u incorrectly taken imagine world isnt car infested wheelchair user use small low speed vehicle make daily commute like bike user instead fear road car incompetent people could serious infrastructure bike user pedestrian separate car cause live genuinely great lifestyle getting around want within mile great place like already exist netherlands implemented right away hoping human transition fully automated vehicle road actually ridiculous would take decade fastest incredibly inefficient form public transport one point machine driving thats public transport people dont want think public transport associate word impoverished think public transport user beneath driver think way society decided society doesnt fund form transport nearly much car thing continue way billion billion continue wasted create society could easily created already using train bike bus road semitrucks encouraging people use option owning car owning driving car shouldnt ticket able live decent life society btw poorly checked rant able figure researching alternative learning successful transportation netherlands compared car dependent place world society perfect transport could exist instead focusing carcentric idealism thats probably life time away come many hurdle cant even think right
man nobody know drive would nice car automated
hi derek love video quick question waymo able operate place hasnt operated example say new york city waymo mapped phoenix help drive phoenix
really convinced one another outstanding video
strongly support driverless vehicle safety however feel machine may yet able predict thing human example month ago driving extremely poorly maintained road resulted vehicle shaking bumping around somewhat near rushhour traffic vehicle directly infront pulling rickety abouttofallapart piece lawn equipment behind trailer observed situation course one two mile felt nervous left much greater following distance typically would gut told excessive bump broke rear mechanism trailer giant iron grate fell came front vehicle thanks following distance able completely avoid prevent damage vehicle well would selfdriving vehicle respond circumstance require experience ass situation driving make decision like thanks making video presenting technology despite concern excited see develops
hey derek beginning video youre surprised large part viewer think technology year away thing technology year away mean many thing either tech yet invented tech exists take time spread personally think autonomous car least year away im aware technology exists today im also certain get use anytime soon im denmark copenhagen multiple thing need happen use car politics autonomous car currently legal denmark unless driver behind wheel mention beginning video could prove dangerous person suspect getting take least year never know enough data denmark need gathered im suspecting already lvl car im sure company need put car denmark car park need change big one even car legal ready denmark purchasable people need stop buying driverfilled car start relying communal autonomous private autonomous car change mindset change pov need time happen technology might start spreading denmark soon year think fair say currently still year away probably le year taxi completely phased sorry rant didnt like albeit le rude term called large point viewerbase ignorant current state autonomous driving beginning video phrasing question ambiguous
make another video cruise another selfdriving car company
great video cant wait manual car cant driven public road
driverless car solve exactly car accident traffic jam quality life seems perpetuates potentially increase problem created first place le reliance car primary mean transportation individual wouldnt fewer accident wouldnt need value something wouldnt buy first place space available pedestrian green space rather parking lot road wouldnt quality life increase would downside cheaper car transportation eg decrease life quality people working around industry car road meet increasing demand lower profit margin increase inequality access public infrastructure already marginalised population etc problem driverless car attempt solve framing issue regarding question trust machine also false issue trust directly indirectly machine every day one issue trust subverted people behind machine oh human handle highlevel ambiguity without need huge training data set drive explore act unexpected neverexperiencedbefore place situation pretty decent success rate find meaning anecdotally bunch thing let stop questionable human v machine dichotomy
yes people preform task like said end curve concerning say human driver proficient driving automated car would presumably driving skill external distraction also human inconsistent day youre bound tired influence unable see due weather automated car dont issue preform peak performance time
anonymous agreed unless unless nondriverless car traffic circulation mix likely happen presumably long time driverless car make mistake misinterpretation especially come predicting human behavior oh wait human everywhere street city neighbourhood
kevinrichardch yes mistake consistent constantly updated year technology around weve simulated driven billion mile going increase time go point technology constantly improving whereas human really dont personal experience autonomous vehicle share experience receive information million car well car past
anonymous huge data set give good sense significant behavior limited access weak signal detection whats needed adapting unexpected debate make sense assume driverless car good solution whats presented video questionable original comment pointed anyway thanks exchange
biggest problem selfdriving car still many human driven car long there still human driving mix cant fully trust automation selfdriving car itd amazing even need semaphore crossroad assuming car manufacturer agreed crosscar communication protocol
anyone think human good driver havent spent enough time traffic

waymo cool scaleable current approach map every area perfect detail car drive sensor arent practical outside research expensive complicated car wouldnt good learning behave naturally handle edge case waymo would need data ai game significantly hope real autonomy scaleable without limitation next year tesla big data win race also cheap approach camera
interesting informative video always derek believe say hope see driverless road sooner rather later yet still nag back mind watching video moral dilemma section le glossed indeed thankfully hopefully imaginary scenario unlikely happen still need discussed suspect probable answer scenario dont know systemalgorithm would know situation happens question becomes would human comfortable trusting safety something fully understand know science channel philosophy channel think discussion important especially lawmaker le scientificoriented population actually people decides whether technology adopted hope see follow video discussing question
autonomous car interesting dont think much technologyhardware problem software people biggest issue far confident self driving car surrounded self driving car split would make nervous
everyone keep making people think theyre average type comment say learn difference median arithmetic mean people average number arm
sentence hurt brain ima think anymore lol
car autonomous need driver license
arent rn hopefully soon wont need em
question steering wheel actually give input rotates purely cosmetic override shouldnt need rotate fine
still physically attached steering rack
always pick nun orphan must preserved cost
hitting orphan would second worst thing happened
inevitable air bus travel plus allelectric reason live cost mile taxi personally cant wait till job
autonomous driving make commuting travelling cheaper owner
driving anxiously overthinking dont hit anything autonomous car overthinking
car think parrell universe ahead
avatardchiken couldnt fail disagree le
yeah man u human give stress poor robot need paid therapy session poor robot take care problem also overthinking
least hit driver would injured
impressed curious would handle pulling fully loaded large trailer difficult overland terrain
driver datamiles going back improving software done zoom
would reinforced machine learning work source youtube algorithm etc
potto done zoom would waste us software staying version
though fully supportive autonomous vehicle research well implementation continue think still need work developing public transportation dont understand need individual need vehicle transport yes understand fleet autonomous car meet high efficiency power raw material etc think city could benefit greatly good mass transit system
lmao first title driverless car already
channel supposed science advertisement discussing greater context fact half energy electrical car spent producing car science say increasing road capacity solve traffic problem comparing self driving car safety safety train collective mean transportation
one thing think people dont consider autonomous vehicle get exponentially safe le human road imagine every single car road knowing everything via lidar sensor also every car broadcasting status every car network
live mn knowledge little testing done winter driving condition soyeah year least
challenge self driving car drive india highway damn sure hypothesis fail near even trained decade
worthy note fact waymo car require street drive premapped waymo vehicle using tech likely limited specific area foreseeable future driverless technology limitation similar greater level development video sponsored company make car demonstrated
got license type car really intrigue id love sit back one road would feel much safer
ikr
driverless car great authoritarian ruler deciding access ride credit much
spooky
hearing conversation end help think simply using public transport used thing way university albeit u system established scalable sustainable car cheap honestly idea still waste time driverless car point instead improving public transport system
id like add isnt useful city living rural area hard get around without driving car uber doesnt get traction cab autonomous service didnt pay human driver would godsend think would gain traction quickly right advertising strategy shuttling multiple kid different activity mile apart putting truck ditch driving home christmas party dd
imagine human driver even exactly thing esp momentarily distracted eye contact pedestrian car software predict human behaviour one thing always better one thing enough make u better driver anymore still real solution commute
loved video derek couldnt help notice seemed tired car eye bit baggy
fervently advocate motion sickness reason turning signal audible
know wont first one use autonomous car never use first second generation commercial technology
excited oldest got license likely last generation lean drive
kinda bummed selled hard basically cheered whole time like single critic technology potential risk discussed didnt bring liability concern go detail yet another technology white suburbanite also breaking news company internal report say move along nothing see
nonwhite people perfected
cant find valuable evidence support casepoint view may time rethink point view liability concern company likely fully covered insurance wise event accident showed stats crash happened time system running driver fault critic ive almost rear ended tboned head week alone due careless driver phone need change happen getting driving mile prove technology love driving need happen get sell crap ive follow company little small independent youtuber record ride amazing car capable ill link channel find
flackconnon fact dont see liability issue prof read topic show arizona state law blame assessed event malfunction driverless vehicle malfunction due coding error liability rest coder employer employer wave gross liability event faulty code often diver testimony critical factor feedback code carry weight driver testimony show statute every state address issue agree issue look forward seeing state statue linked
lidar receives light another lidar
autocars introduce accident course current accident would reduced distracted driver speeding drunk etc billion accident would introduced autocars cant identify work simple thing human oneeye closed like autocar lurched stop shopper pushing cart next laughable terrifying simple thing autocars cant understand never turned algorithm teenage programmer
mercedes benz invented self driving vehicle
really hope later ond video say waymo able function area mapped extremely detailed waymo drive everywhere road well please correct knowledge outdated
actually enjoy driving understand driver road cant really drive well wonder robot safer average think stupid average person remember half people stupider thats need autonomous car dont mean want one also tf stop button pull button thats intuitive lol
would like see autonomous car handle driving outside arizona especially northern state snow freeze winter month thats solved id back autonomous car
big bummer autonomy using gasoline thats slippery slope
really easy devise battery challenging test require completely different location done even mentioned anything would raise confidence like x immediately
honestly stuff like keep making wonder even worth get driver license wait selfdriving car become common place
id say get bored u could take lol
im logical however automobile industry fight hard stated dramatically smaller amount vehicle needed government also fight due lost revenue stream license ticket union fight due loss job autoworkers go work good luck
ig could go making moderating diverless car work maintaining still need replace thing like oil tire battery etc
think ballet driving refer could thing human emphasized importance expertise driving fact people get distracted theyre driving part problem imo
pretty sure technology great problem show consumer hand miss using technology create problem
decent condition think selfdriving car viable bad condition poorly maintained road without lane marking construction site unusual lane shift heavy snow block sensor still wouldnt trust like elevator there one way go airplane there extremely welldefined marking abundance sensor plane use car need data readily available sensor need robust wintry condition there question making affordable think need average car price u theyre going make meaningful impact market otherwise going struggle get past early adoption phase given think least decade something thats ready marketed consumer another decade affordable mass wouldnt surprised see humandriven car banned though
need develop public transport train theyre safe technological discussion political
thought smarter haha im going see real smarter guy think
seems fairly clear huge change coming however stochastic reality yet recognized road filled vehicle one reality many significant vehicle need mass transit human change mind want go uncertainty human choice limiting factor someone break bottle street immediately deflating tire one passing car situation rapidly accelerate stochastic chaosespecially people broke bottle pranking people passing dangerous manner guess im saying social prescription going need change technology truly effective think arises uglier anyone imagine great video however thanks
need million km able confidently say better average human death per million km norway one safest country cant use law large number phenomenon rare
million mile safe awesome job x youre good go however different calculation could justify waymos claim safer average extrapolating accident accident expected within million km accident death rate around expected death rate would ppl norway netherlands average country far safer u far better driving education safer road infrastructure
look handy also want backup car zero electronics could list reason theyre hard figure id keep going wall text
prediction adoption autonomous car year insurance company handle risk assessment show statistically cheaper insure autonomous car car driven human drive cost insurance car drive policy law regulation required get road market decide wide spread adoption happens
cool
want better public transit better city better car city
stop video sponsor put incredibly naive filter dont dive actual potential issue talk liable autonomous vehicle crash talk potential driverless grid give ride time corresponding much pay talk pulled driverless cop car talk number people who primary income involves driving lose job im sick good youtubers selling advertising product video
biggest hurdle acceptance going traffic ticket city make revenue car actually follow traffic rule
lol ye
mashine learning scary imagine simulate multiple lifespan experience couple month memory data stay
great video derek love care improving world
problem human v ai controlled car problem destabilizing climate v using bike public transportation
wow never thought driverless car really could get rid parking lot would go far distance fight climate change another plus
would think police court would hate ticket pay bill thered never another ticket duo real problem see cleanliness human gross haha
great content derek ive always enjoyed content way make watchable youve improved ten fold year
dont know youd wan na drive car ai could could chill
people enjoy act driving legitimately enjoy driving
spencerdiniz ok buddy
im half minute youre using anecdotal evidence pilot error someone could easily bring time pilot saved people like scully landed river computer assistance case automation commercial use need person manning station car plane boat
ai tendency stop sign possible accident problem like happened like need hard stop slow yes guess similar thing happened cyclist car full stop unexpectedly cyclist couldnt react accident happened moving somebody hit doesnt make automatically right
aint gon na happen sae vehicle limited intercity highway travel freight transport truck wont thing city daily use there way ai able react literally countless variation thing could happen let alone fast enough prevent problem havent seen video tesla plowing thought stoplight driving behind truck carrying stoplight
crash accident word accident implies event unavoidable almost certainly fault someone action
cant wait save time driving something productive feel like biggest waste whole day
need side mirror car
car ballet thing look scary normal autonomous car traffic
bash daddy musk anything waymo seems concerned safety tesla
main concern driverless car norm always idiot take advantage good avoiding crash eg someone might fake like theyre going step curb make driverless car slam brake potentially cause accident people worst always people actively trying cause issue
collision incident waymo mini van collision rear passenger side contact made vehicle passenger side conceivable incident could explained pedestrian cyclist predicting movement car therefore aiming car going car saw direction travel predicted collision stopped arguably caused collision mention one three youtube channel id say love derek admire im passionate science technology video make giddy lol edit
waymo vehicle didnt stop response pedestrian already stationary walkedrode vehicle moving
tonypcoyle confirm ran police car twice scooter parking lot suv completely stationary time asked lady move car slightly different area watch violation never happened felt bad even though fault run primary reason simply paying attention didnt happen time secondary reason car stationary somewhere shouldnt stationary second suspect happened waymo car people expect car always moving parking lot arent parking space car stationary choke point good regardless
tonypcoyle fair enough ill feel awfully foolish speed data leading collision video lol
livetype fair enough youre argument would waymo stop awkwardly long time least sometimes thats like every driver road reason demonize vehicle agree thats argument mean
justicew vehicle programmer
think excellent planned route easy pull go drivethru get last minute burger ice cream
prob easy would assume
cant wait available around florida even rent starting would useful dont drive always terrified much
self driving ubers would great wouldnt need pay driver bit gas maintenance lol
anonymous exactly electric gas cost low maintenance could make tailored individual travel much cheaper le frustrating public transit
kineticsymphony make wonder dont see car everywhere lol
better option would public transportation cheaper accessible people
useri actually would many case expensive time consuming driverless car go exactly point b without stopping people case driverless taxi would pay price fuel maintenance like said
car need iron dome safety average driver
move fast lane someone approaching behind dont want
told add green space city reduce fatality reduce climate effect make everyone healthier happier right simply getting rid car replacing public transportation first reaction would never work specific reason need examine told personal car smart dumb electric ice way think need
exactly havent already watch bike channel
dont like driverless car would feel lot safer driving metropolitan city live suburban area rather metropolitan city ive seen many people speeding highway road incoming outgoing traffic suburban city max road highway road single way rather loop high road crossing top safer option lower speed mph mph metropolitan area way driver enough time think driver safer faster instead causing unintentional traffic stop middle highway course safer option never happen
allow driverless car preserving childrens ombilical cord treat first degree familly stemcells becomes standard practice south korea iran west using progress depopulation concentration wealth f
long driving becomes illegal year sooner
lol
enjoy driving hate bein taxi etc driverless car
well self driving car far lea idiot run
favor value safety passenger anyone else choice required made way designed would get one tomorrow
take car key cold dead finger never ride car driven unfeeling robot also keeping manual transmission kind car make despot drool
waymo rider
thing scare get older driving complacency happens take route consistently get comfortable filter data come feel creates worse driver rather better one situation challenge u often force u attention time know number people driver license cant handle situation panicemergency going far know one black hard braking see driver aid autonomous car wonderful thing time much love driving know case everyone many purely mean transportation care little obeying rule attention required correctly operate vehicle many state recognize transport tool primarily continue give license people danger road due hardship need transport fear day longer drive vehicle anymore wish huge source enjoyment year track
im surprised able get shot seems sticking camera anywhere line sight autonomy would risky thing able roll window mount roof either way im surprised system allowed
rip cash cab
one thing competition start company autonomous highly doubt wont kind distraction car development rather social welfare autonomous car great hope doesnt lead u disaster
noticed weather really nice sunny snow slippery condition
derek one vortex boundary layer water oil preferably oil close viscosity water science girl pool surface demonstrating semicircular vortex created would interesting see start full circle vortex like smoke ring progress must change viscosity different vigo mortensens voice say
seems like would bad environment parking would mean lot empty car driving around looking parking outside city
driverless car screaming government going able control travel free citizen
problem lidar going several unit vicinity whose beam going overlap affect image receive
hey derek familiar hidden issue lidar highpowered uv laser damage camera sensor
people saying wait till try driving local road severely underestimating absolutely buckwild dangerous driving phoenix area get snowbird show winter collide often literally valley mass driver think getting anywhere time trial competition
american anything avoid public transit
driverless car great way reduce accident emission traffic jam however big brother easily deny access transportation dissenting opinion also dont think would completely supplant self driven car sector mainly farming forestry mining industry largely road motorsports another sector wouldnt involved
little bit question autonomous vehicle fair sub optimal condition example heavy fog heavy rain could reduce visibility even show could reduce visibility cover line road car adapt unwritten rule road think possible long think tech away example last winter got lot snow one day highway really bad people started forming single file line driving like mph presumably middle two lane though hard tell line would car able adapt unforeseen situation creator could anticipate theoretically infinite odd situation car could put know able actually think problem solve rather fitting situation cookie cutter situation edit kinda mentioned stuff video guess waited post comment p
lidar use infrared go thru fog rainiirc work night visible light system might able provide good info human eye fail car vision system know exactly sense map recognizes street etc end gps know recall returning home passed thru really heavy fog speed barely kmh stretch km passed heavy wheeler going kmh driver seemed know road last millimeter followed truck without loosing make think car know road detail lidar help see something ahead autonomous car able something human safer different plane landing heavy fog
car shared experience million mile driving let sink
worst happen know pull safe place
tesla fsd beta already dirt road heavy rain snow construction etc nowhere near perfect yet easy see becoming better human short time
think ethic question nuanced make even corner case would ethic determined software team dont trust make ethical decision
know shouldnt couldnt help laugh people ran stationary vehicle
stop calling vehicle collision accident term brought field automobile company oops couldnt help running pedestrian autonomous car choosing hit thats definition accident quite clearly chose hit thing purpose
thanks another great video covering important science issue
even lofty goal maddening
wanted driveless car road like year ago said even someone long alphabet feel little weird veritasium commissioned video like
car sitting garage huge wasted asset previous video mentioned emission created manufacture wed need manufacture significantly fewer car used time
vehicle way experience see
risk software laser camera microphone hacked snooped upon mean safeguard safety privacy risk
would assume car would necessary programming internally manipulated update individually road like maintenance something time could checked sign unwanted tampering
one people think theyre better average driver also feel average driver dumb use fork eat cereal people werent stupid behind wheel id average best likely since drive fast
see issue driverless car sociopoitical problem technological one derek pointed oft quoted trolley problem someone case automous vehicle choose person hit true occasion might happen practicably negligible compared number human error accident would avoided human singly moreso group terrible thinking like first time occurred would widespread misunderstanding situation followed condemnation multiple individual quickly exploited selfinterest group driverless car happen west least need grow society covid taught u anything going difficult adolescence
really want see like extensive showcase big messy city new orleans denver also interesting thought average work day could cut however long cumulative commute time work hour day commute total hour could spend commute working thus office hour word gaining back commute time put use spend amount time office spend commute time leisurely stuff people family friend might really appreciate extra hour home hundred hour year thousand hour lifetime
fatal flaw concept resolving human error self driving car code prone human error witnessed tesla malfunction drive concrete pillar parking garage bet thats worst happen almost paradoxical try fix human error human error agree potential need embarrassed still shouldnt rely argument much human make error thing making code also quick side note imagine someone hacked car man thatd suck
would love driverless car long could go somewhere aside track drive around there something super relaxing driving highway even fully alert
weird hard stop unlike human probably doesnt look gazelook direction facial expression
thanks info great
search google danger automated car snow ice patch liability road condition ie pothole construction hydroplaning blocked corner road debris sensor malfunction software heatcold number accident avoided human part design metric etc etc toy people want feel like jetsons cost
problem vision end world autonomous vehicle relies every vehicle road autonomous even vehicle purely practical purpose urban area autonomous nonautonomous car arent completely going anywhere anytime soon lot people like driving form recreation long human unpredictability system cant work like maybe day either wait quite concept driving fun disappear generation else force people abandon ability drive would obviously good
awesome video cam use
derek follow usage part world kind weather sunny beautiful day like driving snow ice raining little lot fog night dawn wind etc wonder vehicule work good weather know plane work kind weather car
driverless car become way common human get banned driving unsafe
would call situation motorcycle extremely unlikely even would remain relevant depends frame reference next year maybe next definitely relevant
lot driving like everyday absolutely good amount people good driver im largely autonomous care love driving owningmodifying car think detrimental also like able get car time drive anywhere amount time essential shared car would ruin also getting ride one everyday month destination gasinsurancecar payment im essentially like car ownership full self driving get place drive ie racetrack im realistically feel future slim none unfortunately
also im probably exception rule way thinking case oh well
accident fault usually hear person driver fault hit autonomous car car make mistake study edit never mind answered
excited autonomous car want ride badly stress disorder driving really stressful prefer someone else drive hey ber driver outside car
think consumer use car available small group specific people
autocars able drive ruralbackless used road mostly driving main road data back road
appear good perfect condition like arizona california michigan cant see road snow reflection rain make line nearly impossible see interesting future sure
actually sparked another thought idea human better ruling human wrong
grandad risk stroke cant drive sad doesnt want rely people u cant drive u got ta someone else he worst situation look family people condition cant drive one look sad self driving car amazing
keep human filth fleet car ie people vomit poop pee dump garbage graffiti destroy etc
world fully automatic car would zero traffic change mind
building incredible lifestyle top poverty bottom brilliant plan
would car know whether trying get stranger
tech
resident test area phoenix east valley ridden driven behind seem safe however smooth make jerking steering correction sudden hard braking sometimes apparent reason one pay close attention driving behind one hey safe smooth later
want self driving car bad hate driving
could troll friend placing speaker playing siren block house
im afraid autonomous vehicle get weird edge case figured
think there good chance daughter never drive vehicle
move wendover production
wow cant wait till thing consumer grade would love automatic car
driverless vehicules huge adoption pollution follow electric car
love idea autonomous driving car one question target cyber attack could attack shut whole city transportation system
think huge difference driverless car automated elevator airplane autopilot drunk idiot elevatorsplanes near
cool way reduce traffic reducing car making autonomous aka public transport autonomous
become economically feasible end day product unless government step bridge gap
want one cant drive
go mph autobahn though
yesyour little robot car drive fine world real people detect going scale
nope autonomous vehicle may better rare extreme case child walk behind car struggle common everyday event like rain snow viewing blank side wheeler featureless concrete barrier navigating construction zone street marking need ignored flashing sign override example poorly maintained road road identifying animal jumping road even determining human response like bicyclist walking across street case autocar crash often fatally human would easily navigate course human fall asleep told pay attention minimally something driving car skill constant vigilance required driver suggesting vigilance reduced recipe disaster yeah autocar might perform better rare extreme example human crash id rather one control common everyday encounter autocar fails
wonder deal human direction uncommon driving come across worker often folk making delivery put cone road casually directing traffic one lane even road wave nod driver understand direction make decision trustworthy course many edge case one driver need kind two way communication another driver actor seem particularly confounding clear really want self driving car wonder isnt one problem solving last percent take time solving everything else
id prefer develop mass transit instead would first stop making isolated suburban area everywhere start developing way daily commuter car isnt needed first place
pedestrian id appriciate kind signal car tell car seen know stop
people average driver really really really bad cant median driver
driverless car bad idea never come fruition
work vehicle motor enthusiast would entertaining watch human ai race f happens dirt bike quad f trailer happens gangster realize stop autonomous vehicle rob person good inside question want people answer agree city circumstance surrounding civilian transportation autonomous car much safer better general public thing want hear discussion
sponsored google
wait driverless car abuse arises mean know ai avoid accident dont
car handle situation road work human directing traffic know proceed director wave
security driverless car hacking
would know car around future horse gone maybe car road take space business
cant wait become reality feel much like elevator example itll take huge event like fuel price skyrocketing need apply new driver permit drive legally around autonomous vehicle huge game changer see widespread adoption tech pointed driverless car great think react perfectly textbook problem thrown however equally system given human deal stupid driver etc unpredictability lead autonomous vehicle put nowin situation sound edgy human problem theyre removed situation never going utopia traffic seamless intersection glory sadly think going take extraordinary circumstance get majority driverless vehicle road id love unbiased sponsoredpaid video reviewing earth actually integrate tech short longterm
insurance company hate
problem already solution make commuting safer cheaper accessible efficient theyre called train dont get wrong love traveling car get much stuff daily commuting even shiny new autonomous vehicle cant solve problem car centric society
there lot technology work well enough good condition live get snow due road line arent well maintained mention road condition general think autonomous driving good necessary come yes think technology ready widespread adoption sure might work pheonix happens someone decides take autonomous car trip place like live people already trusting autonomous car enough sleep behind wheel would really drive condition thats something im willing take risk
american dont want commute work anymore would love sit backseat work way way back something fun watch movie sleep yeah rest world thats public transportation decade
exactly self driving car neat wont fix problem need fix way design city suburb make sure pedestrian cyclist friendly fix public transportation pretty sure would half amount car road
haha know joke defense population density way different say uk eu japan china india etc public transit doesnt make nearly much sense except place like nyc san fr etc car would viable
thought exactly car loud wasteful inefficient plus rubber tire asphalt around year isnt time innovation going keep around personal vehicle perhaps aircushion hovercraft could next step theyre efficient smooth surface linear induction motor could run strip metal center road propulsion lane centering even full autonomy could built start
ok sure american infrastructure car bus awful city wide spread sometimes missing sidewalk railway system rare want get somewhere besides largest city car
actionalligator population density designed way though netherlands didnt solve traffic problem accident designed better city car arent going solve traffic problem problem created government decided build making awful decision
safety im confident selfdriving car safer barrier success see reliability failure mode likely car stop handle construction flagger indicating traffic flow maneuver lane stalled car front think selfdriving car must sort remote control human im curious often need engaged
id okay autonomous car car street autonomous autonomous car dont trust reaction might people driven vehicle
sharon yo check vid there quite large jump autonomous sentient cyberpunk still drive middle human driven vehicle
title change
recon car long remain unavoidable low population density place nice keep improving city plan must le car urban planing public transportation walkability phoenix arizona need mixeduse zoning
car prevalent reduction traffic immense many area traffic really exists human element
also exists poor infrastructure design self driving car wont make rush hour traffic go away example many city space housing commerce far requiring everyone drive car time get work back additionally full adoption selfdriving vehicle traffic flow still limited slow response time human driver still road
areadenial raise great point infrastructure rush hour highway traffic decrease greatly innercity commerce definitely still struggle peak hour
would like imagine future sustainable public transportation system act artery society forming primary transportation grid autonomous vehicle would serve capillary fill gap
image video change
im watching video right friend nearly got whole squad killed assumed incoming crosstraffic stopsign lucky stopped time driver responsive swervedslowed time id rather place trust automated car lol
change driver teach friend pay attention
millenniumhistorytech wow thats enlightening didnt think already
driving history realized drive chance taken point people patient cause wreck kind chance self driving automobile make night year old hit laying across lane moment dont think would want trust self driving automobile would self driving automobile able know child laying road even dark would think child piece trash one time riding bicycle quite road nothing block vision could see yard young child playing ball close house child kicked ball headed towards road glance knew car behind signaled stop turned bike sideways block car ball rolled parked car child right behind wonder one self driving automobile could noticed driver behind realized close came hitting child

miss payment repossess lol dude wheres car
one emp done
perfect road condition rest world terrible road idiot driver
never realised strange people see driverless car freak
ive doubt driverless car generally safer fill dread using car long period time since also likely engineered planned obsolescence
thought presumably widespread adoption technology would severely impact automaker bottom line expect manufacturer active discouraging widespread adoption lobbying disinformation campaign anything keep money flowing
wouldnt matter never car likely car remain pay per ride business model case planned obsolescence wouldnt affect
talked reducing traffic parking lot got really excited discouraging much u pavement would love see reduction car culture enjoy thing
driverless car arent necessarily going change everyone rush hour start using driverless car service car still end parked somewhere also take one trip europe see doesnt take driverless car le carfocused culture
want hurry f get commute nah time smash brother traffic nah ill nap drive la time binge watch netflix

fun driving
case scenario people cant wait fully autonomous car replace car require driver youre stuck traffic jam highway see rearview mirror semi quickly approaching back sign slowing second two move car way steering wheel hand foot pedal would selfdriving car pull road save life situation natural disaster happening area live road full debris youre trying escape selfautonomous car refusing go countless obstacle road doesnt manual control driven car youre doomed group people violent behavioral intention blocking way selfdriving car youre car prioritize life
im dubious scalability lidar realise speed light gap individual ping unlikely two car lidar system interfere dozen car sharing stretch road easily imagine clash starting occur alarming frequenc birthday paradox style
probability individual light particle colliding fired case likely astronomical even would little effect considering sends million per second
like idea selfdriving vehicle feel like great solution carcentric view used even proposal like one seem extremely fragile one thing going wrong could ruin everything additionally system like wouldnt pedestrian friendly would love see technology eventually applied public transport feel objective
omg left chemtrail machine lol
world need le car light rail public transportation
first youre kidding think lead freedom havent noticed world plunging deeper deeper fascist lockdown dictatorship youre also living fantasy world think technology lead affordable transportation vehicle software fantastically expensive way youll able utilize rent infamous saying goesyoull nothing happy upon time support technology big tech absolutely spiraled control taken meaning power drunk whole new level think wont even able summon one vehicle residence unless government approves reason wanting leave home knowthe pod want live eating bug

love someone else drive would say much driver error driver carelessness willingness take risk driving
whilst impressive cant help notice bestcase scenario us carcentric infrastructure wide road little obstruction city weather always good
want bike
hey huge fan tech general completely get safety come tech fun part driver driving car speeding enjoying stuff let know wrong
thats personally think tech suitable disabled elderly saying would neat lot car adopted tech like warns incoming obstacle pedestrian road hazard car sensor would helpful especially let get distracted road lot
really one blame really misleading accident could prevented taking human equation design road intersection major contributor likely human error actually cause accident recommend video car dont crash building netherlands channel bike
maybe united state would reality rest world idk
bad prefer manual driver guilty pleasure live high speed chase thats bad isnt
reason pilot front passenger know there someone responsible flight even mean monitoring computer somebody might pay life fail
darek yes autonomous car drastically reduce number road accident subsequent fatality always ethical question autonomous system kind even one accident occurs bcoz bug tech much possible bug big tech like autonomous car would happen case would take responsibility incident developer company take responsibility think know corporates ignore incidence saying le number ethically correct question one life lost bcoz computer bug question delivering justice one life think main issue stand driverless car autonomous system
excited driverless car mainstream love waymo tesla two completely different approach interesting see grow
never imagined software driving thing would shared trained real life also simulation thats serious training
work ai general simulation supervised learning tedious expensive simulate scenario
public transport thing maybe u tho
please integrate tech pontiak firebird know mean
car fully autonomous doesnt mean decides taking want go shop bad going movie want watch day thunder
im interested know lidar would interfere driverless car popular
shouldnt sending radar ping wont interfere radar ping next
potto lidar isnt radio pulse though visible spectrum light beam refractive surface like fog shown reduce lidar range like vision
short answer need see multiple situation one waymo vehicle around passing direction opposite parked way stop etc create interference detailed explanation radar time returning pulse know expect therefore ignore outside logical range even simply average noise since many quickly
andyfma em radiation radio visible light made boson occupy quantum state therefore problem physical location passing right
well radar interfere one another normally different frequency little side band interference thats also due one area lidar problem would likely depend many source wavelength use use identifying coding imbedded beam
video shill nonsense lmao every single one driverless car vids sponsored

replace regular car driverless car soon possible still dont solve inherent problem car awful city people car wheter electric selfdriving levitating still require city landscape massacred make place type car ever sustainable scale

tesla b mile real world driven data
happens system hacked million young people suddenly behind wheel zero driving experience system hacked matter
would purpose hacking also would assume internal hardware still control completely without connection central place
anonymous purpose terrorism damaging people case driverless car true way control manually case failure least bring safe stop case people without experience thats easy
agree comment hacked whatever reason specific situation would actually really dangerous however may happen manual car example cut brake car damage way hard control even driving experience thats really dangerous situation
ivanbattiston id say people would hack much airplane would also assume would multiple fail safe prevention method car need manipulated driving tweaksupdates would applied individually car would best guess

hmm think think might work india traffic would better everyone autonomous car people think autonomous car wouldnt work india due indian traffic drove way indian driver dont think would bad job
like dont want pay monthly fee car fully paid buy tesla get paying continuous software development rather car software fully developed run perfectlysafely software ship till life car require update otherwise ill drive
autonomous vehicle definitely better human driver still dont trust two sharing road im certain either incompetence malice human driver cause plenty crash autonomous car make believe technology ready fact either lack trust lack resource willing witch yet side huge part world road hardly made properly maintained make road unusable
believe video selling product conversation autonomous vehicle safety every point feel like coming waymo pr team
want want work small back road even gravel dont imagine thats huge hurdle accumulated experience seems mainly city freeway highway id also like know manage heavy snowfall side wind seeing see visible spectrum probably capable dealing better human extensively tested condition doesnt decide hit brake there cm wind formed snow wall
lety babe
still feel weird like cant wrap head around would react weird scenario like driving require improvising feel like ai couldnt following preestablished routine time probably would fine still hard get trust
thats cool great concept nah
thats good sale pitch issue isnt safety reliability relying computer bad idea automated elevator issue whether refusing let refusing let simply taking wrong floor thing happen could software encountered edge case wasnt programmed maybe elevator simply didnt seat properly door got stuck human operator would know give jiggle try computer would know wait second everyone disembark move dont mind riding automated elevator regardless potential issue getting stuck elevator inconvenience worst health safety relied elevator getting right floor every time id never ride thing automated car safer human driver absolutely trust nope

still dont understand average people think better purpose build machine mean come entire existence one job constantly think better get real
driverless car v weather car cant see camera lidar got snowed mean driverless car place sunny mild weather
happens self driving automobile get older thing start failing point thing wear automobile removed use united state america long history bad act
exactly thats oppose level automation car far fully automatic vehicle give driver false sense security overly rely dont problem much full auto presumably able respond crisis able drive first place still would trust computer handle emergency least vehicle commonplace greater assurance work effectively situation theory there reason shouldnt work
next step driverless electric car
driverless car surely great innovation prevent thousand death help many people however solution traffic public transportation far best way reduce traffic city thing like subway train bus tram handle many people create little traffic compared car hey make autonomous american especially think term car get ridiculous idea elons vega loop capacity compared normal subway laughable best pathetic worst course there still place get car metropolitan area need good public transportation want get rid traffic
long lidar also would happen car using lidar beside eachother
argument funny pilot highly skilled trained ppl average driver since got high tech instr aid self driving car youi put video airporth highest grade landing system long install even main highway road cont tracking radar plane fly pilot monitoring intervene anytime much self driving airplane
elon said hate lidar unfortunate thing autonomous vehicle killing people situation driver would never reacted better wont matter autonomous vehicle blamed
think derek sponsored waymo make feel like promotional video selfdriving car educational one

would afraid autonomous car human better driver human worse driver human unpredictable absolute hazard
video feel extremely onesided drawback fully autonomous vehicle struggling right im sure plenty issue since still alpha beta stage decade development biggest company world
far im aware cost high cheaper use taxi dont want one driving
well video sponsored car company im surprised didnt mention drawback
point steering wheel designed scratch like little one
love video man always optimistic make people look forward brighter future grim one im ever arizona im trying doesnt come sooner
still stick manual transmission car enjoy last year experiencing joy driving guess price self driving car way low time shift

agree hacking car concern autonomous even nonautonomous car software control think read gm outfitting car software system police remotely pull car mind matter time software system vulnerable unethical actor blackmail malware increasing recent year blackmail control car sound terrifying however im sure fo free open source software prerequisite safety far know existing airplane autonomous piloting elevator system fo generally assumed safe regardless freedom gnu definition freeasinfreedom mandate freedom modify software system widely adopted think waymo car running homebrew homemade software would increase risk homebrew system glitch driver around homebrew car cant tell custom system respond accordingly absolutely need audit autonomous car system test make sure theyre safe mass adoption free freedom seems like increased risk
mattmerr pacemaker device also laughably easy hack yet far nobody done despite fearmongering around bottom line villaintier crime average person isnt interested sort person skill hack car going software developer earn large stable income vast majority hacker white hat hacker actively look flaw may inform owner security vulnerability receive reward statistically speaking youre likely beaten death husbandwife thats interesting enough write paragraph fear porn
drive india car fail move inch
driverless car mean dead people show destination dont want deal tell car go morgue
reason lety cavalcante kept talking whether passenger trust car like passenger quickly forget driverless car important derek said people make mistake also make mistake trusting car
hope one day able tell kid used drive car theyll go
old silvester stallone movie one taco bell become fancy restaurant demolition man drive mustang n nobody else know drive also still dont know use sea shell replacing toilet paper
thinking day im old man people hear saying used fill gas tank manualtransmission nonautonomous vehicle
wait isnt pokemon video
manual transmission
ontariotrafficman witnessed dad get car going manual crank battery died feel old
driverless car great public transit still way better
open door waymo im sorry derek im afraid cant
waymo
upgrade vibe
waymo aka hal
doesnt enough like
street odyssey
cat iii system refered need plane align system along runaway ground done pilota one align plane without system make contact plane automated landingi know still remember part air crash investigation episode
would driverless car work nonideal situation eg nontar roadsforestry bad weather id like know developing country could benefit even subpar road infrastructure
wouldnt lidar sensor interfiere lot self driving car
tammy yo check vid idk probably stop like
tammy yo check vidwe go bee movie style work right traffic let car go around u
b way get level autonomy car need constantly communicate achieve total coordination
fear driverless future protection hacking ddos government competing company hacked big self driving company control least hundred thousand car use weapon ruin company reputation large scale hacking increasing someone malicious control thousand kg vehicle would devastating
snow wouldnt cover lidar sensor
remembers westworld scene driverless car big nope
youre johnny cab
different approach safer road let build continentallylarge country using carcentered urban design making huge loud systematically dangerous road city even economically environmentally sustainable create huge profitable solution problem weve created b dutch design safe friendly road saying technological improvement arent great cool driver one blame road safety shittydesigned road
autonomous vehicle shiny expensive solution problem wich public transit could fixed decade ago
cn youre right thats post city planned car usage huge suburb mega mall walkability youre interested bad check video real life city planner youtube urban doctor come mind
sorry like idea giving someone able drive getting ability like idea freedom taken away especially tech giant deciding see internet dont want also deciding drive let say authoritarian government saying cant go place enforce car safety angle work worth giving accept risk driving scared world remote work home delivery stay home
people may average bottom really bad plausible yeah thats actually fine
want driverless car indian road ambition kill
oh yay driverless car cool accident time low news week later autonomous car manufacturer brick multiple vehicle update single letter mistake
one release update without rigorous testing
garymfoak quite true many low impact cheap software company littletono testing update minimum amount testing directly scale liability yeah car company hundred billion dollar liability hanging head would test everything thoroughly
garymfoak heard microsoft google yet
falleithani yep one meant competent tech company
gandhiphysique yeah em
ive seen point several time like downtown az one thing there lot weather interference seattle laser distorted rain snowice snow ground cause car get confused texas freak ice storm power week imagine vehicle electric dont worry gas longer trip understand biggest concern people scenario rarely come come happens ice pretty easy deal drive slow treat brake like bomb go much pressure robot handle without worrying hackersterrorists trying hijack taxi get car take nap arrive airport airport random road got gun face youre kidnapped secure network hired white hat find potentially fatal flaw security
security huge issue autonomous vehicle consider also privacy issue company already know u online theyre also going know go even dont use phone gps whats stop company paying car service company take different store asked go real world version sponsored search result arent relevant searched
yeah agree theseotherproblems one im concerned really dont want car becoming like phone forced update always connected samsung account use device tired agreeing term surveillanceoops meant service cause thats self driving software service dont buy software buy ticket use itso car truly mine whatever want maybe self driving demolition derby maybe want repair upgrade car allowed sued service terminated
robot handle definitely every mechanical action make robot make better hackersterrorist get uber take nap wake gun head story autonomous car lack telemetry inconsistency intended route would warrant speedy reaction law enforcement yes design even hardcore hypothetical would end fearmongering let try one get uber driver knock unlocks phone fingerprint cancel ride whatever without supervision
megadwarf perfect amount braking computer emulate meant say lolif human stop red light robot stop red light everything difference gon na say robot better think human biased towards computer cause newest thing help u greatly
imagine trying get away someone eg murderer put siren make car stop
carry gun
yep government probably illegalize possession recording siren car something like emergency escape button ignores siren stuff like zoom straight police stationcar
escaping murderer calling cab key scenario youre concerned live new jersey detroit
kamoto faking emergency siren already extremely illegal there plausible scenario problem selfdriving car isnt another option effective humandriven vehicle
falleithani see well ops scenario ever happen real life though would make interesting scene action movie reckon
rly hope change design car alongside automated driver imagine car effectively small room whatevs enter easily entering room important thing disabled folk able driven road
driverless car might future gon na common quite average age car country year old trending halt technology first serious accident first death due technology significant push back police department lessen revenue raising security risk personal national widespread automation political special interest group aswell personally even statistically safer wish trust fully car industry continually fails ground safety think airbags development started modern design reached mid yet million vehicle recalled explosive takata airbags first seatbelt patent yet gm recall model could light car fire recent ford recall activating crash alot people like driving also funny side couple mate came milestone wan na see first person wake mile wrong direction car started going null island first person fall car continue destination first car run gas without occupant first car robbery standin front car pay em move first person driven directly police station car first autonomous car police chase
someone disability cant wait driverless car
someone without disability wait driverless car glitch run spine
palm sweating watching back seat
grandma second husband died month ago absent mindedly pulled infront semi car elderly would save countless life would much easier solution trying take grandma license extent freedom away
aeroplane automatic controlled environment car deal irresponsible driver many factor
theyre neat ultimately would like see public transit lessen dependence car kind
public transit system made fully autonomous vehicle train
way public transportation car self driving point come pick drive way destination leave dont one call service would hopefully result complete reduction car ownership car would become publicprivate transportation service door door delivery instead get station first arriving one well
public transport vehicle drop pick nearest person super efficient
agree said thinking tired feel like typing much thank expounding
rudybleeker sadly doesnt work good imagine everyone get work time time car parking using space
im really looking forward seeing pretty funny autonomous car travel road even inch snow know people designing super smart figure might allowed roam street winter canada
got ta love science channel shill billionaire technology fundamentally garbage
snow
lot blemish autonomous car there always human error perfect utopian world would top notch road maintenance full autonomous vehicle ecosystem still get high sun condition camera cant adjusted fast enough many thing human avoid interpret different way professional driver know scenario people dangerous av isnt answer make road safer
three contact could fault vehicle even stopped cross road example dont wait vehicle completely passed anticipte movement vehicle would stopped abruptly im getting closer think itll continue move like vehicle human would collide im still convinced theyre better human theyll add accident wouldnt happened human
drive miata physically see everything time
id rather robust public transport tbh
like cool cool self driving car safer whatnot train bus like dont mess around know work reason dont politician would sell infrastructure make quick buck
tesla past waymo tech without using bulky expensive lidar look fugly thing scalable
please give one
ad interesting ad though
im think ready
wow really gon na shame sam showing video old hasnt even developed emotion human speech pattern yet
would rather real driver say someone crashed person would consequence robot crashed doubt multi billionaire owns company car would probably get away
trust selfdriving car algorithm dont trust object recognition tesla doesnt use lidar rely mainly camera thats dont trust ai make choice still predictable trick object recognition software changing pixel dont trust lidar much reliable tell object way without use ai would trust selfdriving car machine learning used something critical like deciding front wall also im italy take still many year autonomous car able drive around historical city center without road line weird road cross people still struggling understanding go case
team tesla convert autonomous car run solar power situation car run energy middrive would run hydrogen
called elevator operator driver cant misconstrue nomenclature fit agenda
airplane also much regulation car going willing multiply price pay car time make sure safely automated part plan make car unaffordable live congested city take taxi rather owning one
overall great video look forward car become commonplace id like see discussion car hacked passenger inside thought
im surprised even word begin end esla pronounced praise actually quite opposite fact promoting technology reduced amount sensor relying visual cue actual messy software today twitter shown model interpreting moon yellow light
anything teach computer eventually learn better human
purposely purchased tesla full self driving capability since im getting older let say driving skill arent improving even tesla current beta fsd feature kept much safer road driving without extra layer assistance additionally ive never enjoyed driving despite driving life im looking forward full level selfdriving
willingly dont driver license bcuz kno wud get overloaded driving horrid eventually got used thus overloaded unnoticed also prone way driver get distracted get accident drive even ignoring much higher likelihood another driver distraction cause get accident first tryin get license horrible parental figure driving instructor one first time went drive didnt even get driveway hitting tree anxious nervous moment got worse yet even nervous likely drunk day drinker nvr didnt least one steel reserve giant beer tryin grill everything im tryin remember sensory overload kicked overdrive cudnt take input getting managed reverse car turn around cud leave house amd started driving like gravel driveway pullin onto road oh god thought overwhelmimg got end driveway started turn left little early took tree neighbour transplanted two wks prior screamin wholetime slow as turn tried correct overloaded turned left instd turning right anythin
tell people get trapped burning death trap pal driverless car suck
depending much machine
got ta find another way pay people many job taken rough enough market
wonder point theyll remove driver seatwheel altogether make room would risk tho case car break need manual control people would scared jump way controlling even wanted
million people die vehicle related crash year one tesla get crash noooooooo tesla baaaaaaaaaaad
im sure theyve got kind system place wondering car doessees there another driverless vehicle nearby imagine sending lidar pulse would hard receive pulse car
cheer shoutout wendover production love channel
waymo make public simulation builder anyone build scenario many bicycle want car ai battle reality
put simulation gta v player
theyve driven billion mile virtually throw everything including laying belly skateboard seeing car stop
problem simulated entity follow specific pattern accurately represent possible chaotic movement real world one simulation considered panacea
captaincataractss everything impossible thats better
captaincataractss problem showing public responds non controlled situation
technology functional small scale limited circumstance full self driving still year away widespread adoption edit elevator different much simpler one way motion obstacle point driver move stop right time plane much different since set path nearly plane controlled atc airport set place sensor weather humidity pressure temperature distance plane direction plane sensor indicator beacon obstacle air ever fewer come suddenly front car face much bigger problem since lot road would constantly maintained car sensor know road divide edge also roadworks navigate car would know deal distracted pedestrian jaywalker deal car unexpected movement deal different kind road different place especially small narrow one older townscities deal dirt road etc there much problem driverless car overcome like third related car self driving ability road infrastructure thats main reason full self driving widespread adoption far away still car might start appear slowly might great ultrawide u streetshighways drive narrow european city street dont think oh safety yes lot circumstance driverless car safer average driver situation almost driver wouldnt make mistake self driving car car good self driving one much safer average driver cant par
think big brother situation bad wait car everywhere real time recreation urban environment high definition video wonder google data goldmine marketing matter time law enforcement want data
fair get people stop owning car end auto oriented development would fantastic
thats pretty neat cant wait everyone swap driverless car soon enjoy driving car without worrying everyone else driving one phone
thing drive really aggressively doesnt thats im board
two thing main concern autonomous car deal rare extremely important safety situation consider neighbourhood small child run parked car mom shout stop hold hand car human driver understand situation could hard autonomous car get right feature consider teen yelling stop mess random autonomous car really hard get right second thing think distracted driving primary reason people becoming worse driver car get better driver aid like ab cruise control lane maintenance etc driver getting comfortable thinking car handle mundane task thus secondary driver look phone thing google car guy falling asleep good albeit extreme example live canada lot people think drive summer crash good driver come winter people sliding intersection hitting curb plowing ditch like saying cook make itchyban kd im going starve anytime soon know cook
google owns waymo posting incase people didnt know
get truly popular sufficient user itll get cancelled
perfect road ideal weather work presumably theyve fixed driving side bus thing ill assume moment problem isnt making work time long tail sudden downpour visibility drop nearly nil second moving construction zone old line blacked new one placed angle reflection old new make look similar suddenly clear line flash flood happened mile highway im sitting whiteout blowing snow thing judgment ability improvise rather year driving history major way deal got enthusiastic self drive darpa stopped holding self drive challenge technology goodno longer advanced research topic view apparently google pre waymo published video vehicle sitting thing human didnt le event showed premature hype like car driving side bus number seemingly inexcusable tesla accident like distinguishing stopped fire truck wasnt overhead road signsay youre level driving driving side tractor trailer sunlight blinded itll take drive nice day multi lane road convince show driving sudden squall child piling school poor lighting driven rain making lidar picture complicated shopping bag blowing street maybe homework assignment amongst nice day driving may mean theyre one percent way
answered poll year away answered way dont like idea dont trust answered way opinion people dont trust much pushback people who job depend transporting people good much standing way roll autonomous vehicle soon
driverless car cause accident even stationary behave totally unlike normal driver like stopping odd place long time
derek think underestimate importance natural selection
everytime car start unspkippable ad raid shadow legend
driverless car solution problem car carculture driver mean yes driver also problem car bigger problem
pilot error see air accident caused pilot error could wonder still pilot reason pilot prevents far accident would happen problem hard quantify thing dont happen
ah yes survivorship bias nonsurvivorship bias haha
bit like vaccine heard flu related death bad reaction vaccine might think oh vaccine bad whats really happening flu death insanely diminished waaay secondary consideration bad reaction becomes prominent
huge phenomenon economics often used justify thing like example government assistance project government project creates say job cost x dollar great dont see never many job would created money spent differently confidently say created
source statement
doesnt apply case though
thanks
lol literally sold
get selfdriving vehicle elderly people asap often condition still road cant react anything properly time drive like half speed limit insanely dangerous yes driving slow dangerous
love idea le human interaction hate le control realize bias also dont trust drive also good adapting doesnt surprise driverless doesnt bother people used
really believe better driverless car get faster airport want
sponsored video would great made video included point view transportation engineer planner autonomous car future transportation born raised vancouver im wrong already good idea value walkable neighbourhood value public transportation
current tech still requires pristine road well marked wont work heavy rain wont work snowy road yes least decade away stop deluding
car might hit others others hit
reason dont trust self driving car software engineer know easy major bug go unnoticed long time
cutest like smartcar look fan
problem driverless car despite reducing accident death traffic response firm get wont million thank letter k lawsuit
agree think itll eventually take signing nonliability agreement company like tesla waymo longer blamed autonomous driving accident majority vehicle entirely autonomous big thing every car linked software fully autonomous would never room mistake since vehicle linked one another accident would fault software point
also still doesnt solve deeplyingrained fundamental problem cardependent city video example lived long idea cardependent citysuburb simply taken fact started anybody born dead
wanidouse realize people year old right
cant drive bad weather cant drive unmapped road cant drive xxx condition drive perfect condition yes ready
im curious would adapt according weather snow condition game changer road
year big city absurd life around u autonomous like year wouldnt want live world driverless car
human dangerous road computer doesnt make mistake like human make mistake mistake fixed every car software ai enough data could even drive kmh without making mistake causing accident cant say human comparison ai car saver faster green human thing people dont like driverless car scared
nasox dont think id scared understand idea update fate life hand ai think there lot research would need done psychological understanding human determining fate dont think itd implemented fast said year
would perfect holiday driving drunk people home
issue road like proposed cgp grey solution traffic theyre really horrible pedestrian want city sustainable going need encourage pedestrian bicycle traffic regardless advancement electric car uninterrupted intersection like heavily discourage pedestrian bike would akin every road highway
legend know original title
need driverless car need driverless bus
car bridge there kid way would car sacrifice kid favor passenger vice versa also happens point laser receiver
right primary concern one privacy security privacy enlisting service pick drop also mean log going someone vicious intent could follow trail granted whether able hack vehicle service server another question security someone bought service either politically hostile takeover people started service longer possible injection ill intent going safer drove way decentralize driving ai personal version directly built car rootlevel boot check start journey end check malware virus code injection etc cloudservice call version verificationupdate car parked riderless redundancy would willing accept driverless car
didnt already trade privacy part already social medium phone
ajprobably even apps ask specific permission entire device google specifically logging location data conjunction account permission make service better deny permission choose simply use social medium location dependent apps use expanded functionality smart phone dont autonomous car product rather service holding getting autonomous version great american symbol autonomy
narulizard holding till couple million people using note even giving google info comment watch youtube google account
legit question driverless car know take right lane car ahead left stopped making left turn thats common scenario city happens city derek grew
may feel normal driverless vehicle loos driver seat
guy push feel hesitant trust overlord get rid control go also really struggle see trusting computer wheel computer use regularly crash might trustworthy year force u trade slight discount buying next one waste fit green utopia
problem malcom gladwell brought city people constantly jaywalk realize car stop traffic come standstill city
couldnt say regular car
penapickle people afraid take chance human driving skill dont cross good reason odds get whole lot better driving automated wont get killed crossing street
wthomas idk feel like people afraid take chance human driver wouldnt take chance automated driver youre stuck amount jaywalker
wthomas could regulate jaywalking harshly
penapickle people figure chance error self driving vehicle change entire dynamic regulating jaywalking would become physical impossibility would prevalent traffic halt anyone people would cross en mass course people vehicle would freaking sitting seeing happening
derek look im fact think bus subway taxi driver replaced ac actually heppend year ago beautiful indestructible road phoenix arizona sample replace every car incredibly short sited hole road missing guide line badly marked repair site badly marked inter village road work rain snow even ice car one milions senzors start missfire react mechanical problem car god going car dirty vomited inside take outside city take road take nice trip change mind quickly stop gas station actually go somewhere tracked someone keep privacy opinion car like replacing regular personal car driven human loose privacy worryingly loose freedom freedom given human normal car big question really worthy loose much freedom privacy every way possible gain bit questionable safety
pff tracked google facebook stuff already dont sell data
deltaeins cant anything want use internet would like governmant ban normal car forced autonomous car let alone shared one name safety course im mostly worried personal freedom want pick something comment sure privacy easiest target
nestonestonesto x doubt
driverless car run indian road safely would safe developed country
question want answered driverless car le safe ride one competent human driver example someone want harm passenger autonomous car car passenger mean get away person want cause harm autonomous car going stop going call police going drive nearest police station find mean escape protect passenger
time completely surrounded incompetent human driver
would preffer world much le road entirely would like world high speed rail standard
example showed beautiful ballet insane intersection never ever happen chance
extra boonus never missing stop
cyclist want self driving car badly many idiot shouldnt allowed drive road endangering life every turn miracle havent died yet still despite precaution take people criticize representing stereotype cyclist dangerous
soo nice soooo obout bad weather coditions
someone office taking care car thats make car inunautonomous sorry speeling mistake
arent driving car answer question rider make sure car scheduled demand
rondamylove yeah think mentioned keep eye car case error fully selfdriving car secure yet
basically nightmare workplace
part world ever pennsylvania couldnt use car road
short answer becuase corporate invested billion technology dont want theyd upset
yeah unprofitable
im generally favor selfdriving car dont trust company famous cornercutting design manufacture also world lot variety come road one thing human brain vastly superior computer least foreseeable future making decision werent trained programmed make recently tweet going around tesla thinking moon yellow light dont teach human driver moon doesnt affect traffic something need make explicit exception computer multiply billion little decision human driver make without even thinking human really good discarding irrelevant information training computer take lot effort im much looking forward seeing technology develop anxious developed looking make quick buck
every car street automated safer le unknown variance mix bag driver different level driving experience road always dangerous
yeah dont try tell technology finished try taking thing phoenix
driverless car cool think youre forgetting better solution public transportation blind people elderly people people kind ability use public transit get around public transit isnt good united state place thats hasnt enough investment public transit country climate change becoming bigger bigger issue everyone still depend car driverless manually operated going make thing better instead spending money fancy solution make car safer accessible invest public transportation solves problem driverless car solve
dont want driverless car road want fewer car road period safety one many problem way use car society somehow overengineering traffic trying make car driverless piloted computer busy wide intersection rather using actually efficient solution like train bus bicycle said always need nonzero number car road remain road id certainly prefer automated piloted distracted human
wan na see operate outside america huge road wan na see operate tiny street like find country room really car driver got ta really tricky manuvres actually im gon na look right away
know right imagine car city like paris
car refuse move indian road fooled randomness
programmed deal chaos theory exists india
driving freeway isnt fun id love see number accident go would miss driving car self driving
world self driving car really want drive car badly get racing license fun track
would ton business pry sensation hyperaccurate simulator large private field rent old fashoned car driving
rudybleeker dumb
track like still ride horse crew sailboat still manual vehicle even regular use im pretty sure driving test lot rigorous current u version
want road soon possible ill still drive mine love driving car least enjoy safer road
robot real life
drive l enthusiast car want ban human driver
ive nearly ran car backing driveway scary situation car didnt hit went flying rather getting pulled car wasnt going fast wondering wasnt hurt driver noticed behind car confirm distracted
biker ran stationary vehicle tho dude pulled driveway stopped rite sidewalk wait turn time slow second time hit car biking bcuz car decided try turn right red light cuz car driver didnt check see peds coming thus person pulled partially get visibility see cud make turn saw crash give automated driver road alrdy human one horrid driving
great le duis chance people cant drive get around easily wonder camera would fair le favorable weather people need support project like order technology develop get better otherwise woul remain stagnant unable cope need presented dont skeptical supportive progress
get part world road arent well enough maintained mean california
michigan basically anywhere snow bunch people
ok boomer enjoy youre trailer heroin
summary average people bad driving even kinda sucky selfdriving car better
exactly tech exist
""
fun would work country hahaha horrible road people savage road cyclist stupid thing pedestrian even worse
ok driving fun
everything fine animal system act cat instance crossing street cat see car cant decide run stay put engineer also plan situation like one also respect animal life
think biggest danger autonomous vehicle people like elon musk huge incentive scruple come exaggerating sophistication technology customer often downplay serious flaw still respect trust waymo way mo pun intended tesla
slippery slope yall
question posibilty hacking car using kill people force moving tree wall let say terorist organisation gain acces know sound like cospiracy theory asking understanding nuclear plant nuclera weapon probably dengerous terrorist hand extra save question easier borrow atom bomb attack nuclear plant hack car
much easier way kill people hack database software driverless car company operated
percent ballet car something ive thinking since would totally possible
dont hope car like manage driving city driver agressive cut nonstop turn lane wrong lane example new york city baltimore rush hour
thing im worried put focus car focus make liveable walkable city
virgin waymo camera radar lidar small geofenced area arizona might react edge case chad tesla camera lidar drive anywhere see line us tesla train edge case get better
brad george hotzs comma ai smartphone software open source us driver train edge case
tesla camera lidar still future proof
unfortunately still need manual override situation construction zone big one overall im waymo self driving vehicle im optimistic tesla autopilot right though think system excellent good enough full selfdriving yet
try metro manila philippine rush hour
malcolm gladwell make good point recent revisionist history podcast pedestrian bikers driver could get much careless driverless car assume car stop react well could lead period much chaos real world data good see use expands
elevator driver protest reminds cab driver protest oh wait hasnt happened yet
ive watched enough idiot car compilation youtube know sorely needed
totally
see enough idiot car everyday min commute work
vannomanno see enough idiot car check makeup mirror
welp good luck implementing country south east asia
bad idea wouldnt use service
two thing think people lot willing accept driverless car mostly smart car street emitting frequency think something camera system sonar eye really cause concern personally buy sell stock option argue time coworkers im allfor selfdriving car hypothetical situation ridiculous sure sometimes youll decide person endanger never truly never
good video thank man
honestly still convinced fsd thing country next year maybe prototype commercial product
turn human movie walle
person fight driverless elevator dont person car please
yeah put ice snow van camera snowy weather let see fast dont get cant function
dude cyslear pasifica car using thats actually cool
much hacking go cyber attack im personally getting driverless car small talk last thing im worried
try tesla fsd beta
way lidar work like radar also us light calling radar qwerky guess
im legally blind stay home dad two fully autonomous car would absolute game changer family
im still waiting idiot write comment
koneal yeah heard iphone write know service specific type people thing indeed perfectly working human cmon people way living government approves crime go higher cause much stress people without job sad sad whats going happen im thinking feel
zqpcydbfoqbdiehdjoh see
ucqmriamkmzblkiojkxq see see said blind man deaf daughter
koneal used force obviously
laughed hard moment silence think im excited vehicle drive
think dangerous idea learned trust technology im great driver year driving accident
automation reduce traffic big time since inefficient human switching lane adjusting speed constantly
success affordable business model wide availability isnt restricted metropolitan area understanding u driving people commuting work suburban area big city eliminate maybe allow ride combine multiple booking assuming route match take away significant proportion car road also im assuming case hopefully waymos fleet electric vehicle
trusting man machine
bro jst come india see indian trafic
dont deny positive really barely addressed negative felt much like ad waymo actually agree road would safer selfdriving car something particularly horrifying machine making judgment error killing someone video basically asserted never happen contradicts everything else read subject happen infrequently also real sense robust waymo car challenging traffic implication dont problem tesla sometimes best tell apple orange comparison since waymo stick suburban driving finally really really like veritasium appreciate stated front sponsored waymo video imo hurt credibility little bit surely would bit thorough wasnt sponsored thus dictate video give hugely positive view brand
would rather million killed human stupidity le death machine error huh
deltaeins wrote actually agree road would safer selfdriving car dont know concluded wrote
tasdourian wrote horrifying machine make judgment error kill someone human duo killing someone horrifying lol
deltaeins wrote selfdriving car would safer machine make judgement error particularly horrifying think people think robotsarescary way wasnt saying anything duis
tasdourian know illogical fear tho
much safer car automated could talk know car way see point time manual car would required communicate car
thats really good pointthe flip side though fully networked car infrastructure open door larger disaster ensuing successful point failure attack motivated attackerbe opposing state rouge home grown element interconnect thing better work togetherbut also greater cascade failure something go wrongits fine line balance thats sure
johntowers yes thought major problem
sorry like advertisement incorporated want achieve monopols
im interested psychological effect change people might abuse software crossing road shouldnt know vehicle always stop
manymost country jaywalking law pedestrian actually priority situation often effectively bullied physical size motor vehicle
blm protestors love block road definitely approve
wonder theyll able use camera footage court people thing like
probably one largest problem overcome lot people think thing logically without thinking people abuse system subset people population walk front stick cone laugh autonomous vehicle effectively disabled
theyll arrested hit human driver simple educate making stupid comment
sky net decive
figure liability thank
dangerous think sense rise ai machine
possibly hacked right
boost safety happen car autonomous talk
didnt answer poll according thought technology rather political cultural adoption different
imagine could many people werent afraid try new thing
oh great test drive please please send today straight waymo
remote driver controlling vehicle know
would rater use drive use uber cabify taxi p question option available
wdym three incident two simulated
wan na drive coz driving fun please dont shove ai everything
wow outside waymo minivan sounded way noisier expected lidar spinning cooling fan
want opinion become main stream light go happens
urban area see adoption selfdriving car coming relatively soon ive said year welcome robot car overlord terrified city traffic rural area think tech way away sensor ai strong enough navigate narrow dirt road side appalachian deal poor condition often poorly maintained county road vehicle work better imagined nice flat wellmarked city like tech take filter outside urban hub imo
benefit self driving car would also happen country reduced reliance car
case pedestrian hit vehicle really bad avoiding even stationary object im surprised even drive
fair lacking detail car moving stationary impact pedestrian wouldnt expect idc enough check tho
created traffic rule even limited brain understand le intuitively
true google car hit killed woman arent designated crosswalk apparently car doesnt recognize problem place like im florida use crosswalk people hit turn without looking people run across street break traffic traffic basically never stop crosswalk consider country road someone crossing street check mail something job crisis happens nobody job automated already becoming problem self driving car might ok short commute well ordered city serious limitation put course law maker bought paid donor unlikely right thing unless another trump come along
raymondkidwell different technology uber googlewaymo right way
oh one driversless car better watch hit brake moment discernible reason get without ai level communication brain dangerous vehicle new movement pattern im driverless car break highway claim innocence others close tail something
length north american go ignore public transit
driverless public transit
look like slightly distant relative musk man
dont think amount people died road due human error really call autonomous vehicle rather raise doubt making private car main way transportation circumstance private car ever sustainable long run amount resource need produced amount infrastructure needed function independently who driving instead autonomous car think talking public transport
million people died fatal accident autonomous taxi form public transport people use fewer need private vehicle reducing demand reduce production regardless public transit isnt available rural area cant even get pizza delivered
airplane still fly le chaotic environment car automation far simpler case
yes reason airplane land well using automation fog fog usually mean little wind
look epic theyll remove steering wheel completely cant much control could make insurance company government tell company program vehicle wont go certain location certain time force drive location would authoritarian government dream basically
waymos tech dumb
something suspiciously wierd safer argument use elevator analogydid elevator become safer elevator accident completely disappear also built human software made human still room human error constant change human drove thier entire life without accident even avoided couple would say self driving car still safer human think long run safer surely growing pain self driving death
driverless car wildly unsafe least city street computer vision simply task identifying unsafe road condition reacting appropriately mention ethical consideration pedestrian consent party self driving car beta test yet option opt fact put life line waymos profit think make sense interstate like chevy super cruise interstate long gently curving road cross traffic generally physical barrier kind separating oncoming traffic city street absolutely anybody trying tell theyre better human driver selling something least really know enough tech buying marketing hype least self driving car road would expect prioritize rider life last everybody else somebody step onto road thing better drive wall rather run somebody else every single engineer waymo tried murder thats risk accept get one thing safe way proceed car least level autonomy exactly decides waymo really trust silicon valley keep pedestrian safe human driver uh particularly good technology absolutely replace human yet nowhere near autonomous car also wont solve traffic help environment generally make city nicer safer place live need build dang train bike lane anyways generally suck see making obvious propaganda wildly unsafe socially terrible experimental technology absolutely result even unnecessary death road would switching autonomous car laundering human error nobody liability waymo car plow directly toddler drive directly wall painted wrong color something think tremendously irresponsible video presenting lot best terminally carbrained futurism worst repeating marketing point waymo fed miss money bmw sponsored video back decide could take another stab disguise fact commercial pretty disgusting dude
derek say absolutely ball video lately swear set high bar current streak quality content happy youve made career cuz favorite educational content youtube
ok need simple number number discribes fastness safety serious car accident average traveltime work
imagine day somebody remotely switch car prohibit area forbtravelingsafety freedom
reason would trust car around arent selfdriving
completely agree tech legal implication yet sorted allow tech flourish understanding
example one could hack car use kidnap people cause crash act terror
flamingpi sure impossible thing happen human driver inside manual car
flamingpi guy understands nothing technology cant hack autonomous vehicle lmao would car kidnap people like force people get inside thats funny tho
would much concerned low skilled attack video seen low level exploit whee car vulnerable
huh well idk im tech genius im autonomous vehicle cyber attack scary
firefly reminds johnny cab total recall
car drive like used motorcycle always expecting worst outcome peopleobjects wont get motorcycle massive driver automation due constantly distracted driver day
one question car speaker outside would nice could swear idiot driver like human driver would
yo used train tho oooooo
dont expect traffic reduced induced demand becomes easier make particular trip people choose make trip isnt easier anymore
problem driverless car many people lose job afterwards there many job
wonder would miami fl people crazy driver
video sponsored waymo love transparency way give l l autonomy year runway get realized year
delamain isnt ai behind dont want
god fund train transit fuck sake
government program control whether social credit high enough ride
cant see car driving backstreets uk
solution public transit nonono solution autonomous car way wasteful increase tech company grip life yes
maybe public transit suck public transit driver also hazard way condition drive
seriously absolutely stupid way solve transportation issue endorsement also wildly dangerous irresponsible evidence current tech ethically sound alternative human operation leaving development corporation result disturbing number death car making poor decision emergency even dunno losing operation door lock car burn occupant inside derek really fucked one
im driverless bus train hate aggressively drive
danielscholtus public transit doesnt suck well funded also cheaper efficient maintaining car lifestyle u go luxembourg transit automated
doesnt suck well funded well welcome reality rarely solution hinge personal benefit consumer x chance come fruition something depends collective good government efficiency
derek weird trusting driverless car freaking uber driver go kmh kmh road
title video change constantly
god hate hypothetical much programming work ever programmer going type line say ifother bikewithhelmet accelerate whats realistic happen car try avoid crash emergencystop longer find path doesnt lead failure state wont swerve oncoming traffic hit oncoming car choosing infant grandma whatever brake moron wrong lane hit becomes bit murkier add ai self learning mix however ai never able perform action havent told wont make choice two people input given choose
love idea autonomous vehicle transport car enthusiast im gon na miss gon na track private road something one day however saved life safety faster commute organized strictly followed traffic law
oh found elevator driver houseapartment complex hospitalclinic always weird like hey push button perhaps people disability impairment especially hospital definitely strange mostly interact human there need
ubi
great content microphone sound quality video really quite bad
fun fact someone whether nefarious reason trolling reason going play siren noise force automated vehicle like come stop noise wudnt trick human driver human knowledge look hearing siren noise thus immediately check stopping car cud trained check flashing light correct pattern still foolable unless trained recognize every specific vehicle design emergency vehicle tricked similar vehicle flashing light tho stuff trick human driver theyd level playing field
theyd make siren sound harder replicate kind like printing counterfeit money seems principally easy still hard pull real life im pretty sure everyones thought printing money point isnt strange hardly ever see also obviously playing fake siren would become crime isnt already
noob problem makin sound harder replicate sound bounce curve change based distance weather noise thing listening need listen slight variation similar noise cud work still tricking regard illegal one legally play siren sound wish wud def considered free speech doctrine however like shouting fire crowded movie theater depending one us noise play easily deemed protected speech person penalized thing well competent judge wud easily rule using siren noise outside emergency purpose make vehicle stop protected speech however doesnt change folk nefarious reason use method stop vehicle mugging purpose assault purpose otherwise matter whether using siren separate crime rest crime theyre committing process
perfectly possible driver average asymmetric distribution bad driver exceptionally good one make sense since little potential really good deviating average make unpredictable thus bad driver possible better median driver lot people mistake average median
solution traffic accident hundred year build city let people get around walking cycling public transit much safer even solve safety issue car still arent energy efficient space efficient
whith lot car road would bird animal affected lader signal
important question addressed video secure computer network running car susceptible hacking would make recipe disaster
cant wait level vehicle driving rated way many benefit remove human driver seat
wonder would adapt snowice condition interesting test canada andor scandinavian country
camera stick look like cyberpunk riding crop
unreasonable think driver average mean remaining really bad driver wouldnt surprise
im curious would adapt according weather snow condition game changer road
weird watching derek grow im age started making video he dad wont waste
wan na see car drive slum india south america hit anything id say driverless car real
happen people car skynet rise dont tell unlikely hypothetical
id worried chrysler
reason autonomous car get accident human go uga buga
autonomous vehicle yes faster also public transport train bus tram metro car future alone love video
edge case determine whether technology becomes dominant also nice city highway many mile road neither type driverless car handle remain nondominant
one welcome new auto overlord
compelling presentation good arguements autonomous driving drawback ac hacked example backup system emergency shutdown case camera sensor failure let u also forget program system ultimately human still wheel ingenuity oversight personal computer around nearly half century yet operating system still crash hmm could due human wheel able avoid accident great yet would ac stop light stop sign would handle nonattentive human driver approaching rear without slowing indeed would handle scenario ratio heterogeneous humancomputer situation road really become safer thanks thoughtprovoking shall say even brave experiment
long need chip body operate vehicle long billyboygates get way driverless passengerless
exact reason tech still year away nonideal situation many course functional ideal environment thats simple task solve problem dont kind machine learning ai model yet able adapt special situation occur road
im fine driverless car except would still want emergency manual control option case technology malfunction bit frequently suddenly need change course faster could explain voice control gps input
im cool pressing stop button something weird happens
would require every passenger valid driver license may always case something effectively acting like taxi service
circuitrinosofficial taxi service fair see thing feel like ill old guy drive work one old fashioned motorcycle still handle bar lol like old guy drive around stingray lol
accelerate speed limit get away avalanche thomething like
eventually car need driverless maximize safety efficiency point rarely malfunction passenger little experience actually driving car poorly equipped take manual control people manually driving enthusiast track area closed rest traffic
trust car dont trust car driver
car using laser wouldnt totally confuse selfdriving car
ok bad weather condition like blizzard tested different type weather degree celsius temperature winnipeg get cold
replacing parking lot green space real estate industry want know location
argument ive heard agreed since technology first proposed sooner get every vehicle equipped autonomous capability safer everyone even insist maintaining manual control car ability network communicate every vehicle around safer involved
strip obnoxious bastard outlet would enough
cool wouldnt better public transit address safety concern also greener efficient accessible everyday people
solve weather driverless car never work outside sunny dry placeslike phoenix socal car going navigate thunderstorm heavy snow hurricane evacuation reason promotional video filmed nice sunny day
remember essentially ideal condition broad daylight interference vehicle lidar rain weather condition much traffic construction smooth road without pothole technology currently ready deal
making hard stop smooth current challenge mostly car decelerate quicklystop early overcoming thing engineer
hey derek think make video rather new device default
cool couple thing bunch hacker cant hack debilitate elevator get stuck eventually fire department get suddenly thousand car go apeshit people going go flying windshield dont anticipate little magic jellybean button going help hacker im thinking certainly sure go flying windshield button cant car driven robot car driven people safest situation dichotomous hybrid either people drive car equally debilitated people driving robot drive case dont need stop light stop sign etc need car talking network like bit data sort similar collision train station airport despite fact everyone rushing processing task simple comparison everyone communicate intent easily coordination cinch think year away wow cant make car make safe network perspective make safe habitual perspective going make road system well engineered aviation pretty daunting task technology perspective implementation perspective going make road system redundant reliable aviation well level iii cat shandy sure thats actually much easier task driving car traffic plane arent competing runway runway isnt bending moving quite frankly ifr approach pilot actually trained without looking window fact cloudy may seem super impressive pilot already cat iii instrument alone
like driving make people dependent ai take away freedom though place
whereas might work country wirth low traffic density long way working example great britain road congested often narrow uk driver often dubious skill
everywhere phoenix az scripted trip paid sponsoring driverless company would today instead year never trust company hire popular youtuber pitch product let video sponsored company unrelated would clout
take waymo daily basis chandler experience video nearly identical mine great
much
think still question good tech advancement responsibility car maker take responsibility crash least government country germany wont allow selfdriving car street
ill drive average amount million year ill better
dont drive train either much safer environmentally friendly
reason want driverless car truck drive taxi driver bus driver uber driver ambulance driver etc tech assist driver decrease accident im favor destroy job way
hop autonomous car everyday right cause dont like drive inside city dont think present version handle indian traffic
man wish hired internship last year
think create induced demand price go causing traffic think make harder pedestrian cyclist hive mind future could lead city getting spread since essentially personal mini bus
right looking take work away people making minimum wage instead hand corporation get thats safer thats great arent good like make video
doubt nordic country approve waymo autonymous system company prove system handle c winter bilzzard condition
dont think technology barrier driverless car think pretty much already morallegal grey area there eventually accident liable owner car person riding inside car manufacturer know legal framework would want identify accountability beforehand thats thing stall imo
long time lover follower video derek world full lidar laser shooting every vehilce could laser eminating one vehicle hit receptor another vehicle result miscalculation could cause accident could done willfully criminally thought
motorcyclist ready self driving car imagine worrying driver cruising around town lane splitting chance car changing lane front even someone opening door slow moving traffic highway dump coffee happened able avoid yeah cant wait kind cool know im car around know im eye time
car drive better wife cook
flying car need pilot license world need self driving flying car
waymo accumulated driving experience million mile tesla thats adorable billion
im amazed far scroll find tesla comment one mention video basically ad thats expected tesla leading real ai driving huge margin waymo similar service neat impractical vast majority road world
wafflexorg yes notice mention even made waymos lefthand turn problem despite lidar must precisely mapped walledgarden guess thats covered full disclosure waymo paid make
driverless car still year mainstream unlike autonomous elivator dont need entire car worth lidar camera control make affordable system retrofit existing car going happen least year
cop pull
doesnt make indicator tone turning world best vehicle comment brought auditory processing disorder
honestly intuitively id think computer better hard situation human human get scared shock thing computer response time always roughly amount additional math done complicated situation negligeble autonomous car affordable enough ill get one even better id prefer service letting use
slap roof baby fit many dead cyclist
guess better human driver
anybody thought didnt say name tesla
car future transportation
dont really need driveless car need complete grid autonomous capsule
inb muh drivingbut muh right
stupidity defies description
let hurry never want drive
absolutely awesome feel wont work smoothly indian road dont get offended cause fact opinion
th element time car pull lock door drive jail save trouble hell prison pull little concrete box cant get door open
happen road mapping must improved utmost accuracy
live people think driving wrong side road good way reduce travel time also sometimes people try avoid traffic cop driving wrong side road
disabled person relies para transit get place id much much rather ride vehicle like one person sign
dumb sided argument autonomous car dont suffer human failure suffer machine failure discussion around billion spend every year make sitesapps work time yet week bunch internet site apps offline ok fleet car ok car city autonomous car fail made human failure scale
comparing car elevator complete fallacy main reason trust car driver onboard driver expected careful risk life driving autonomous vehicle amazing course accident happen well clear blamed many case
went isps facility wilshire blvd used office cage server building provided power ac elevator bottom floor lobby manually operated nobody drove floor needed go used drive elevator helsinki sokos old time charm kind touch thought next person drove back meet pissed elevator operator office building automated office worker elevator operator
sure first theyll drive u around know got t roaming street thell drive around right concentration camp turn battery manor matrix
give dummy brake pedal rear seat l l think take something legislation passed
human becoming worse driver definitely true year ive driving people started driving careless aggressive sure mention statistic people driving form influence medicine illegal drug alcohol id trust computer people anytime anywhere
driver believe average driver slightly average really bad
sound close rule
half bad driver dont know bad actually would also much match personal experience
eliminate parking lot sorry comrade still want private ownership ownership independence
love veritasium ad much misinformation video depiction waymo wish see world data fancy sensor thats true overlook fact ai system including waymos handle general driving well human amount data sensor compensate end day waymo spent billion dollar managed build car drive safely tiny part world reason work drive conservatively slowly highway saying human bad driver make sense unless actually nonhuman driver drive average commute better true current rate progress wont change tomorrow
would person love driving car
trained emt ambulance driver dont consider average weakness nowadays suffer extreme ptsd drive driverless car sound good
year trying apply ai system biz environment imagine lot blame there human responsible there someone blame case thing go wrong there machine
mainly autonomous vehicle dont honk unnecessarily
im autonomous car however im sure infrastructure bit mentioned beginning going handled affect implementation big issue
derek john stossel agree
nah give v manual
happens order autonomous car wish
find rather easy accept idea trusting car term driving mechanic potential issue see hacking wasnt addressed video nothing go murphy law
taxi would great thing woman especially night kidnapping creepy driver misogynist violence yeah cant wait driverless car
airplane land autonomously aid system aircraft ground system available airportsairstrips manual landing still required smaller airport point infrastructure airline pretty much always landing airport support il landing smaller ga plane wont urban suburban area may able get fully autonomous vehicle doesnt account rural area probably never level road network allow car know going see construction disruption urban area accounted software program system account thing anticipate problem always knowing dont know
cant drive mile house without seeing imagine worst driver world ready autonomous vehicle right
well train tram bus way better job car north american city built around car work around inefficiency try improve
try zoning narrowing road
believe need self driving cab also public transport though another issue developing country implemented present
comparing number mile human driver experience bit incongruent human brain sampling efficiency much better current training algorithm used car need million mile learn waymo vehicle
work networking field work specialist compute storage related field constant need address unforeseen software hardware bug failure really make look autonomous vehicle technology serious skepticism say doesnt bring benefit eliminate lot preventable human error hard time believing somehow exempt bug failure daily reality top vendor enterprise space
dont problem trusting vehicle problem trusting people trust someone gon na stay car even arrive eat inside leave bucnh trash
future veritasium
cant begin imagine would fare indian road firstly would require awful amount training data
india chill
youd set following distance cm
calculation fluid flow
car would explode confusion
aurboda use fluid flow formula lol
swear uploaded video like couple year ago
still year away le likely crash percentage currently make self driving car dangerousbut thats cause there self driving car one crash percentage go considerably every single thing human ever done created gotten better time waited year get smart phone first iphone came im glad also impossible every human bad driving cause accident there billion people every year drive dont even see accident
counterpoint driverless car arent future theyre incredibly wasteful inefficient compared public transportation holding onto dream everyone personal vehicle thing decadent wasteful past
exactly also cost lot money wasting billion even work theyll lose money never profitable
next step vehicle communicate one another one vehicle passenger late appointment vehicle let passenger one vehicle using traffic credit passenger vehicle receive traffic credit
ethical decision wether crash old lady school kid really u human go like aaahhh fu probably hit marcuwe kling german author
one video veritasium wont watch never let car drive
think waymo great business model citydriving make sense theoretically primary concern cost sensor suite maintaining hd map larger area like city im interested hear theyre really waiting regulator sound like good news
love technology love idea autonomous car cant wait day come car self driving traffic jam thing past maybe wont even need driver license dont yet trust technology want cant yet many human driver still road
insurance literally starve people
driverless uber killed pedestrian developing driverless car would start unmanned delivery vehicle small much harm like nural lighter could work bug minimal risk
think law hold back place
tesla billion mile self driving experience much cheaper sensor suite struggle see waymo stay business long term many expensive gizmo every vehicle
ok raining car slam brake start skidding sideways worse loses control skid programmed deal
human cant deal xd
might programmed respond rain lowering speed first place
modern car electronic safety feature tc ab esp make nearly impossible something like happens long speed vehicle appropriate condition technical failure present hand country everybody take practical lesson practice emergency maneuver simulated ice car mostly new know experience friend people still skilled enough emergency
derekthese car know avoid pedestrian bicyclist skateboarder bikers etc indian know avoid cow
future may flying car least might driverless car
ok agree future question car ugly
worst argument ive heard veritasium make hoomans excel reasoning sensing im sure plane used many sensor loose definition make fog nonmajor issue shouldnt praise something excels major usecase ill impressed plane automatically land highway water avoids building dropped situation handle adversary suicidal plane wanting collide
often want change title every time see video different title
get merit automated technology especially come vehicle people also need see significant downside yet another job killed automation overnight automation result failure private sector employee significant amount people feasible job left computer scientist soon
wait fully autonomous vehicle would help aging parent would help everyone could make car service pay use instead dealing
better option would public transport
useri dont disagree however public requires federal state local govt often slow react carsasaservice would business opportunity meaning there different incentive roll reason govt oversight need start later
two main concern live mountainous cold region black icesnow although im sure car receive weather update recognizing evaluating road blizzardicy condition isnt simple visually looking autonomous vehicle flat dry hot phoenix going outperform autonomous vehicle alberta boise anchorage phoenix really best case autonomy important understand worst case autonomous vehicle phoenix also famous sprawl narrow street high population density seattle san fran boston nyc worst case old autonomous vehicle technology slow eventually component autonomous vehicle overused subject weather driving consumer electronics happens car begin slow analysis waymo discontinue use vehicle probably inefficient lifecycle vehicle constantly getting new vehicle one environmentally unsustainable practice im worried abundance caution safety vehicle discarded newer model think autonomous vehicle autonomy stripped begin slow resold positive environmental effect lengthening lifecycle vehicle
bruh stossel make intellectual political argument afraid driverless car guy taken robot
anyone made total recall joke referencing johnny cab yet drive damnit inclimate weather rural area paved road passible wheel drive time plow road live winter said certain us tech
happens police try pull would get ticket passenger need valid driver license
driver flip driver
big hurdle overcome people feel safer taking risk control risk even proved autonomous car safer driver replace people still apprehensive getting car thats important driverless elevator emergency stop button waymos vehicle also emergency stop button give level control back user feel control without actually control
really dont want autonomous car think theyre unsafe like driving
tech cant survive indian traffic
hit orphan nun human driver would likely wipe
cyclist cant wait
nice project use lidar data make model city
wasnt called driverless car changed want driverless car road
happens someone creates ransomware attack waymo get locked car computer sent place unknown thats scary sorry
motorcycle license riding year give extra sense predict idiotic driver road condition vehicle blind spot general sense observation rolled together get weird ability predict stupidity prepare sometimes wrong sometimes dont see come close call example pull red light far right lane going straight intersection car pull beside corner eye quick glance tell driver got phone hand paying attention turn lane red light pull forward bit see oncoming lane go right red second phone kind put high alert status sure enough light turn green car speed maybe flash turn signal mock attempt warn illegally merge lane middle intersection feeling something like might happen prepared idiot driving like pissed maybe blaring horn giving finger otherwise fine driverless car still unless everyone driving one robot behind wheel driverless car still predict cracked tweaker spent day sun big gulp slim jim sustained see busy intersection
thats cool however without full rightsownership vehicle right repairmodimprove would want self driving vehicle would prefer package could affixed vehicle standardization port inside vehicle much like onboard diagnostics port vehicle onboard control port would also resolve issue manufacturer choice longer support model force end user buy another would allow end user upgrade automation technology improves legal requirement evolve time backends go dont believe full automation adopted till open source communication protocol developed adopted either law public acceptance andor cooperate agreement
lidar unreliable pedestrian color dont reflect light take
believe within five year totally autonomous driving option luxury vehicle within year standard vehicle
im waiting offroad version expect brazil
im honestly surprised people think average driver mean chance people incorrect
autonomous car rise autonomous people decline bleak future human race
dont think canada could integrate self driving car canada filled dangerous driver world driver series highway among dangerous world
god cant wait self driving car
human awareness surrounding need travel million mile train brain driving ai need
honestly used pretty board selfdriving car honestly watching video im lot le convinced billion simulation mile um hm
shocker human worse machine
iam autonomous car iam replacing driver option ok like driving telling drive purchase autonomous car freedom thats kind fascism
first possible percent people average driver since average isnt median secondly think people arent concerned ability vehicle make maneuver ability software react human stupid unpredictable thing vehicle encountering situation isnt relatable anything encountered yet
thats weird surprising every driver one small mistake every action perform going remember correct action every mistake pas car going observing others mistake lot making u think everyone else way mistake ive forgotten use blinker every trip see others forgetting use every day mean im better driver right wonder there name observational bias
sign floop people average pretty terrible half people worse average
first thing india need autonomous car good driver need good road car swallowed start pouring second need driver follow rule strict punishment following rule far behind developed country term road safety implementation proper traffic rulesespecially northern part india traffic rule dont matter one easily break rule get away without kind punishment
better solution public transportation india many people handle many car
useri poor shape maintenance upgradation plus public transport autonomous would require safer road
want see driving new york new jersey captial trentonbad road heavy traffic
derek believe driverless pickup truck made ability maneuver trailer hooked example able equip capability back boat water back trailer curious
still pilot airplane answer need someone blame truck driver know laugh still decade insurance company say
everyones focus cute car admiring car
second degree consequence autonomous car shortage potential organ donor
growing organ stem cell also emerging technology probably take longer autonomous vehicle become widespread
human mind need stimulation back everything car manually operated window huge much keep one busy focused nowadays driving assist place there much care driving except staying lane pretty boring indeed seek stimulation inherently distraction motorcycle driver life depends awareness car think currently dangerous period safety road driverless car eye glued freaking cellphone time much needed next step
cool automation dont think best solution transit environmental impact replace everything ev driverless car instead believe investing public transit redesigning urban area le car dependent best driverless bus train sound dope imo
car going cheap enough everyone one
wouldnt want one could drive rather autonomous vehicle someone else driving
anybody know allowed test public place without getting approval
plus chrysler pacificas dope
big geo fenced area thai car go square mile
damn video tugged heart string
waymo gold standard selfdriving technology best hopefully waymo drive car near future would end traffic duo death
within next year car probably autonomous wont even steering wheel im excited
imagine problem planned obsolescence right repair type problem car tho
convinced yet till road sign car light sensor transport cheaper daily driving profit margin rent car buy renting cheaper everyone would zero privacy movement liability hold pay see many problem outside actual driving avoids accident truck headed high rate speed right angle car time car jump ahead way like human would likely
thought alot problem self driving car law different area allowing v tech didnt know phx many road cool
american horrible carcentric road easy dont see happening within year amsterdam cyclist proper public transport proper pedestrian amenity
wont ever happen country costly
american really hate train tram
long autonomous car use kind tech waymo using degree lidar plus camera im pretty good ok tesla idiotic idea fully autonomous car lidar camera use inferior tech dont true degree vision like waymos would never trust weve already seen shitshow tesla autonomous driving far believe musk achieve true selfdriving car using video camera must install lidar car
fullyautonomous car handle situation policeman road worker directs around obstacle even offroad one drive gravel parking lot illdefined area mountain desert
handle icy road harsh wind technology great important factor however data security thing get hacked malicious actor dont want anywhere near
elevator driver give placebo effect anything go wrong elevator nothing elevator driver except push emergency button pray automated car way round proven technology false assurance people realise anything new come one know manipulate soon every loophole flaw take advantage example amazing people car make go faster also anyone worked cost maintaining giving every control fat cat completely depend
love driving car tool reach point b case would simply use public transport
hacked driving
cell phone glitch need human intervention fix talking researched well established invention simply fails time
thing fail le human
actually give phoenix decent public transit first car stupid technology regardless who driving real moral dilemma sell city community automotive industry nothing return instead prioritizing livable space walkability public transit car stupid felt like waymo ad copy instead normal veritasium video
problem car hacked used weapon
dont think understand hacking constitutes good weapon
lelrond hacker could steer self driving car crowd car actually quite good weapon would secured cyber attack much infrastructure hard since theyre always connected internet
somenameidk shut
feel like biggest plus side change come directly fewer driver road obviously traffic accident big plus many thing come example fewer driver mean fewer people speed mean fewer cop needed give ticket mean resource going road autonomous car turn improve well work everything autonomous car come full circle
traffic accident solve better road designnarrowing road investing public transport bike lane
australian government would tax heavily there money fining people pretense road safety easily part revenue fine
bus transit authority money sponsor video sway public perception considering bus way lower footprint one car every person road
loved episode thank
video super interesting
ok pedestrian going cross
chance
although know car occasionally driven manually find funny there phone holder front
point autonomous vehicle different use camera dont big database training data work dont talk easier build better public transport smh
another thing imagine era online shopping becoming prominent company become accustomed streamlining shopping experience imagine world order grocery phonecomputer youre car get alert saying minute drive storedepot car minute away sends alert depot saying ready arrival get line autonomous car botrobotic armperson walk crate car already opened door compartment car close automatically return house give alert phone saying arrived grocery debitcredit card automatically charged processed car recharges garage time company car continues delivering people grocery instead sitting idle used garage saved minute driving time minute hour shopping time manage child public leaving elder home alone missing repair man another delivery thats roughly hour get back week automated easily accessed phone thats reality could live
biggest issue waymo approach rely lidar premapped area cant premap entire world certainly cant keep date consider often road change due roadwork similar certainly believe autonomous vehicle coming future dont think waymo approach going hit big worldwide perhaps may work citywide taxi service whole world tesla seems working much generalized solution perhaps try approach one social medium user currently equipped fsd beta package
dont trust car dont trust coder writing code car still human
love reason autonomus driver yet ready interface human driver understand follow rule would prohibit human driving would already full autonomus drive yet people believe good driver reason safe ride autonomous ride
waymo saying driverless car ready next couple year since founded yet still operate select portion single city waymo representative stated end video immediate plan expansion city average person able give driving owning vehicle many decade come problem people scared driverless vehicle dont want use problem waymo isnt confident enough technology rapidly expand thats shame video stated people life line longer take people going die needlessly traffic accident
look everyone youre going get way theyre going get widespread acceptance government fuckery time yo learning drive got ta say driverless car go haywire kill company made isnt going part equation blame going rest situation going forgiving mood im going took everything im going take everything mood thing happens someone actually driving made mistake itll different try ditch responsibility altogether im going throat court please take consideration calculation
roundabout going big milestone autonomous car like final bos smthng
derek used airplane autopilot example successful ai ton accident caused due failure ai im going argue ai airplane worse cant ignore amount accident take boeing max example way autonomous car autopilot really different thing compare
think average driver cant wait driverless car fact would want manual car completely banned allowed special purpose vehicle like president car
im curious much editorial control waymo piece fairly well known self driving vehicle community waymo pretty continuous supervision car fish weird predicament car give park middle road
incident car stationary pedestrian hit wonder autonomous pedestrian solve problem
least half population already npc
plan handle troll without human override fair imagine people starting troll example standing crosswalk pretending cross repeatedly effectively blocking traffic seems like solution would also increase chance accident nontroll situation
ive also always thought mostly autonomous vehicle road wouldnt much traffic every car would merge almost perfectly stop go traffic
ive seen caravan testing group coordinating lane change offramps group insane end knowing headed organize appropriately
im tired car propaganda self driving car profitable thats theyll implemented city public transportation get defunded reducing chance safe covid wish removing culture started destruction poor community build interstate highway
human bad driver dont provide full attention car road time like machine
functional good condition yes youre making point computer handle good well ordered ideal condition get back robot handle riot drive lane intersection broken light heavy foot traffic mention deer possum pot hole flooded road etc want create ideal condition driverless car thats safer well called train
always wondered veritasium element u get atomic mass derive
key word good condition technology year away infrastructure would support technology supply good condition
ive hotel india driver
tell tf pedestrian supposed cross
pilot important monitoring instrument set dial auto
tech truly ready drive country like india look driving condition perfect including weather road first step definitely long way away able drive condition
non self driving car probably illegal someday
oh yeah might work wide american road always sunny try self driving car german winter
dont believe company data never tell car killed people driving easy task solve really doubt theyve managed solve tesla uber autonomous mode car supposed trained safe video didnt convince le autonomous car safe quoting company data thats never enough information
look forward becoming mainstream however fight making mandatory future fear headed toward
kind monster would use crash testing
nah prefer drive
tesla vision future car useless
yr collision repair industry knew many insurance adjuster got see hear countless human caused accident one time informal email outrageous reason driver survived gave adjuster passed around thanks enlightenment important change
autonomous car come depopulationist come since autonomous car save life
riding zoey id agree good thing id like control sat nav tried take road towards cliff hadnt control car might gone cliff luckily though able identify error sat nav take different turn
oh shes brazillian thats awesome go lety
think main problem awkward unexpected situation road car doesnt know
happens people person fight flight freeze car could easily break turn making decision readily deal threat
tbh better stupid people driving
drawback car stop working accidentally contradict
personally know autonomous vehicle popular time many people including driving fun wouldnt give pleasure completely
im one say least year away self driving car work night fog thunderstorm thats say going take another year solve
sponsored waymo
impressive technology technology take joy driving driver bad one
car love bug season florida sensor gummed bug residue almost instantly hard remove nerd force remove maybe damaging even sensor
ad driverless vehicle good pr move still ad
pretty amazing get data indian city train system well end ultra instinct car one gon na problem p
would bet driverless car become norm would least one case someone sounded artificial ambulance sound phone traffic road cleared instantly
make complete sense average mean average median
people say average one two thing true either average higher think making average worse driver think making danger average average
technically correct law big number driving skill probably gaussian thus median mean
photonbreak man high school class mate grade aron billy carl diego emily average people average
nope median average normal distribution
dariodalcin large group people driver entire country youre going get lot lower besides major outlier like expressly noted talking statistic
one doesnt experience selftranscendence illusion self dissipates
seen dereks poll watching video would voted year away ive seen video would vote year away dont get wrong vehicle amazing able drive suburb arizona far able boston february india milan million place condition human regularly find
autonomous vehicle coming many maga city india every people india brutal always rushing road rule proper road even section able use technology area technologically improved use thing absent city like delhi kolkata
need see well work blizzard road still covered decent amount snow kind car work ideal condition useless would need manual driving time isnt dangerous
robot dummy driving passenger would feel saver
technology super cool making road safer great still think personal transport shouldnt future invest term mobility car use much resource space public transportation
real question want bird cage flying around cage water food cat get near ill lot safer wild think ill prefer fly around take risk
id like use waymo think mario andretti
wrong girl killed car
love idea future prospect feel major problem deteriorated outdated infrastructure neglected area
like autonomous car youre bound speak positively doubt autonomous car good probably better safer computer also go wrong id still like control
trust system human around dont
series car accident others cant drivei wanted driverless car
sure driver cant drive
dude five car completely motionless one moving people dont understand way stop work
yeah ive serious accident passenger id much prefer computer doesnt get sleepy distracted operate vehicle im
useri also wanted still want public transport video automated car thanks wise as comment
johndoe yes people rear ending stop sign running red light hitting car generally isnt viewed something thats fault
waymo car interesting computer science perspective would trust tesla car since learning drive situation rather pre mapped road definitely need local government sure road line proper even considered intersection able communicate autonomous car
want see driverless car attempt merge freeway lane ending city notorious aggressive asshole driver prediction car would basically sit turn signal gas tank ran dry beginning video picked driver one parked car came moment wanted leave tell autonomous car get way lol
technology also capable driving human evolution prime example
long follow hot girl feature im
car broke month ago im considering new one argument standing time simply cant make buy new one waste money
he way base come autopilot system plane main cause san fransisco crash due difficulty autopilot system aircraft also typically weather severe enough autopilot switch pilot take manual control air busonly recently demonstrated first fully automatic visionbased takeoff commercial test aircraft probably decade away replacing pilot ever happens century finally pilot aerospace engineer see automatic system way replacing pilot way augmenting ability increase safety efficiency relaibility
construction site still elevator driver
question cyber security car example video garage door hacking easy hack car
veritasium came home town didnt know
wonder even possible put place country live montana example significant portion state tiny little town along highway pretty patchy road mention driving distance place may need go significantly higher city city may minute shoe store grocery store montana minute could also longer depending live there strong issue cost daily transportation lack convenience service versus convenience able hop car thats sitting driveway cheaper drive depending vehicle im sure applies mostly rural state like idaho dakota etc state general fairly rural area arent nice easy read city im sure technology could applied outside city even primary method transportation kind mostly rural state
sudden breaking scary comment vehicle behind autonomous car
human error definitely important lot north american road designed way cause danger american genetically le capable driving make le safe instance norway
wondering train metro tram etc made self driving first much easier le pedestrian bicycle traffic
someone get killed self driving going ignore one go jail
somebody always go jail someone dy
people go jail theyre guilty crime theory anyway
mean already happened multiple time yeah legal system cant really handle right think theyre pushing road paying youtubers make commercial like uberwaymotesla et al know make lot money selling unsafe product also know dodge liability there reason push door
im assuming company made selfdriving car would get legal trouble vehicle unsafe
manufacturer already liable knowingly putting unsafe product think company voluntarily recall product costing million save billion lawsuit
id rather better public transportation city built walkability mind reliable bus would nice keep investing kind thing instead
derek said genuinely enjoy driving experience course know fully autonomous vehicle would mean low fatalityaccident rate driving enthusiast technology eventually mean departure human recreational driving apart track
next question would handle passenger emergency situation like heart attack also software going calculate fuel enough need make refueling stop nearest one
lidar cool happens dozen driverless car use lidar given space wont interfere
tldr good public transport way better city long distance travel well unless need haul fair amount stuff driverless car way expensive people thus wont majority thus significantly reducing effectivity opinion technology many year driverless car way expensive people solution driving people around money people included wouldnt like maybe company like uber waymo use well becomes public transport well working optimized metrotrambuss way le money least city long ride talking people hand luggage well working optimized train route far superior pretty much every regard except time privacy solved people afford car use people still use old car bad thing unless car driverless take car slowing highway traffic jam time also ive many situation accident highway need follow officer showing cant go car going interpret see empty road go right ahead possibly running someone stuck see person standing road thus possibly blocking whole road km traffic yes pretty niche scenario happen huge setback possibly blocking road hour someone without driver licence behind wheel cant drive around better yet blind person noone
amazing video usual really opened eye far technology really come last year alone id one first get use one image traffic road accident death rare plan accident autonomous car go constant speed never human error component breaking much speeding like crazy really stuck extra world war worth death auto crash thats staggering
saying good condition technology currently functional saying doesnt work
pointing work
car automated would fine
humanity reach start replace everything machine robot daily life first walking bare foot muddy road invented sandles walk used animal could drive u along created road vehicle kind land sea air want system drive vehicle really dont see importance field science
see compilation car accident youtube human error really bad driving mechanicalenviorement factor even best driver wouldnt avoid accident long avoid big one plus
want fasd soon possible driving boring dangerous
nothing happy pas
self driving cool tech think way forward focused public transport decreacing emission reducing congestion freeing city able transport lot people using le space
use bus self driving crap
surround car traffic cone would able hit one
need ldr radar full self driving camera sonic sensor good enough ldr radar hd map camera sonic sensor sensor overload much process many thing depend waymo really full self driving drive road hd mapped dont give hd map cant drive city country like child eye keep following string doesnt use eye understand go dose use avoid stuff follows hd map hd map take lot effort money need updated frequently cause problem road work article search waymo road work incident article theverge tesla right sorry tesla hater
tesla fsd non beta version say certainty yet likely year full autonomy take autonomous vehicle stick area hasnt carefully curated company sponsoring youll find lot issue tesla self driving cara
nobody expect unbiased opinion autonomous car video sponsored driverless car company
may select road select journey untill capable self driving road deteriorated road mark quite common due wear tear still quite way away
majority think average know someone wrong
statistic hold skill well people general tend overestimate
average refers mean people bad really bad
imagine told average everything tho
majoriity average ear think person ear aall others average isnt true u know someone wrong
im average come adhering speedlimit lower come parking
would like see driverless car handle road rage show simulation dont think hesitance related car ability drive safely hesitance car may able deal human element unpredictable car identify person stopped front weapon drive safety even break rule
autonomy machine pose risk human labour getting unemployed like driver go find new job
also dont ever talk ai run car car camera road bigger better datasets acquire make even accurate safer
car constantly communicating server fully offline
privacy driverless car
broo look like might actually drive time might car autonomous car might standard making skill unneeded bro kind suck though looking forward driving
im one
missed great opportunity put dog driver seat
couldve bought tesla
sensor car obviously numerus varied precise human sens one deny problem trust software able correctly interpret data sensor react properly thing believe human would much trust autonomous vehicle interactive driver warned danger raod direct human control vehicle always hard deal thats consumer car one set pedal one steering wheel till either driver passenger many current autonomous car put human driver behind wheel thats point contention human attention span limited sens arent constantly engaged action reaction driving naturally get distracted like sleep fight harder get
always diagnose parking space valid time honk horn something way doesnt move recognize flooded road would unsafe try cross react debris road heavy traffic behave enter highway right move extreme left left lane exit multilane road heavy traffic would stuck traffic light
first scary safer q plane take account plane much wouldnt percent safe safer human like experience shift barrier
poll would get inside plane without pilot see many ppl would answer honest yes even though machine make mistake plane crash come human error
stake hand plane far greater would want least trained professional make sure everything going smoothly mention people already irrational fear plane regardless autonomous manual
long machine thought made human still prone error
well people earn money driving car trouble
cant wait id love drive track thats
construction site still driversoperators elevator
happens dozen car using lidar street introduce noise system also hacking vulnerability regardless would love see massification
autonomous car need comparable best driver mandatory otherwise unfair people drive safely
even safest driver world could still get accident someone drove autonomous car dont need perfect better human
opinion biggest problem adoption av seem av fact real world scenario particular unit av cope manually driven vehicle crowd one commented driverless av make sure drive safe never hit anyone etc solve issue would arrise lesser inteligent aka u human would inevitably start hiting av since perfect guess elevator never bother elevator killing
people awful behind wheel think near miss accident almost happened didnt purely luck never get reported ive lost count many time ive narrowly avoided getting hit car bike cant wait car autonomously driven
personally experience automated system led trust automated system machine human plus there lot thing human find untrustworthy arent present machine
car looked future see potential outcome journey derek many see car derek many crash car
comment need attention
hey understood reference
forgot
happens
tuxedo line doctor strange said infinity war
cant wait future awesome
gon na take time come full fruition problem isnt technology human factor poll would th answer ive seen people would said done ill make sure never happens ever see autonomous car ill push road crash burn baby
question isnt feel fine getting car thats already question feel fine walking next road car encouraging pedcyclist collision involved stationary car know lot autonomous car proponent talked putting hard barrier separate car pedestrian getting pedestrian carry transponder b like waymo car featured driving lot simple highly caroriented environment suburban arizona thats simply operating city chaotic suburb let alone liveable city put car bottom design priority belong
elevator basicly simple car traffic isnt plane sky fewer car big city much self driving car cost much cut cost becomes unsafe self driving car shall become oddity must become affordable everyone without cheap dangerous
everyone self driving car would much efficient car used everyone every car standing around wasted space autonomous vehicle order waymo
whats next autonomous nascar would rather watch grass grow
somebody dy get injured car whose liable autonomous car seems still crash train plane still need pilot
company sold final product
piet interesting thought would someone car considered pilot maybe someone checking car tracking system
question would trust driverless car owned person cant even bothered change oil time car age break wear driverless car deal
genuine question guy north lidar handle snow falling accumulation
problem fully autonomous vehicle car human driver fully autonomous vehicle car would problem human unknown variable v ai driver
car respond police standing side road signaling driver pull car pull someone signal rob waymo others near ready remember rule agree got drive optimal condition work going dealing last problem far know tesla one even started id guess even year away bad autonomous car available would buy one tomorrow hate driving way boring
first title better homie
machine dont confidence derek human projecting human attribute onto inanimate object idea driverless car seductive infinite variable considered every journey inevitably accident probably speed probably fatal way doesnt happen look already extensive history fatal accident driverless car driving speeding truck driving wall etc road condition also need ideal well action reaction driver derek seduced
im afraid selfdriving car however car wireless connection whatsoever system secure computer even le complexity car company might serious safety measure however hacker terrifying thing car might crash rather would take one skilled hacker bad intention crash thousand car would autonomous car widespread
greater human error computer error
shouldnt driverless car sould le car driver car general make crossing street difficult pedestrian way showed end video remember car general dont help much combating climate change apart easier get car comfortable car higher demand car road road take space nothing grows
rocket league hitboxes
interested knowing driverless vehicle handle situation different weather condition especially bad one like heavy snow stormy one
well handle rain snow fog though thats super important factor
think could handle condition would wonder could still tell line navigate correctly without road marker visible snow etc
car crash human error divine intervention non human error accident way scarier imo
car able tell whether siren coming road v driving nearby street
people la year cheaper hire self driving car night hire apartment
dyslexicmitochondria hey bro love ur video nice seeing
tony seba mention report took land city la used parking come square mile enough land build city size san francisco enough land million people
yeah sleep road like baby pee
hahahahaha oh gosh already true
dont need go comedy club anymore go youtube video watch video read comment
taiwan
cool though still think ought build public transportation make city peoplefriendly rather incentivizing car
stormy outside yes want car use laser sensor better visibility watch vehicle
soooo car run bike helmet bike without
probably stop hitting either one
""
show car operating edmonton february ill believe technology ready prime time
main issue autonomous vehicle hack threat imagine news headline instead microsoft exchange server breached day exploit hostage locked selfdriving car highway asked pay bitcoin le min car crash
perk self driving car get bored make read book play phone turn make car sick better let drive keep busy
lidar still work every car road us one right theyre basically solo year probably system avoid lidar noise car
probably year future bit away safe enough moment
depending mean vehicle available definition buy vehicle safely drive normal condition without driver interrupting safe people road
think anything car eliminating taxi uber driver job dont think mainstream driving change much kind like car total recall
nice ad renewablepowered public transportation best route forward adding individual consumption
waste hardware human eye ear camera lidar tesla camera better work world waymo work small fenced area think driveless future waimo
absolutely love would absolutely share everyone thank getting information
fun drive car
waymos vehicle gas hybrid heard engine running think would better vehicle fully electric sustainability
comparison elevator wrong besides biggest hurdle technical nature rather legal even chance fatal crash extremely small least case sure case blamed death person think want driverless car never reality however socalled public transport system decade already seem work individual communal transport answer congestion driver error look civilized asian nation go towards community solution rather individual one
nondriverless car banned soon possible
yeah knife fork
used favor self driving car long time due argument also quoting video lately sure anymore something didnt consider surveillance aspect car said camera monitor everything meter away also listen surrounding sound imagine million car driving around like still kinda favor think serious issue must dealt beforehand
someone wo never drive bicycle commute dont really trust also dont trust human driver probably cant worse also one thing never addressed video reacts animal road wish least mentioned
driverless car handle bumper bumper gridlock heavy traffic merge change lane exit merge onto another freeway etc
think far technology away im thinking prototype ready im thinking available reasonable cost mass year sound reasonable
exactly extremely difficult many area get regulatory approval something groundbreaking truly automated vehicle mention cheap service especially theyre electricbased vehicle low maintenance driver pay etc wonder much would cost buy lease longterm
kineticsymphony personally think service subscribe central distribution much like showed video dont need parking space garage sort home maintenance land service provider user call car depending need commuter suv road trip van bigger group send one ride done either pick people go home recharge get necessary maintenance
vballeva cool concept daily commuting shopping think many still want selfdriving car leased longdistance trip ride sharing wouldnt make sense term cost crosscountry vacation traveling sake unless managed bring cost way imagine booking uber nyc la would probably thousand dollar lol could bring hundred maybe
yeah hope seeing wide adoption autonomy sooner year tesla
kineticsymphony thats completely valid point think early youre right people would still want car longer expedition eventually would hub docking station across country dropped stopping point night pick morning cost also valid point think depends strong network hub early think prohibitively expensive affordable within city county grow economy scale also would able forego paying driver like uber lyft thats huge price factor
well going make car service since autonomous car stone dead without internet company cloud want independent disconnected car
think decisionmaking happening onboard latency way high use internet
thanks im already pointlessly fighting software service dont want hardware rely
ever heard backing parking space zero chance backing pedestrian leaving
selfdriving car safe ride people still driving car
get one issue happens driver taxi driver logistics expert bus driver lose job slowly surely way change job way keep providing technology always keep going must never forget need purely busy want dont think small take everything consideration want technology come u dont want innocent hardworking people take fall someone think man doesnt man cant
self driving car become widespread make sure theyll safe solar flare emp situation guarded hacking attempt otherwise well million mini bomb waiting blow moment

quadriplegic powerchair user cry eye beautiful
dont see point autonomous car instead efficient public transportation free lot space street escence go vehicle sit entire ride think combination train bycicles could better option city even enviroment autonomous car
biggest question liability one car kill someone vehicle owner vehicle manufacturer
htvlog go channel whats reply comment made sense
ok im convinced car ride safely human drive everything programmed could hacked someone maybe computer hacking another computer safe car hack attack thing
youre paranoid nobody going try hack car assassinate might well worried safe car random people planting bomb wheel well
smithsmith im paranoid im curious could happen robberer use advantige stop police car something like
need uber taxi driver go strike
customer likely buy vehicle isnt willing sacrifice life save pedestrian honesty moral machine nothing thought experiment
welcome johnny cab
car record sex camera inside vehicle
im surprised car insurance company even allow
although id imagine car insurance company probably big reason car dont auto pilot currently
sitting driverless car par waymo would comfortable new driver havent seen action idea feeling taking elevator ride driving wild wait
saw many elevator driver specially old market thinking seemed unnecessary
yet see autonomous car tested anything perfect condition perfect road clear road clear road marking etc someone canada id like see one drive one destroyed road quebec snow storm ill convinced
lidar representation showing detection color true lidar detects distance would see lane marker etc
well watch tv show upload amazon prime
im pretty sure people feel alot safer getting home late night vehicle eliminates robberyassaultkidnappings etc potentially lower crime rate thats huge win book
yeah fake uber driver anything
though another commenter proposed scenario person intentionally us car safety mechanism example standing front prevent moving forward would leave sitting duck would emergency option driver could initiate would make sure option werent misused hadnt thought question seem legit
coreenmontagna thanks impediment question answer would anyone wan na take chance vehicle million camera get using tool notion often worth attack riderless vehicle compared robbing gas station imo safety mechanism benefit far outweigh potential us cant prevent crime think good shot lowering vehicular crime throughout vehicular history read report child going missing woman getting assaulted murdersrobbing cabby one le human element vehicle feel safer least safer friend love one
seriousness technology really impressive there one scenario see wrong thats truck car hauling maybe something like trailer hows going turn tighter turn might hit truck anyways thats one possibility yeah still pretty impressive
u start designing city human instead car actual problem kill people
imagine get job offer think cool innovativ company realize office ugly warehouse partition wall
generally love channel lot missed lot made number mile driven little made quickly ai learn relative human human dont need million mile understand context around need thousand werent really hard intersection blind corner wet road ai people call edge case lot said tesla perhaps best data driver granted dont use lidar latest version show machine see certainly seems good enough eg lidar see stop sign away useful information car probably useful video system much complex scenario show quickly system fails perform also study quoted say million mile driving incident looking average data u death per billion mile driven also x many accident death based searching assuming math correct estimate million mile would expect crash damage property thats quite bit le explaining away incident due human error doesnt get around issue ai car need drive human b likely edge case human often know react without incident c human crash statistic include driver error well finally didnt get problem security thing like hacking purposeful modification signage confuse ai system often labelled brittle change there much could go wrong generally channel show lot picture topic there much missing message car currently better average human think there good reason doubt assertion
part context determining people short stop good example system knowing person pushing cart going pretty obvious watching moving along sidewalk onto road directly
think passenger vehicle commercialshipping vehicle first replaced
better come next year
thank people unnecessarily scared tech theyre holding back progress think really great job demonstrating scary
believe driveless car would thing future
worry future self driving car never car something unpredictable always well react unpredictable people around instantly switched manually driven automatically driven car night id transition period im worried
person walk everywhere take train love idea dislike even hate busestaxis human error involved
imagine thinking good thing really much walkable city actually good public transportation
happens computer glitch ie blue screen death equivilent sensor go wonky couple year use get covered snow mud dirt im inevitable still want drive love driving id hate lose
fantastic video thanks covering many fear misunderstanding people ive advocating autonomous vehicle year people need lot education like

thats million time difficult
still contend driverless technology interacts human error predicting something slow like pedestrian isnt terribly hard fast moving object like bad driver car truck even reckless bikers pevs significantly harder understand human driver banned everyone access driverless road vehicle human know deal stupid human better law following ai also wonder tesla absolutely garbage driverless tech google gotten far think might really sign time tesla hand everything someone else

im ready driverless car ready sunday morning ride one used group overpartiers night meanhow often driverless taxi cleaned use get back one find sitting big pile puke sayin
need test rural area well narrow winding road people often drive center line curve see last second
hope derek didnt get large nda exclusivity deal get one video tesla drastically different technology would amazing video perspective company condition biasing
tech ab locked mph thats great
transition mass transit autonomous bus reduce number vehicle general im excited

driverless car arent future future carless city
electric car using renewable energy car still used city long time hopefully longer distance
would mind elaborating
cycle go brrrr
tf smokin
thebrandercz need information sure avoid substance ofc
amazing technology cause big challenge society hard solve need adressed idealy come effect million truck bus taxi uber train tram metro driver replaced machine unfortunatly first time new technology caused issue least short term caused quite lot trouble many case past
lidar vehicle great elon musk incomprehensible insistence visiblelight based navigation dont trust p tesla car already accident lidar car never would like mistaking stopped truck horizon think little bulb top car ugly lol real test though arizona easy road complicated environment like new york city hilly mediterranean country lot narrow road complicated priority signage great system billion mile experience arizona going prepare ai driving world need get arizona xd
impressing always derek car need year practice good even year practice year got license stupid accident fully guilty low property damage side year without accident need much practice speed learning worse human capability remember reach never beforeseen dimension mean could learn year without forgetting single fact

first ford second bet cant handle farm country road also hate idea travel time locked car dont know drive around tractor one usually drive traffic pas tractor importantlydriving fun usually insist driver dont enjoy riding passenger also worry hate driver one deliberately try make one thing crash happens tesla often
there technical issue sudden
safer ive saying year think im last generation teaching kid drive see city looking control traffic computeroperated system take car reach city limit car like one rode believe transitionary vehicle humandriven eventuality car linked system operated fully autonomously traffic light etc
one blame sorry simple lot due road design people still drive europe much safer thats dont highway running middle city neighborhood pedestrian friendly dont congestion people arent forced drive walk take public transportation want cant always blame individual thats usually distraction eliminate parking lot done right city ridiculous law requiring huge parking lot business make city unfriendly pedestrian force people drive make route longer waste ton space drive cost infrastructure make harder small business open contributes greatly global warming simple change legislation take eliminate problem let business open want without parking lot distraction real problem
yes thank pointing
thank post
im ready cheap enough replace car ownership able one go back idle car issue midwesterner regularly drive mile weekend one major metro another fleet system would able handle vehicle shuffled around metro well

sahamidi get referring increasing amount passenger per unit youd right public transport still important part play public network matter extensive never meet individual need id know dont car plan get one public transport suit fine moment situation admit personal vehicle would handy point im trying make eliminating highway accident better coordinating thing like lane change people getting highway congestion highly reduced tho indeed entirely solve million people somewhere time everyone start work time perhaps could part people started hour later earlier
car autonomous wonder earth could lived without meanwhile noooooooooooooooooo
point didnt bring social credit score denied car travel someone wanted control behavior
country car would probably pull gun shoot road suck like sometimes dont traffic linesdead traffic light botched road sign good luck autopiloting
im concerned insurance company force standard raising rate non autonomous vehicle point cant drive one without like driving thought never owning car cant drive scare
still afraid elevatorsi get nightmare time elevator falling
julia profile yeh never thought giant supercomputer trunk calculate drift required turn left
thank taking johnnycab hope enjoyed ride
remember seeing poll thinking dang hope dont trust automatic vehicle would take one human driver day saw poll result immediately knew people trusting vehicle amazed many people arent onboard selfdriving vehicle
cant wait get absolutely sloshed able go anywhere
ill take freedom choice possible consequence death ever choose technology want drive fast fun corvette tech come adopted soon government ban people driving car im correct reality tech able exist chosen without government intervention

yeah think derek need get morepreferably somewhere actual weather road year past sell date
autonomous car increase traffic people get waymo worksleep instead ridesharingbusing people selfdriving car take x space single bus carrying people commute nightmare wfh solves nasty commute person staying home arent holding light
idea people think human going safer driver computer clearly havent seen driving
youre emergency need get er fast would thing break law speed get
course theoretically shiny beautiful utopia future emergency ride would given priority autonomous car around clearing lane intersection
good question
im sure actually get emergency room faster occasional speedingits like run light stop sign
whole system autonomous vehicle could given priority access vehicle would automatically move way traffic light would go green give priority get hospital time
probably call trained medic come help thats opinion
widespread computer virus hacker get hack thing mess software sudden everyone could danger
fair voted c poll people skeptical long itd take make law everything fully trust autonomous vehicle would voted known context
ready driverless car miss sharing road idiot
dont see immediate need autonomous time people would required bettersafer see important immediate need take control longer trip give driver break drive way without stopping little counter intuitive electric car range limited forced hour stop required long trip software engineer think full automation way due unforeseen circumstance unaccountable engineer thinking take returned data yearsdecades complete needed safety technology happens car rent one needed lease time car unfortunately future lease time feature already happening
wildest part video callback wendover production
bet john cena driving
drive faster im hurry one many sensor suddenly malfunction lead wrongly interpreted situation matter especially autonomous vehicle getting dirtier older time remaining accident due autonomous vehicle acceptable u matter ridiculous stopping abruptly prevent crashing pedestrian dislocate neck passenger actual owner autonomous vehicle
video see nice clear wide road little traffic city good infrastructure
know fact ai car better driver people issue transition driver driverless time dangerous id like see one car handle driver place like la new york easy program around slow town empty road always shown demo predicting driver la crappy infrastructure seems like genuinely interesting ai problem solve im worried car company law form around concept get taken advantage enough really scare enjoy driving grandma could defiantly use ai car
car experience billion simulation like thousand year driving experience also doesnt learn like human yet cant think automated automobile future outside welldeveloped area imagine current state running area like china india russia africa indonesia etc country developed yet even ai would perfect arent ready maybe ai seems would definately revolutionize happen like radio thought revolutionize learning best teacher could available everyone happened tv thought revolutionise learning projector internet ever see em revolutionise teaching hell since millenia ai could happen idea applicable reality might different
actually look concept machine learning deep learning feel like
argument make sense human learning doesnt erase human error im pretty sure goal make ai greater human learning whatever hell human learning even entail human surely arent best learning comparison ai learning human learning
neural network actually learns like human unlike human remembers perfectly forever
battusai thanks info ill surely check
jamietxpn sola wasnt argument like question maybe interprete wrongly anyway dont think would comparison different dont think ai perfect yet even ai would perfect every car automated thre would need traffic police driver car would also consume power run lidar camera also company could data harvest also hacker attack could take control car steal make murder look like accident also driving requires communication ai might perfect yet cant avoid accident driver faulty make decision tense situation people find solution sooner later
prediction couple year ago mine come time peopledriven car become higher risk insurance company self driving car point cost operate car need drive tipping point manually operated car become vintage collector item
love channel many thanks varitasium team yvr
ive come back tom nikolas video review video additional pinned veritasium comment response im convinced response video specifically never seen channel idea channel talk main question brings compelling one social medium environment sponsored content exists much weight sponsorship influence final product answer expect non zero number even channel question veritasium question challenge identified technology could explored video could explored thought lead possible collaboration extend reach idea video like insurance liability legal eagle infrastructure planning design thought im listened tom overlong review video
pro outweigh con comparing plane autopilot car autopilot apple orange operating environment close people way desperate technology agree technology provide great improvement reduce human error cause accident feel success complete driverless operating environment technology allowed used
get driver license ill live study bike ride away next year smh
im glad exists cause im cant get license depth perception game changer sure
mean depth perception see world thats case every object appear right next
wahabfiles kind hard describe like looking tv monitor sort
bricksoup ok preceive depth shadow perspective image occulusions etc believe preceive depth maybe well perhaps eye sight issue astegmatism fixed
wahabfiles yea probably stigmatism shadow help lot ive many surgery could didnt percent help
bricksoup see tell medical condition doctor refers really interesting learn
frankly unnerving see much people dont understand stand gain accepting technology letting faster also much car responsible creating extremely toxic unlivable urban space
preprogrammed route thats way le impressive car capable driving anywhere
despise road dangerous part life im looking forward safer road
want one ive wanted one year cant wait car road self driving traffic going get better
believe autonomous vehicle future
awesome video convinced lidar inclement weather eg heavy rain evidence rain causing false positive false negative objection detection rainy situation course autonomous vehicle company working ca better weather kind thing
concern uber first job love xd longer drive better dont issue tech toyota collision detection system prevent lane change impressive alone im fully game self driving car take time
university similar car drive around campus join robotic team university actually got play around technology robot use lidar camera navigation main problem human code written human bug played around robot dont really need consider safety there bug im like oh robot behave weirdly need fix life risk self driving vehicle need thorough testing find bug believe robot competent human
imagine time resource fuel life everything could save good driver drive big car everyone seat call hypercar revolutionize everything
car drop everyone work morning thatd quite long trip
either stop every second someone get people walk half hour anyway mention wait time storage capacity individual hypercars would much efficient
usernames dont matter thats point
shot cockpit beautiful
would love know autonomous car behave there oil liquid spill road car experience partial component failure leaky cooling engine oil signal light stuck onoff
much gas car consume run autonomous system also system impact battery life electric car choose switch
love idea getting human driver seat there much cause push autonomous vehicle investment public transport except privatise transportation preserve cardependent city layout rather fix make walkable wheelable
felt video bit onesided dont think mentioned even one criticism know nothing perfect
using spice
want see safe waymo car right look waymo go rogue still long long way good average driver
future experienced waymo vehicle fully electric hope
human idiot full emotion lead accident mention easily affected tiredness get sleepy fatigue easily distracted u cause accident guy dumb stupid cut get emotional thing die probably deserve another factor limited sens even perfect eye sight capable seeing way around instantaneously reaction speed also one thing computer today definitely clear winner processing information also dominated computer technology made help u certain task air conditioner made condition air nothing else complains whatsoever run long want run wear supply power run nothing made unlike human ask human one thing every thing theyre supposed
crash responsible car ownerthe car makerthe programmerthe passenger even control happens two car meet narrow road revers
every time hear music instantly think john e hoover youtube channel
video identity several key problem av solve wasted land parking lot street parking well vehicle spending time parked use av solving wrong problem human error traffic accident often result bad driving bad road design speeding result wide open road encourage driver speed accident residential neighborhood result built environment focusing car infrastructure instead human habitat build car expense pedestrian yes would nice sit av way work school able work read book watch movie sleep instead live walkable community build city town people commute long distance expensive solution wrong problem
plane flying supposed supported closely monitored pilot also human radar talking frequently air traffic control even radar preapproved flight pathsmaps take safely airport airspace verify without computer checking sensor manually making correct flight plane lot help human wisdom correctly fly plane spontaneously following flight convention premapped approach little different full autonomous driving sensorsbased spontaneous unless like supercruise another selfdrive program relies explicit premade road map plane flying defined task believe much safer even selfdriving car also waymo currently operates easy slow area trying figure one worst area safety san francisco figure san fran maybe theyre really ready general selfdriving maybe need tailor training town
first title better
many car road traffic solved self driving car accessible bike path bus train tram system need improved city need become walkable self driving car comming yes many problem like accident pollution efficiency passenger capacity better solfed public transportation people walk supermarket work etc also noisy car video cgp grey terrible adam something made good response video
let come joburg hour road equivalent phoenix
dont know make without mentioning pedestrian killed autonomous car arizona considering low number mile driven im sure make autonomous car statistically safer
problem still see happens case sort failure example one sensor fail way isnt obvious onboard computer car get wrong information south way still likely make mistake would assume completely theoretical cause seen thing like long ago take boing max example caused loss life would consider rather large scale think need discussed context well especially example pilot use enough thrust final approach used argument autonomous driving say dont yet trust automated car handling situation situation mostly related technical failure external human error would assume guessing point human still better thinking outside box admit suspect underestimating ai regard trust ai drive car safely situation quite situation quite opposite really like idea level car automation feel id still want way override decision car made case malfunction found video little biased would loved see little discussion like boing max incident second side automation plane sorry slightly rambling mild ranting
know like driving im definitely well average driving skill ticket never pulled zero accidentsthat one control still ill probably drive long body mind allow
accept risk every time get vehicle havent gotten accident yet trust youre good driver youre perfect driver driverless car better driving therefore safer couldnt play driving simulator instead p
odima true hell simulator mimic car feel tech probably eventually would awesome put headset get car choice simulate engine soundsfeel thats future would okay giving driving plus simulation would traffic lol
forestwolf admire openmindedness pretty rare internet lol yeah ive heard driving simulator racing game gotten really accurate immersive year especially addition vr headset havent tried modern one though take grain salt
thought year away year ago kind write limited prototype basically thanks tesla
cant wait day reality hate driving dont trust people behind wheel
great video except prediction traffic go big european city parking space next office building everyone commute bustube ask car bring work course ill send back home ask come back end day everyone thing many car going road many empty car empty car traffic jam wont care time thats wasted well get situation traffic jam empty car wasting energy congesting city horrible future awaits u dream sit car driver watch youtube like woman thats already possible called bus comfort would recommend tube dont invest autonomous vehicle money cleaning tube making safe enjoy chauffeur without traffic jam
main ques see discussed happens amazing tech covered snow blurred heavy rain literally someone nick sensor
yes fully autonomous limited area european residential neighborhood city center
video great said video sponsored bit perspective help mentioned million mile driven avarage driver year driving although impressive thats experience driver gain every year million driver isnt actually much think car amazing would love try good know number actually mean
even watching still feel uncertain situation human pose threat passenger car would problematic situation safety mechanism extreme
tesla full self driving probably going beat right pretty expensive tech using lidar need hd map area allowed drive
u started talking future got goose bump
glad available want one computer good people program phone buggy hell maybe someday today
got ta say impressive statistic safety driverless car expecting situation pedestrian hit thats true google way ahead game compared tesla really im shocked thing havent gone mass production yet given safety stats problem theyre configured certain set road finetune every driving location separately
video sponsored delamain welcome night city enjoy ride
really cant see car working europe driving road complicated enough computer going lose know quite road dont really operate law instead common courtesy generally built didnt take account rule could change car getting bigger people drive using best judgement germany might okay go leisurely drive ireland rural part youll understand im talking another major issue cgp grey video mentioned extremely flawed video removed one largest variable didnt take account pedestrian idealized world created wouldnt work irl without extensive overhalls add horrible tunnel road walkway city planner nightmare see cross walk well world see walkway imagine would look like place like nyc nobody like walkway people really dont like tunnel yes highway careful ballet might work city would dystopian worse yet wtf point careful ballet public transport would exactly thing even environmentally friendly especially city also dont trust elevator people get hurt time around killed yearly u
fully hope become norm wont idiot drunk driving etc machine cant get drunk human error human stupidity arent factor machine
lol dis tesla
cool tech really wouldnt efficient overall build real transit infrastructure really want waste resource needed build car camera massive computer
stupid people need private cabin car take u exactly need instead close walk rest way
technology interesting work cold snowy state testing desert far easier anywhere else
excited technology expert never want talk limitation edge case sometimes need drive dirt gravel road idea would handled
theyre hacked
urban cyclist cant wait autonomous car theyll actually watch u making right hand turn human driver month really fun large truck
technology technology doesnt u like driving desire stop
avoided value life question win scenario automated car must choose yes tech society ready place numerical computer driven value people yes think real world demo frankly usually big fan post look forward however addressing unpredictable reality street situation focusing ideal condition promoting car extremely biased record large commercial aircraft rely actual pilot land hazardous weather im fan tech social implication allowing person writing computer code place value life another system real issue elevator operator comparison doesnt quite equate frankly first time ive ever felt one video feel like paid promo sponsor suggested argument comparison im disappointed
situation require moral choice value life tackled video said situation highly specific thus unrealistic prone happen even situation human would face dilemma make choice difference human may react properly computer definitely better optimised objective response term timing choice actually getting problem human driver first place bc werent accident would much le likely happen almost always human error driver root cause problem well pedestrian example id much rather road computer drive properly classic rage induced mess road filled people think rushing somewhere allowed drive like dickhead
adletkassym got kid glossed subject dismissed actually lol jumped right corporate argument car automated would utopia fact remains automated car cant anything without told even response directed mean code must written place numerical value differing people life person wheel scenario appears ex child chase ball traffic bike rider also happens member human society assume driver ever preserve life allowed computer doesnt ability must prewritten code directs car sacrifice one life value another simple car technology issue societal one one includes non driver pedestrian etc still stand completely behind wrote hope helped make mentioned clearer radiolab excellent podcast driverless dilemma encourage anyone listen want look argument beyond tech
idk laughed hard derek said accident pedestrian ran car
insurance fraud
hard believe ive crash pedestrian year driving stopped red light idiotic cyclist crashed side door trying squeeze car one got killed blew threw red light smacking side door cyclist suicidal
hathur see never learned ride bicycle also yikes
hathur ive every incedent pedestrian literally sitting stopped bumper bumper traffic cyclist bang window like im suppose move way something tundra rather large truck um yea want people dumb
almost case vehiclepedestrian collision true story
happens waymo get hacked
hope hacking vehicle wont common possible
doubt technology america possibly many well developed country quite literally world much technology undisclosed public anyone ability hack fully autonomous vehicle government wouldnt trust government
extremely possible extremely common promise
dooterino car guess would possible make inaccessable outside couldnt stuff like updated road map etc really dont see difinitive way around
tuptap way make something hackproof car disturbing consequence remember tesla door stop operating completely case like battery fire hit electronics mean lock stay locked attaching anything computer dangerous reason analog override system massively dangerous
already buy rd party addon make car go faster posted speed limit cost
car sharing dumb people gross dont care ruin everyone
take liability driverless car get accident company manufactured vehicle owner vehicle

insurance company left chat
side note us utah first vehicle operated remote control
impossible crossing still pedestrian cyclosts
considering human inebriated one way another bad could
main impediment adaptation legislative nothing else autonomous car represent significant loss revenue many level government deserve think main question autonomous car handle maintenance issue super stickler every little thing handle issue way gon na type baby woke
didnt hear mention cost video much would one vechicles set someone back
driverless car make suburb valuable time traffic somewhat reclaimed

cant help feeling youre falling hype without asking fundamental question vehicle expectation car go buy autonomous reduction traffic parking lot come car still road still need parked get going anything could demand people currently unable drive confident driving certain situation choose drink start use car meaning even demand roadspace parking cant met answer parking situation car take park somewhere town well sure move problem somewhere else mean need summon car time want set without knowing long take get back rather walking left getting driving away expectation call car need travel actually havent got autonomous car youve got autonomous taxi mean either risk nonavailability long wait busy time definition people want travel massive surplus capacity taxi even worse environment regular car going b instead driving b taxi drive x b somewhere else afterwards meaning lot empty journey passenger meaning even vehicle road mileage driven actual human journey real solution better mobility especially urban area improved public transit focus investment need high tech solution create unsustainable demand divided uneven society
proud true petrol head never give car
feel kinda shady subversive including tesla crash footage especially sponsored waymo video
environment im concerned ease driving increase rate driving therefore pollution mentioned video autonomous car make parking lot unnecessary doesnt mean get turned park timely manner even explain influx fully autonomous car affect environment
taxi cyberpunk emergency stop button passenger seat
sponsored weymo look face said show know thats right actually think hype driverless car dangerous totally top moment said sponsored weymo knew couldnt trust unbiased please tell im missing something thats pretty much definition conflict interest
really hope technology take kinda soon mean love driving car especially manual sitck know human fallable derek mentioned every car official road fully autonomous could even communicate intent taking turn stopping car would increase safety also prevent reduce traffic jam like derek mentioned think time humandriven car become something akin riding horse common way transporting like freetime activity
couple year ago met automotive journalist flight got talking autonomous vehicle predicted child born today wont learn drive time teenager wont need agreed going happen found future horrifying happy
replaced car autonomous one today existing technology would work perfectly hard ai predict human behaviour would work perfectly standardized ai
show ballet car talking stopping ever one problem pedestrian cross road solution traffic smarter traffic le traffic improve public transportation problem talked disappear problem video analogy plane plane fully automated need interact cross thousand foot separation landing runway tell plane position plane know exactly relation runway said car maybe inside city full automation could work public transportation outside city road barely marked barely road technology would much better
well glad didnt end gregory drive arallon

look comma ai car level self drivingdriver assist
personally think average country two posibilities either better average driver remembering bad driver forgetting good one still feeling drive better average person cause number time people stop dont need stop like one car roundabout even close driver litterally wait drive roundabout car side also think better average dont drive distracted phone start music start driving need something phone stop picking phone third reason think better average simply much drive year average distance driven year year car owner roughly km since drive almost twice amount average driver live also think would mean drive better cause practice make perfect would gladly get tested well im driving see feeling correct safer better average driver correct
driver license havent driven car since year im scared there much responsebility car idiot driver may easily distracted random stuff dont know question
perfect shouldnt enemy good driverless car perfect soon better average driver save life
future old man
driverless car great automation result loss job taxi driver uber lyft even delivery company like fedex usps considering wouldnt surprised truck driver could lose job save employer money tech inexpensive use also car culture automotive industry done american urban planning turned america ugly place filled road multiple lane freeway cut city urban sprawl autonomous vehicle replace reckless driving remove parking lot giving bicyclist pedestrian safe environment would definitely better dependency car today argument increased automation reducing car collision persuasive enough however never consider car industry fundamentally made u dependent first place
honestly im afraid autonomous vehicle primarily hacking secondary concern monetized
dont forget data harvesting either government private company determining youre allowed travel even youre allowed travel
liked video made disclaimer car navigate part phoenix arizona really well trained area carefully mapped bet every square cm area practised multiple time refined still incredibly impressive say little would perform anywhere else world carefull mapping training required location rollout slow tesla fsd beta isnt nearly robust waymos solution might actually farther ahead since doesnt depend area prep
would call good self driving car drive safely asian country insane driving
happens point lidar cam ray sensor confuse dirty reading sensor
isnt long range driving highway sonetimes look kilometer ahead act preemtively

fully support new tech automotive fan kill one greatest source joy billion driver love driving taking care car love driving much every time im cab feel punished cant imagine life cant cruise around night car dope soundtrack
would confidence one vehicle good weather wonder snowice road cant see lane marker lane effectively become lane one see lane marker wonder car could handle road without lane marker like gravel road etc wish would elaborated aspect driverless car
want lol cant wait reality ugh work faster pls lol
fancy crossroad showed talking reducing traffic long way main way self driving car reduce traffic first probably shared ride second dropping school child live nearly half traffic rush hour disappears school holiday school term parent go one way drop kid another way get work
fine driveless car also want drive car even though dont driver license know drive car
least good condition there always bad condition every day year probably accurate yeah youll one road city waymo testing decade autonomous car la every city america way mo
well wait like video said plane safer bad condition right car soon well see night
better human worse condition
koriusdm plane easily land there nothing right next descend mile tracked every second car thousand car around crazy strange thing almost impossible predict difficult build ai model predict half people driving google car putting makeup sleeping reading eating example almost unlike driving road almost worthless government approve driverless car going approve theyre sure theyre safe
dailyshortsrelaxing flying yes youve got reaction made instant situation ai driving car never seen probably never see id rather human mind extrapolate experience rather computer idea nonsensical thing might happened people acting around corner massive problem year away solved government approve driverless car think insurance company going let aint gon na happen
human better driver hahaha try driving florida surprised people allowed car
ill see florida raise los angeles rush hour could duct tape wheel put brick gas pedal would best driver road
know also dont need driver license even ecologically efficient public transport train particular sure cool technology think make much sense invest better train network walkable city planning course diesel powered train electric train
go derek work hard gain respect audience appreciates quality scientific examination blow credibility creating video clearly limited sponsor imagemention tesla autonomy one crashing accurate get tesla achieved level autonomy thats theyre targeting road condition real honest conversation autonomy wouldve nice still year away true autonomy least thats expert saying video dissuade opinion waymo extremely limited call level want work thunderstorm hell work outside geofenced area maybe avoiding issue make question credibility feel like commercial waymo honest video autonomy im disappointed
god bringing attention world sped timeline making reality creating video
yeah long allowed drive dangerous could kill someone like driving isnt getting point point b also fun feeling taken away u sooner later

biggest question buy one cant wait go place passenger enjoy scenery drive visit parent another state without take day work drive could work car whole way wait
im really interested seeing fully autonomous vehicle handle indian traffic say indian traffic also mean million jaywakers maniac twowheel rider course cow
yeah wonder necessary use different training datasets based car driving car probably make assumption based law cultural rule driving change place place
anyone even pas formal driving test india
lol bruh smell burnt cpu already
cool
saw many waymo visit az supper cool
even one car seem insanely loud imagine thousand love idea self driving car sound pollution gon na frustrating deal
love technological achievement driving another threatened industry
grate thought tesla best dont
lidar camera yeah year away thats mean ues im gon na buy one cant afford jeezy noone sell
tesla behind area lol
u road look simple handle roundabout even narrow country road
eventually wont choice self driving car reach point enough car road self driving manual car safety hazard insurance rate go roof
im excited era autonomous vehicle particular model car seems loud outside suppose thats really makeorbreak wonder accumulated noise would lot road time
think autonomous vehicle coming wont solve trafic unfortunatedly adding lane initialy increase capacity people behavior adjust take advantage aditional suply soon road clog
honestly driverless car seem like solution wrong problem given whats wrong car isnt driver fact theyre car
hey youre right would love seat one one major problem think battery technology ai even human driver major problem energy running behind energy consumption computer behind much larger problem think already know much power server computer suck cryptocurrency hole level hope understand mean say might want reach expert advice im noob yes make video issue sorry bad eng

hackable
driverless car already change title rode driverless car
waiting see indian road
feel safer riding waymo sanjeeb behind wheel taxi new york city
thank video wish video like existed excited driverless car become main stream
radar lidar engineer given understand tesla ditched least one two
""
tinkumonikalita ah okay thanks credible theyre using camera human visual part spectrum use range human see thats bug somehow
safety important im sure lot people asking efficiency cant help noticing much hurry always believe traffic jam eradicated roadway reserved autonomous vehicle getting point seems like big prisonerdilemmatype hurdle get impatient driver willingly let go wheel cost time even he aware overall long term benefit life saved whats stop driver making selfish decision
thing impressive self driving car urban planning already answer danger car traffic calming selective filtering dedicated public transit bike path etc etc etc north america convinced problem caused car solved car isnt true self driving car still extremely inefficient compared method transportation around select trip also never solve traffic due induced demand people order self driving car requiring road traffic caused people needed take trip wont take le trip dont drive theyll take spend amount time traffic unless actually address fact weve city car people
feel really bad making autonomous car become worse human driver
wait autonomous car hit market question edge case although technology perfect programmer still write code edge case happens scenario car must pick passenger pedestrian think would great could video breaking code written able bypass dilema somehow transparency one party programmer google tesla writing code make moral decision
automated car make safer pedestrian cyclist motorcyclist many dumb decision made current crop driver make activity increasingly dangerous especially world elevated grill suv pickup truck
talked waymo simulating situation said equivalent billion mile tested although agree testing useful miss two really important point real hard corner case driving one predict even random simulation simulate car pedestrian year send car meet cow road issue self driving accurate object recognition ie identifying object world type object choosing path know object actually easy part car see something road ahead need know ok hit requires able distinguish plastic back rock etc simulation wont help better image recognition trained vast set possible object classifying oknot ok hit outside limited area waymo drive hardest part self driving dealing poorly marked road take really significant amount ai training understand correct path take road incorrectabsent marking andor confusing border waymo great limited area cant wait come area near long way handling sort driving regularly farm road
im worried fullyautonomous vehicle massly used getting hacked driverless vehicle may lead people dont need driver passager take car get hacked somehow
slightly average driver know drift actually welcome autonomous car believed autonomous car werent ready scenario described changed mind however say certain scenario autonomous car make really really bad decision decision real driver would easy make good decision
car wearing seatbelt
biggest traffic accident problem u fact get car le hour driving experience expect happen put untrained teenager powerful machine guy implemented proper training requirement higher age limit accident would drop like brick
im somewhat ambivalent regarding driverless car enjoy driving tech impressive though surprised dangerous driving u compared uk death road twice four time higher uk depending measure culturalrealworld reason anyone know one thing notice u tv show lax people seem drinkdriving compared uk play big part
think need adopt public bus first driver behind wheel nothing change people mind especially bus driver strike something people realize dont need driver first place
indian waaay ahead watchvknpippklas
wan na see drive rally would super cool
know lidar interference happen many car using time
maybe implement standard selfdriving car share data way even necessary vehicle data acquisition whole time would reduce interference drastically
lolwarcraft cool idea ive always thought data cloud could utilize reduce congestion accommodate road
think something along line car able ping modulate lidar frequency two nearby dont interfere could trick even without id say lot bandwidth spectrum non visible non harmful light
like constructive destructive interference
lolwarcraft watch cgp grey video referenced around video get idea longer really need collect data relay information one another
weird trusting human road autonomous car human cant drive
okay happens part car break like camera somehow get messed
telling people autonomous car drive year human life prove safe little missinformation cant really compare human brain perception time machine one work differently different even consider car ai based neural network software type neural network organic one yes design inspired organic one fully represent
thats make interesting ad
want one first hundred thousand people get one im
street filled wont sensor especially lidar radar interfere eachother
afraid driverless car unfathomable human stupidity driverless car coexist human driver human driver chaotic
like said good condition technology functional driverless car need least functional every condition best driver good condition there plenty evidence driverless car running thing human could avoided running sure talking different level autonomy level autonomy literally degree confidence software confidence misplaced get level car worse human also lot bad take opinion driverless car absolutely make mistake human would properly trained software engineer somebody doesnt trust fully autonomous car think drive better software know difference software intelligence human intelligence software intelligence get job done matter consequence situation unclear car doesnt safe default situation software absolutely drive deadly crash following bad instruction human generally see fatal crash make every effort avoid fatal crash also even close fair compare autopilot autoland driving road im saying skill necessary fly land plane lesser skill drive car come flying landing plane usually arent talking plane close one plane slowing little affect plane air lot opportunity two car collide two plane collide thing pedestrian like would notice airplane autopilot autopilot control direction speed altitude another plane coming towards there another system telling pilot avoid plane might take pilot isnt responding system pretty much available commercial plane pretty rarely used considering regulated airspace autolanding pretty much thing normal flying fly runway heading maintain given speed slowly bring altitude runway altitude person plane enters runway safety zone auto landing completely ignore keep flying even mean death driverless car system developed assumption autopilot autoland would incredibly unsafe dynamic driving different dynamic flying said driverless car prepare possibility pedestrian bike might take sure intended implied human dont already know fact see person walking around parking lot im going slow case decide cross front something else unexpected driving ive avoided accident noticing driver act irrational preparing potentially hitting exactly strange human start predicting people around going trying prepare im glad youre excited tech get ill pretty excited anywhere close point fully trust driverless car especially none thing driverless car seems groundbreaking driver feel waiting car turning trying predict driver cyclist pedestrian going go groundbreaking driving strategy probably using driverless car see think wow hard stop pedestrian understand yet probably telling people technology ready adopted
sweety hotgirl vlogs yeah already knew part training ai recognize object doesnt help logic determines information
biggest hurdle going oil company dont want accident would lose large percentage profit corporation general dont want make thing dont break literally zero incentive even research product last year basic maintenance figuring get corporation push back safe tech going longest post development
clear im yes driverless car regard hour driving comparison human x hour driving billion year evolution handling dynamic world much observation skill massively underrated comparison car billion driver v single human seems little biased
could also ride bike really want le parking lot
already completely autonomous steering wheel pedal whats point
either modified normal car need ability move around manually maybe required law
chance city catania submerged lava ai car roaming

good video need go beach get sun
know right person entered car ride destination someone else enters
good car start getting hacked p
video lame video science advertisement praising big business warm light
great idea right someone figure way upload malware car
influence need talk politically correct way idiot drive drunk
general term drunk driver driver drug medication
politically correct also accurate broad eg high driver drunk driver cocained driver get picture
influence includes people well legal limit still inebriated enough affect performance slightbutdangerous way human would never notice also includes sort drug alcohol including lifesaving prescription med cause mild sideeffects severe enough warrant legal limit still severe enough give selfdriving car edge human driver take politically correct acknowledging dont drunk impaired especially compared selfdriving car never tire hunger
thank argument using broader definition ear phrase doesnt live severity problem might though
concern rare situation example car stop whenever see person robber deliberately make car stop rob youre object wont budge anxious good reason
stop robber rob taxi tldr yes overthinking plus police robocar record everything
arent door locked drive seem pretty paranoid
locked door full surveillance going make robbing getting away pretty difficult addition could emergency exit button dangerous area bullet proof window might installed also every car look robber going know one rob
concern stuck gridlocked traffic caused dipshit rubbernecking
also instant call police incase accident
perception agree driver becoming worse id love see number would rad investigation validate
year asking
ummmm people dont stay lane phoenix know live
cant driver average driver get score score score score score score average score people average see reason driving ability follow normal distribution drive safely score high mind crash hit thing score low would expect people well well average
waste space infrastructure train efficient due far lower rolling resistance dont need scar earth lithium mine lane highway importantly provide transit everyone without person planet needing metal box car even selfdriving electric one solution
imagine vehicle technology zero human drivingin year may smaller place adopt strategy let see many people per caput die result vehicle year space place like
dont think waymo near autonomy rather something work limited space best contender teledyne flir tesla vision
need robot taxi driver called johnnyjohnny cab
thats good city people live dirt road change weather
time taxi driver learn code without job soon
incident car stationary pedestrian hit thats need
though dont actually full picture cyclist may calculated car would keep going car decided brake effectively forcing accident im technology one side story
apoema sure would choose autonomous vehicle cause kill zero people might perform sudden unexpected movement humancontrolled car might occasionally run kill random pedestrianscyclists
also could drove sidewalk stopped front cyclist causing accident blocking way
leoneqei im pretty sure would include report drove sidewalk
apoema probably would happened actually nobody crash stationary car doesnt make sense
great let solve nothing consumption congestion building better transportation option general even reference revolution commuting end reduce number car instead keeping mindless consumption going typical north american way looking thing
think billion mile amount incident none tragic one wouldnt believe autonomous driving near future puristic thought eliminating human factor several thing currently involved lead lot improvement good creating thing improve currently
weird name derek name also derek
would absolutely terrified driven around computer
state waymo available right id love try im visiting state
sound like jet thou
feel like believe one step aspect ban manually driven car soon eventually get board
engaging narration one channel watched entire video without bounce
think could interesting see concept fully autonomous vehicle applied public transport sense normal five sevenseat car shared multiplemany user taking concept public transit line bus applying autonomous vehicle public transport need rely available driver may freely adjust line departure according demand im still excited selfdriving car implementation far seems uscentric solve issue like urban suburban sprawl us car dependency
welcome europe
miss black film glass car
drive always look driver ideots cant drive cant count many time proved right edit dont forget people hurry get somewhere real maniac behind weel
counting time proved wrong counting time nothing happens everyone drive normally
drive speed limit ill get minute sooner
waymo experience
ok im impressed technology many airbags installed
need fully auto car vega asap unfortunately surface road complete shamble city never fix theyd rather tear section freeway give illusion roadwork getting done rest road get coned left way year
need car like minority report faster race car comfortable enough sleep driving
drive indian road earn respect
shut
mean driverless car drive without needing driver license
dont want autonomous car want reliable network train tram
come europe
fascinated number time saving technology human create make time concluded sleep
think mistake conflate concept driverless car replacing private auto ownership public auto ownership well get rid car something city planner dream country suburb need desire
currently autonomous vehicle much better tedious continuous task like staying lane adjusting perfectly vehicle ahead making smooth movement human come complex situation ai yet understand take account proceed
reason would likely get self driving car people making mistake dum thing drive step self driving car drive city self driving car would scared
imagine one people got driver license job something suddenly driverless car go boom
driverless car arent gon na take day
first video veritasium stopped derek nothing wrong dont like topic
explanation
question im assuming car using internet sort im wondering possible individual car hacked
airplane redundant system handle failure car equipped handle component system failure people hacking lidar blowup balloon think autonomous car increase hack increase hows waymo going handle scale problem
think self driving car designed differently normal car people get different technology normal car computer attached flex tape calling shot
every car lidar without interfering eachothers sensor
intelligent point
actually interesting question guess something like wifi pollution might occur
every lidar could use slightly different frequency dont interfere way wifi router use different frequence appartment building reason
yes simple vehicle send coded chirp use come back correct code data also use chirp vehicle accurately place map time along able share road condition data following vehicle avoid pothole first one get visual vehicle sensor package detects wheel impacting pothole
becomes real problem could randomize frequency emitted pulse every fire filter noise plus crossreference sensor like camera radar throw away erroneous measurement
wanted know worked traffic light guess wont get answer
derik love video need point coulpe thing first airplane way present automatic landing implies plane could land automatic anywhere condition couldnt farther truth automatic landing procedure require lot ground infrastructure pull plane constantly guided way touch array precise ground radio beacon keep glide slope aligned runway object runway auto pilot would run without pilot intervention also weather landing might looked bad foggy meaning visibility compromised trully severe condition strong turbulence malfunction auto pilot airplane actually disengages condition capability thats plane automated autonomous second critic cgp grey well think autonomous vehicle solve traffic extremely naive short clip intersection cgp grey assumes variable always stay within intersection meaning pedestrian ciclists animal flat tire mechanical problem could account would driving well kmh residential area cant dont solution traffic public transport woman end video say want sti back use time commute well right need take bus subway train extremely inneficient everyone drive car commuting place time
camera lidar great really wondering would work snowing vw mere radar parking sensor front winter morning sleet come sky sometimes stop twice clean radar cruise control continue working spinning thingie mirror side ridiculous northern climate certain weather driving behind wheeler cover thin mud matter minute mean california arizona ok northern europe much
setting aside callous utilitarian dismissal avoids answering question choice extreme impossible improbable scenario issue driverless car le whether better human reducing fatality accident who held liable something actually happens
fully autonomous electric vehicle come handy globalists get smart city sorted rewilding area car wont even steering wheel pedal take anywhere arent allowed go city countryside instance keep em
weird thing weird u next year generation would like weird old people used think autonomous car weird
want one guess law let u fully auto usage
wonder driving become like horse riding know people horse horse riding hobby passion probably net positive overall definite negative passionate subject
welcome jurassic park
human every year next year game changing yeah
elon musk would proud
huge amount potential improve quality life increase safety must also cautious loss job transport industry fleet truck going direction end needing one security guard instead dozen driver could big issue windfall technology isnt shared properly throughout population
wonder autonomous car get good drive indian road
million mile experience wonder learnt stay away bmws
love elevator analogy
great one carry people one space efficient say oh wait already bus even better train tram yeah people drive passenger case thats reallt matter imo
passenger may matter consideration may make care difference though
one big use case autonomous vehicle first mile last mile ride hail use case taking rider bus stopstrain station destination public transportation impeded number thing think av may big incentive invest longer distance public transportation traveler much smaller incentive bring car travel
thats great train bus dont solve last mile problem think good bring though part whole solution still arent bus go house grocery store back there way anyone would want make bus route little potential also far many single occupant vehicle big congested freeway also need addressed
aaronrobinson true thats walking cycling come example huge bicycle parking big train station netherlands reason get rid car especially parking suddenly way denser city easily get everywhere without car want get something heavy cargo bike get delivered
davidwuhrer besides efficient quiet nahhh cant think anything think ill fine dont mention either
rich car everyone else use public transportation van bus optimize route based need pick le wait travel current public transit get drive many people used
biggest fear autonomous vehicle around always winter driving condition yeah sure california might work ice dont ice california anyone know whats advancement test northern climate
hurt accident one could argue would better responsible question someone else get hurt better know computer fault would wonder could prevented injury control im talking statistic mental trauma causing unintentional harm someone else
forgot one important point u would loose job
thats happenes elevator driver many job got automated
thats bad thing there always concern new tech come happened tractor thing introduced necessary advancing someone put job doesnt mean advance
thats great put mind better satisfying pursuit
greensail fpv thats already predicted elon musk jeff bezos barrack obamaetc million job would lost automation former democratic candidate andrew yang endorsed universal basic income ubi near future truck driver lose job selfdriving longhaul truck next decade commercial plane one pilot flying would done computer human pilot monitor computer day work week human could reality automation take
know time people employed computer dont take point away transition handled
actually true example single person earth one leg everyone two leg leg average
yet using conclusion would expect see people leg place stop using semantics obscure logic
nothing principle self driving car let forget boeing max disaster automonous driving system well good encounter scenario programmed navigate sensor stop working give incorrect data resulting catastrophic failure yes scenario error fixed time lessonslearned good programmer ability forecast accurately model unordinary situation programmer people drive drunk drive mph limit get distracted driving etc think autonomous driving system whole would produce decrease fatality traffic seems putting trust maybe simple derek make
autonomous car cant wont fix traffic better public transit ballet car train worse
im curious lidar bug build
thats bounty paper towel come
deputydog hahaha human loop
one thing see happening car avoid pedestrian even person crossing wrong place like nyc cross road wheneverwherever want car traffic would quickly become impossible
one thing get need know going carnt get car drive aimlessly explore place go know head dont know street name town know get ho tell car
interesting ad mean intenteresting
customer never see saving corporation
future see theme park bumper car course simulate like driving real life itll one terrifying ride park
trust machine dont trust people around good quick reaction time im good go including anything considered moral decision
shouldnt far anywhere near safe
admittedly havent done research take grain salt computer capable reaction time human could never dream assuming theyve properly programmed trained correct response reckless driver million mile data must car definitely handle adverse situation well im sure thing car cant much someone swerving oncoming traffic last second point human wouldnt perform better
therealquicksilver said earlier would trust car believe said taking data million time per either minute second dont remember even time second thats still four time faster human max reaction time th second long data calculated fast faster human little worry
patience virtuetheese currently safe yesbut imagine safer year
davidandrews mean safe replacing human driver
many automated vehicle road unlikely event become likely meaning impossible anyone manually drive well traffic jam freak accident
thanks great vid derek hope safe cyber attack imagine whole fleet thing suddenly programmed crash
bad weather condition sensor work cant get clear vision
drive heavy thunderstrom youll realize waaay many human driver drive like sunny day dont keep distance underestimate ignore enlongated breaking distance go fast situation cant see whats directly front self driving car slows situation still lot better safer many human driver dont care perfect dont care cause accident statistically safer human get road ive seen human drive
thats use lidar visionbased
themightyzwom dont want say human driving well bad weather condition video never mentioned good ai performs comparrison want know aquirering data situation sensor broken mid driving kind stuff sry bad english im good writing
themightyzwom im completely ur side ai way better human im curious done

wouldnt far easier cheaper install camera inside car could detect driver distracted would also reduce accident huge amount produced much sooner
adding fake braking noise real jerk move hurt adoption safer technology like need scare people already uphill battle
plane dont land autonomously airport equipped il car alternative yet road dont assistance specific nonhuman driver

know whats even better safer cheaper selfdriving car getting rid notion everybody need personal vehicle constant access personal transportation instead actually reducing traffic investing public transportation
want autonomous vehicle long drive home big day mountain im totally exhausted never feel safe driving home im completely knackered everyone else car sleeping
problem american urban planning people shouldnt rely car city provide public transport
really would like see handle country road mess around st louis road ridiculous way much process staying road involves trusting driver place flow traffic almost always mph car play cautious might never able get aggressive rear ended speeder main reason interested automated car prefer live rural area housing land cheaper pollution lower commute high paying job city mean minute work back automated car dont focus driving effectively create extra hour day

driving fun though
derek touched important point ethic scenario mean even unlikely situation would arrive collide either rider without helmet like human would make perfect morally correct decision spot person see situation like likely would act based reflex well trained thought experiment youll going think implication hitting guy helmet split second kinda unfair ask driverless car meet higher standard ethic human specially many area surpasses human driver
human bias thats putting autonomous vehicle service price service

vehicle powered electric fossil fuel thats one thing im surprised didnt mention
people think average driver think favorite part video
repeat video winter heavy snow blizzard thanks
sound cool id love use technology spend huge amount free time road mountain driving rocky terrain im fairly sure best autonomous vehicle would unable fit lifestyle losing mountain isnt option maybe someday
well driver car im gon na make mistake want get hurt dont want line code
yup year ago argument self driving car would save many life become public health emergency publicly funded get soon possible saving million life year thats worth lot

waymo focused sponsored know still
afaik waymo fully autonomous vehicle right
hexandcube fully autonomous drive single city

tesla fully autonomous vehicle car still require driver constantly monitoring everything thats happening
tesla scam also city design people investing public transport bike land
hexandcube true bt wider reach data collection way way ahead competition wonder valuable automaker history soon valuable company planet
sahamidi tesla best beating world record record automaker tht shown growth entire last year wonder valuable auto company planet doesnt require advertisement bcoz product speak

exactly netherlands way ahead regard
many u see away u hope cant may suggest getting glass
ive always understood technology selfdriving car sufficient enough lvl issue see selfdriving car legal side let say one hypothetical situation happen situation car would find unlikely therefore negligible actually happens someone get hurt responsible car manufacturer ai thought tesla capable lvl legal reason someone behind wheel something happens driver blame

seems neat ill use going downtown getting mountain might difficult like hold one car hour go hiking need order return trip mile city never want see personally owned vehicle go away
wait vehicle automated victim human paying attention lost mother lifechanging experience good way reduction death road accident would benefit everyone
sorry loss wont help problem city leadersbetter design le car would help reduce accident oslo death accident past two year
sahamidi agree politician major problem especially lobby driver union know fully automated vehicle help significantly vehicle injury death
sharon yo check vid still level autonomous driving comparing mile driven per vehicle accident rate still fold reduction accident
im pretty sure people knew fully autonomous car exist tech isnt advanced enough make cheap enough average person implementable average people daily life taxi service example become cheap enough immense scale change need happen car autonomous road take many year im really looking forward though many bad overconfident driver sooner stop driving better
sexvlog go channel disagree firstly level autonomous car require driver limited certain area already exist thats talking company level nearing releasing level many issue solved soon enough secondly work certain area perfectly well dont see issue using area like big city solve many traffic issue prevent many accident fact would even argue best use case city
plan build city town better car arent required wan na travel anywhere lol driverless car technonarcissism worst claim solve road safety perspective preserving unsustainable car culture reduction car road promotion alternative form transportation really solution nah want neat gadget science progress alien scifi movie something lmao

happens lidar every car start pumping flooding laser everywhere
wondering maybe slightly different wavelength hidden id message every pulse
wave interact
thing nice future individual car least future worth living wont overexploited destroyed ecosystem yes individual car evolve wed want self driving ideally want le car public transport le city centered around car anything bike way vehicle future car
id still say fully autonomous car wont still many situation cant handle getting past hard situation autonomous car always safer human
nice ad lol
technology really cool still prioritize public transportation investment solves basically problem driverless car efficiency bigtech monopoly
selfdriving car still thinking transportation term car everyone especially american look becoming le car dependant least make every family would want car
would handle broken stoplight ie power went intersection
yes driver le car take complication next fully autonomous wife imagine time well save
long dont track rogue model eddy
imagine someone hacked system bad mood day
setembrino waymo would go offroading day
honestly enjoy wheel hand
personally like drive car boring sit
dont like idea uber lyft driver would lose job
feel like every car road automated able communicate car near would much efficient safer
better bottom driver cause accident worse good driver welcome good driver put risk reduce risk drunk elderly distracted aggressive driver absolutely absurd cost everyone
think im better driver autonomous car car around mine driven human believe autonomous car dramatically safer human driver including car road also autonomous
awesome video amazing always
wasnt ad city invest public transport
hi derek thats great video explained driverless car topic always make u gain knowledge thanks
dont issue autonomous vehicle clearly get safer enjoy driving conspiracy big oil company pushed back advancement electric andor type non oil dependent powered vehicle interesting see stand loose autonomous vehicle see another push back advancement another level
music song discovered philip ayers
ok derek much car cost
electric car costed lot beggining theyre almost price gas car

wish spoken bad weather snow accumulation thats far biggest worry far becoming widespread
regarding comment air plane first want hire better programmer scandal boeing max hired completely useless programmer didnt even bother check work doubt whatsoever see similar scandal self driving car space actually already seen uber self driving car detection system disabled apparently didnt tell safety driver hit pedestrian died fully agree many task computer better responsibility move personal one corporate one need oversee way oversee safety aspect car thorough crash testing new car model allowed road currently zero mandated test self driving vehicle
care people gon na die regardless fewer overall still improvement personally id rather remain cheap expensive still risk activity chance dying drop year span thats diminishing return spend money increasing safety difference personal drone car crash plane usually die anyone virtually one ever surviving dont need safe plane result costing almost much
fvckyoutubescensorshipandt definitely support driverless car think need bit testing allowed road probably take death happens practically every regulation surrounding aircraft auto safety followed tragedy want simple test like stop pedestrian cross front etc
timothywhiteheadzm safer situation human wheel right pedestrian still get hit time anyway usually fault jaywalking watching traffic underestimating speed overestimating distance car coming robot everyone know simply avoid crossing road supposed dont want get hit esp city automatically driver fault jaywalking though perhaps le often human driving unless new yttiktok craze start people daredeviling robot car testing like human guinea pig take risk lose thats fault problem one blame train pedestrian car even tractor trailors get hit either
im still skeptical first big thought snow lidar system handle youve got issue first snow air lidar would probably handle better human second snow sensor run heater often end mud third snow ground car able tell difference pile snow safely run object shouldnt even human often cant tell whats snow use intuition experience also dont think would trust car driving snow ice yes million mile experience drivingmostly ideal weather condition
u please increase frequently video understand hard coz u r one also maintain quality
truly doubtful good impact driverless car could climate change depletion ressources prominent driverless vehicules add list problem creates gigantic amount data need transmitted stored would also cause rebound effect since car wouldnt feel like wasted time global emission car would decrease could even increase difficult subject dont master enough dont get wrong id love proven wrong sincerly think driverless car wrong direction transporting individual
go test car create sort road construction car go thru intersection one vehicle right left speed ignoring give away sign enters intersection almost time autonomous vehicle thing hard predict would love see could interesting also dont like make road condition issue small problem road usa average bad quality talking rd world country take dozen hundred year make okayish probably faster car learn u improve road also say car travelled much learned way human would take k year driving human learn much car well car car use share gathered information human good smaller scale still watch listen read see others mistake u remember learn avoid computer better yes still least aint bad video say imo
none would nesessary human driver altogether banned public road every car talking every car within human car road collision accident would impossible barring human hacker causing purpose mechanical electronic failure happens x le often human making mistake
technically car driverless car point
love human watch car problem come wonder made far
well good reality still dont option purchasing level autonomous vehicle
never unless afford kk buy one year probably taxi service demand much personal vehicle ownership helicopter plane probably human driver allowed road increased safety reason

fvckyoutubescensorshipandt im fine fantasizing speculation ultimately im going invest money something dont access
willgevo thats fake promise rather realistic one come researcher honest theyd flat tell investor start gon na take year theyd get money autonomous car dream since eartly least original knight rider came one time would seriously tell prospective backer gon na take year real life version kitt year fake promise tend average another another etc done keep investor interested
dont think human exceptional driving many moron road texting driving aholes general dont think better responsible sadly many people drive without care world

think biggest problem tiny town curve unusual small street
people dont think driverless car arent already think use across various terrain country commercial viability far away future
think tesla
love waymo
used uber lyft lately worst driver road getting paid transport human mention fact stand corner busy intersection see many people staring phone driving airplane accident due human error car accident due human error still fighting keep stats
benifts would disadvantage
command go faster like kmh

love dont trust appletesla style substance everything
hingeslevers terrible work environment people though talk phone day big noisey as garage people im sure cost saving waymo kinda make trust life company cheaps like
people arent afraid car driving algorithm messing afraid vulnerability allowing car controlled wireless connection brings selfdriven modern car ability controlled wireless connection already many instance people car getting hacked hit interference cause car immediately stop freeway imagine hacker car remote option hitting brake could literally kidnap someone routing car new location cause untraceable massive collision pileup

think havent thought driving mean isnt purely efficiency discussion would probably see autonomous car public driving car center many human practice many value associated currently isnt economically feasible install lidar every new car camera however cheap installed dont provide clear image lidar due fog rain smog glare etc yes probably personalhuman bias driving ability u also world wide autonomous car also available affordable found road could added info avaliability autonomous driving car level autonomy dont believe feasible automotive industry yet fact problem may related industry capital automation ignorance
think taken bit part advertisement yes amazing ideal condition show u rain snow bad road condition
autonomous driving going cement kind human car city planning love hate today
get wide adoption could help make city denser without parking lot might help walkable safer car also mean biking walking safer hand light intersection removed due complete adoption city become entirely unwalkable
darthinsidious last point absolute probably mean pedestrian crossing walkway almost certainly moved middle block intersection instead intersection reason pedestrian crossing intersection first place human driver navigate intersection safely without driver coming full halt adding pedestrian crossing fairly simple measure automated traffic intersection stop moving best place pedestrian cross far intersection possible fewer vehicle driving simple fullautomation place car road know many pedestrian waiting every pedestrian crossing within several mile time plan route accordingly ensure car need stop pedestrian still provide long frequent window traffic safely cross le efficient car pedestrian crossing true still vastly efficient safe pedestrian crossing today take place complex confusing dangerous part city road infrastructure frankly never great place put
falleithani moving pedestrian crossing away intersection greatly increase distance walk block square would double distance walk halfway block cross back
car train
falleithani see people want cross roadstreet big city would whereverwhenever want knowing wont get hit would make self driving car big city alot pedestrian virtually useless unless prevent people dumb stuff waiting
hey live north dakota super icy like month year well self driving car handle ice snow
wrong direction greener sustainable future good public transport personal transport small village holding onto personal transport one main reason stuck self destructive society freight onto rail passenger bus
make video mentioning company also make self driving car
youre conflating fully autonomous vehicle taxi service shared vehicle mode transportation driverless youd still get benefit like parking lot unused vehicle etc car driverless whether individually owned shared across public youd get mentioned benefit smoother traffic fewer accident
think cgp grey human need apply year ago
biggest problem uncertainty ability selfdriving car problem technology would take away lot lot think job
waiting lidar cause cancer idiot xd
problem avoid people disgusting collective autonomous vehicle
interesting ecologically speaking
someone crash parked car work came front see happened told bad driver wish one could avoided situation
much controversy xd even agree video doesnt even try objective sponsored ad like ive never seen channel risk problem seeing could interesting discussing waymo spokesperson like car shooting light beam around nope good anything bad philosophical superstition
motorcyclist look forward selfdriving vehicle looking neighbor last year able drive driverless car incredibly important life
real question going extra people autonomous car prevent death
developed country population falling replacement rate anyway
mean technically possible people better average driver bunch mediocre driver excellent driver truly appalling one example let say rated people scale best possible driver got score average score driver better driving certainly feel like small group bad driver ruin experience rest u possible case people actually average
person dont want think lose ability soon later driving moving one point another dont drive car boring meaningless experience fall asleep system car completly monitored controled remotly stop car dont want disable people usefull disable going vehicle dont drive bus airplane elevator going one drive
push guy car charged
everyone used selfdriving car itd safe everyone use selfdriving car
car road selfdriving would feel much safe motorcycle enjoying ride
well yes still need better road infrastructure fail safe pedestrian unpredictable factor
maybe every cardriver skeptical safe pedestrian year
dillogdall take havent watched whole video automated vehicle company hit pedestrian million mile driving
ok
im year old used good driver year ive dangerous behind wheel drive absolutely necessary idea lost good driving skill matter put others risk
good condition functional aka mile away ready thats basically like software thats finished last thats hardest complete autonomous vehicle work work every condition even know break certain traffic rule cross red light example emergency vehicle need pas thats required law considered fully autonomous also affordable cant rely sensor worth million dollar even close reality
watch video
quick survey youtube video show waymo car getting stuck construction zone holding traffic disregarding police officer etc nearly ready widespread adoption
legal nightmare creator driverless technology program car break law unless get special permission dont think company ever put model
well mention description already app running fleet car arizona driving around available public already reality
work outside geofence understand waymo geofenced
like compare speech text software worked many year much better first tried getting say right isnt good enough thats despite impressed driverless car already think still least year away replacing driver maybe see replacing bus taxi city first
vehicle electric
know whats big blocker car money imagine price high tech vehicle people rarely money buy new car many place would try affordable oh second law law actually require driver
asiana flight much famous funny pilot name mistakenly read local news
pilot didnt funny name local news intentionally made funny name
wouldnt able trust completely without person behind wheel dont get wrong driver make pretty stupid mistake nobody control vehicle run across adverse condition something might fully ready scary maybe someday car become smart able communicate one another something effect id feel better
hack aswell
real question car effectively speed cop around
aware speed limit adjust accordingly cruise
true
google speed camera speed trap warning seems promising
would german highway full throttle
roadway reserved autonomous vehicle could speed limit
sure car may preform great work problem technology human history always work even aircraft autopilot fail thats pilot pay attention said happens people get used thing working one day dont youre riding mph suddenly wrong sensor trip error happens

would need something future thinking ambulance emergency vehicle connected driverless car area communicate position listening sound needed right make work future im sure handled differently
besides funny think could serious concern addressed exactly wouldve done fourteen driverless car reacted audio think need able recognize ambulance sight recorded sound ambulance actual ambulance would easily distinguished pair noise traffic wind disrupting audio seems near impossible lot thing seemed impossible computer
highly illegal already im pretty sure could tell coming emergency vehicle otherwise would needlessly stop cop car ambulance wrong side road
also driverless car tailgate safely huge efficiency advantage driven caravan highway expect carpool lane become driverless car lane drive laggard get board question becomes allow people drive endanger others drive amusement park special private road
amazing im sure road work crap road marking wont adverse effect whatsoever
use mirror back vehicle dont look behind
think weve train hundred year still chose die car fk ppl power
show negotiating busy british town roundabout believe driverless car really capable better human
future city elderly child disabled imagine getting transport new york city arent taxi taking road one used charging high rise compact car park need maintain store fuelcharge vehicle download app request lift
implication driver depend profession living
cant wait check waymo person
lidar unit top car spinning around million time second really seems excessive realistic
hear spinning around million time second
say scanning spinning
thereallampshadie ah thanks clarification make much sense
many u used believe human fully capable governing human see incompetence im trying like old person im concerned ai governing know least real conversation future wonder humanity like future perhaps well advanced siri everyones ai companionsecritarytherapistpersonal trainer guess already way side note buying car change subscribing nissan rest life commercial change ai safest make fastest route also city arent loud vehicle imagine autocars driving people outer ring city city center subway bike get around green space higher air quality
suck human robot better everything
problem stated autonomous vehicle eliminate million job including many living wage job mean lower consumer spending impact job tax revenue lower tax revenue mean le money road repair le call vehicle general nobody afford go anywhere
dont think better simply enjoy driving mostly weekend backroad playing music relax hectic work week
honestly hope car le le common destroy city automous car make thing worst worst since people drop center let le car drive km find parking spot get busy center whit trafic jam even worst people work watch netflix sleep transit car destination go city find parking car making traveld home work car get city drop someone get city go wait home charge get parking doublel car traffic course car find parking outside city find poor people course poor people get car one autonomous one situation even worst since fight ai find parking place quite crazy country try ban car much possible american still say yeah let go one automous car whats marketing speech sell security come one u dangerous road western world issue clearly identify since decade stupid urban planning speed alcohol really think google care security dont care would like sell software solution prefer city take bike ride safely work school grocery store good health better environment safe infrastructure good much cheaper good measure low income
think something cover easy hack
lol poor elevator driver dont like way treated going strike year later job doesnt even exist
reservation laghumans make mistake maybe mind affected may lagbut even slow human reaction time way faster computer system motor servo component technology physical part becoming much responsive becoming much practical
many people annoyed think good subway system gon na solve everything self driving car novelty didnt watch video driving car choice even best infrastructure public transport people want drive car occasionally getting self driving car choice cheaper owning car probably expensive bus ticket save garage parking space get drunk still get home safely car driving safer maybe u like car driving u probably use car everything choice thing probably coexist long time
people want drive car occasionally yes get fully automated self driving car make sense
partlycurrent people cooking home sometimes want order food go restaurant thing
rodebertx comparison doesnt work
current technology work great ideal condition problem le ideal condition bad weather aggressive driver etc video saw car make hard stop someone walking sidewalk car couldnt properly anticipate person direction make hard stop object respond police officer directing traffic there lot question answered wont see widespread adoption
nice ad waymo
imagine one day one car driver uber driver sitting back seat cry
autonomous car truely safe human stop driving car autonomous exchange issue hacking digital security consider though
say would gon na pt license hike insurance premium anyway might well make worth
wondering solved problem vehicle standing still meaning safe example three fall car car driving road car speed pas falling tree immidiate stopping car avoid collision three impressed level got never get
buy
would car computer measure thing metric instead mph feets would easier researcher analyse
im visually impaired get one
im le concerned driverless car concerned politics driverless car
car tried chaotic indian road result
im ready buy one dont know theyre sale
taxi theyll make money subscription model also keep vehicle theyre control maintain vehicle fitness
tesla exist quite already cost something like k another k self driving feature still alert behind steering wheel law
engineer tesla isnt advanced enough purpose im knocking musk tesla read dont want status symbol thats whats point behind steering wheel purpose work commute le expensively fulltime driver reliably taxi service appreciate info though thank
onedeadsaint cool need know theyll area make better use commuting time
xyzijk sooner better there going fundamental change vehicle mean working commuting one fun think way travel change im bring
hate stepping elevator hope doesnt compare xd
absurd many people think theyre better driver human simultaneously many people trust technology car way much sum one statement people dumb sooner car road controlled computer better
happens kid fake like going jump front vehicle
cant wait fully automated car traffic much better people arent control
youre completely disingenuous believe rode handle driving situation human handle technology easily still year away replace u driving condition go ahead take thing ride heavy downpour snowstorm
derek love channel felt lot closer waymo promotional video actual look driverless technology great strength presentercuriosity openness wonderare fantastic usual content dealing single company product quality turned promoter instead journalist really wish youd talked informed skeptic people dont think driverless car ever happen people would offered nonwaymo view technology pointed potential downside driverless future like could make u even isolated diminish destroy local business much way future paradise highway ignored vast downside hope youll cautious inside corporation video future youre fantastic resource id hate become cynical youre
could public transit competent civil planning millionth cost
someone get rid car would nice hell need move stuff cant fit bike get rural town go somewhere transit doesnt run would nice plus use le parking folk owning car right im looking car share cheaper uber still take parking make trip rural place difficult complimentary mass transit competition make easier folk ditch car
nomms dont car l use public transport carry something big call taxi weve various trip abroad two kid train swear comfortable also cheaper long run
hate break youpeople like privacy city best public transit world still car always would combination system would healthiest world safest u
already driveless subway operation around world kon metro paris fully automated basically operating like horizonzal elevator button stop every station
city u designed dogshit way hostile pedestrian literally talk civil engineer never stfu
veritassium would love access technology two main question think would great solved interaction lidar car mean two car driving together interfere others lidar case possible accident would treated aircraft accident failure investigated solved owner would responsible even reason software glitch bad maintenancecare vehicle
cool
research shown interference lidar happen beam sent one lidar scattered returned transmitted directly another lidar multiple selfdriving vehicle busy intersection lidar vehicle would potential interfere others
thinking thingso study
cool autonomy definitely future personally would consider driving predetermine invisible track level assuming office people monitoring car remotely control gap using geofenced track likely decade
work great simple scenario highway driving even suburban road unlike elevator plane car busier situation deal much input object recognition incredibly important computer terrible hack currently there good way way low understanding easy fool nearly safety data based easy scenario million mile easy road driven wont see one successfully navigating complex downtown area might see one getting tricked stop sign sticker going stuck incredibly dangerous transition phase get fixed
driveless car actually accident car fault blame
rookie number people need pick
id interested see happens car experience flat tire driving start aquaplane loses traction randomly oil patch road previous accident really cool theyre able teach car handle situation
driverless car way future transportation keep presonal transportation bad environment b way expensive puublic c public transport way energy efficient le time space consuming much personal transportation definition answer problem matter many company pay youtubers minute adverstisments
dont problem driverless car america road large comparatively empty time wouldnt get one europe street barely wide enough fit car people park road bottleneck created city many oneway street even modern gps device trouble finding valid way many variable believe yet solved different country country
lol comparing time spent driving rate learning human computer
amount idiot car car fails new driver road even street racing video trust computer people btw young adult zoomer
awesome commuting problem love driving sportssupercars
definitely fascinating technology pedestrian cross beautiful ballet car discarded reducing car usage supplementing good public transport opinion way go want walkable livable ecological city
scary part ever make illegal human drive car enjoy driving know many people dont hopefully day come car available people use wont go ban people driving car im old drive hopefully die injury prevents want drive self even higher risk simply enjoy
dangerous heck banned
here thing sensor though opinion need passive well good projecting laser grid research vehicle get ai going soon one car road there always risk sensor interfering car crashing obstacle think somewhere else itd done camera possibly microphone ultrasonic distance sensor lidar radar laser nothing well accident dont start thinking make look like something ghostbusters would bring party hey early day
cant even trust phone battery life way stepping autonomous vehicle
say person probably technology skill car isnt phone
yes tech technically way many caveat condition need met notably mentioned good road condition guaranteed control road smooth butter clearfresh lane marker sure real world single stretch bad road condition would derail tech limiting go safely overall think using parking assist lane change semiautonomous application fine lot ev already tesla full auto isnt ready im seeing question deal unplannedunpredictable variable like driver bad dangerous one specifically whether react way result better outcome v average human driver id imagine would also somewhat unrelated insurance company pricevalidate autonomous system
bit paid waymo presented science educator crossing ethical line
sure accepted sponsorship
handsomeforlaw
could totally see city banning non autonomous car however think outside city offroad always people driving truckscars edge case hard get right especially waymo using geodata car tesla maybe take little longer reach lvl available area way quicker
actually getting hit parked car
feel like important thing security software get hacked
someone else remote control car lovely isnt push tech company control life even screw
still wouldnt ride one
parking lot quite organizedtry statethis car would able handle seen tesla get confused worst road infrastructure worst driver country
well much safer reach destination quickly outlaw manual driving city
binary computer code replace consciousness never able preform complex understanding person especially rely image data rather complex depth scan sort car dont work simply good job appearing
slappytheclappy people seem believe binary computer code somehow programmed understand thing way people architecturally much relying binary code translate object standard image ridiculous probabilistic accurate rare case best pretty much scientific fantasy practice might turn dangerous one drone start running people
isnt trust technology dont trust human legislation responsibility ready possible victim shoulder cost responsibility
hi derek see waymo approach fsd would like compare tesla one
analogy elevator stop soon consider car property driver property user like people taking elevator sure going kill taxi uber driver definitely personal car feel like care bit going car well throw bin
gost driving car also good prank like gost driving car
driving pleasure remain going ab boring hell would prefer
insurance maker gon na mad yay
car loud seems idling also tell leticia shes hot
found worrying confidence car apparently compelling seems like huge anthropomorphism trap car isnt programmed social instinct communicate awareness act act course human feel like confidence perceive human mean le nothing vehicle social skill im conflicted vehicle role climate change would increase atomised consumption would take reduce investment mass transit safety would little issue percent autonomous road danger come unpredictable human driver autonomous vehicle mention cyber security concern potentially vast scale controlling gating technology profit interfere assist proliferation positive potential outcome want car oddly sponsored video made uneasy v le keep thinking mixed use road rural area interaction animal deliberate bad faith interference durability part vehicle depend worth watching guess
like know kind response car give dealing motorcycle especially sea country
benefit computer remain consistent skill level whereas human lot variable skill fatique drunkeness illness human better driver fully concentrating unfortunately always
computer algorithm cutting tech equipped super good
technology existing technology available consumer two completely different thing
well mention description already app running fleet car arizona driving around already available public assume people use quicker expand around country world
might two different thing go hand hand
cant wait car road driverless anytime hit traffic ill pull megaphone play siren sound watch sea robot car part
thats fine dandy day hacker creates ransomware take control vehicle hold physical body ransom solve problem maybe id trust
ill believe theyre safer driving see making evasive maneuver idiot jumping light crazy stuff commented poll doubt switched car autonomous would safer imply safer autonomous car rest car human driven
next step make quiet maybe
never trust lifetime technical glitch never go away computer crash car theyre controlling
ive convinced id happiest ordinary car autonomous
pilot need keep practicing landing otherwise lose skill something happens plane want pilot still skill
human brain getting obsolete day day
yet tesla fanboys think tesla almost far ahead everyone else
love idea autonomous vehicle however concern come place first majority vehicle still controlled human there still much unpredictability dont think possible account second issue happens speed limit get change somewhere doesnt get updated system
cant wait autonomous car deal non standard condition
wont happen indianahhh chance
derek love channel sponsorship sure come across feeling like waymo ad interesting didnt get thorny detail like usually also comparing people skeptical driverless car people like elevator operator pretty facile argument totally ignoring many magnitude greater complexity carvselevator get eat please organize deal stay dont become shrill highest bidder thank need
futuristic humanity stop take chill
legend back
human might able make moral decision computer still computer certainly react faster higher consistency human driving make far safer human driver
played like waymo ad benefit driverless car clear derek couldnt find legitimate reason caution thats balanced presentation im used here hoping next vid better
part world road like usa let generalise technology still far away
im cant wait take nap going somewhere
soon take autonomous work send home take kid school need many family two car eliminated car manufacturing industry get whole lot smaller
level autonomy huh one day youre driven around driverless car next youre cooked phased plasma rifle watt range
lol im guessing terminator clip randomly went suggestion well
military robot thing
footage inside car letting know sci fi movie kid become reality glad see tech development become reality
driver karen going yell abuse
ive looking forward automated car since long waymo existed ready trying force play people innate fear cause backlash elevator doesnt think airplane would riding guiding beambeacon kind smarter elevator smart enough anything explicitly programed automated car must much smarter able cope human driven car people animal irrational unexpected thing acceptablereasonable degree reality cant handwaved away driving highway large well maintained main road im sure great cramped busy street id guess would paralysed rigid safety measure
grandpa old car also self driving brake generally stop working car continuous move
think voted going happen year right lidar pretty precise insanely expensive normal car ultrasonic sensor extremely precise work meter cant see object fur coat example radar good looking straight ahead determining distance speed ofcourse camera great recognising sign everything useless telling distance already ultrasonic sensor radar camera car lidar way expensive right there question law need changed classic train heading line obstacle braking option like derek said there also question road look like theyve bombed wwii marking obvious idiot play phone swerve lane really cool far weve come though im completely okay autonomous driving long dont ban driving make much much harder driving test need learn car control avoid emergency situation cant ban driving
try country crazy traffic tell work country asia
thing awesome
conducting many survey sure
car lidar camera see compared tesla low resolution camera around car elon think fsd
really fascinating beyond doubt driverless car role play future mentioned make lot sense le able bodied people get around caveat could see really massive future fact ultimately still car going forward think hope bigger push city towards sustainable manageable form transport surely better infrastructure cyclingescooters better public transport system would reduce traffic emission help climate change make life better general maybe im thinking
see waymo think unpredictable hate distracting spinning camera let transition driverless begin next stop transition place poor road bad human driver weird road layout
beginning robot
vehicle comprehend right way law vehicle fair city severely faded lane travel fog line shoulder lane separator left turn lane etc
well great loss taxi industry million people loss job
bring india bit testing please
yes driverless car finally herein small section chandler arizona scalability key way important technology
veritasiums take av sponsored thought baised know im talking derek manufacturer approach solve autonomy far redundant term adaptability traffic vrus moreover sensor suite waymo isnt really driving helping avoiding collosion mean say waymo need map well labbled lane line traffic light position sensor suite primarily detection sour done enough ml lidar data nn approach based there change map data real world vehicle stop middle road like dumb machine doubt technology leap waymo great best imo correct way achieve autonomy maybe change title video waymos take av manufacturer different approach far ahead technologically title give idea unaware person
youre phoenix arizona absolutely snow ice little rain get back drive michigan dead winter
increased safety security lose freedom eventually human driving become illegal able go want society would give little liberty gain little security deserve neither lose benjamin franklin
late future bump krsones sound police rihannas man car pull make club close
attended lecture development ai traffice management sytems remember thinking much safer road would everyone vehicle managed computer knew vehicle going given time hadnt concidered collective experience vehicle tandem machine learning would quickly make system safer cool video
there one big caveat advantage list widespread rollout driverless car end video everything aside safety remove need parking lot thing like dont driverless car getting people accept driverless car one thing getting accept giving ownership vehicle making dependent ridesharing service order get around something different youll forgive im ready make dependent uber future driverless equivalent get around
im completely fine self driving car still want option drive
dont every person near road
amia dont want driving either drive reckless comment youtube
still ride horse day driverless car arent going take away driving fun theyll eventually separate driving fun everyone trying get somewhere safely
tho
anp driving fun autonomous vehicle share road also become safer le stressful
would sleep like baby first day get fully autonomous vehicle bring
well arizona weather nice whats going happen external radar camera snow raining dirt road condition rear camera becomes useless kilometer see lot video presentation smart system thats true every time used clear nice weather
new tec serving big brother
people moving wrong direction future transportation dont need road need something like mini train track ground like scifi video movie way dont need ai drive track public transport vehicle mini train pessangers capacity wasting time ai driver using electronic powered ground mini train come every minute km apart station know would take year spread newly everywhere one starting process development ai used track cant reach like place people dont usually travel daily ie jungle desert remote village etc think reply ai powered car better future ground mini train better future
much released western pennsylvania question answered video driven million mile job medical transport driver still good driver never accident rear ended red light distracted driver yet see age slowly taking toward bad driving habit however still accident free would feel better self driving auto sit driver seat override computer function believe auto driver override function best way get people accustomed computer driven auto however privacy never trust privacy computer lock communication auto computer may privacy think keep jeep
finally automobile manualmobiles forgotten
ton advantage driverless cab time destroying source income ton lot
autonomous vehicle eventually norm even though fun drive ideal accident human error still case emergency case
unless drive snowsnow storm never widely adopted entire video assumes potential waymo accident subset human driven accident disregard possibility new set accident software bug
next year lol ok elon musk
itd quite interesting see technology would work well marked environment let say countryside eastern europe road usually lined parking spot marked
police officer trying pull would car
wait self driving electric car self driving car standing still accident do mean car fault car overtakes bike make emergency brake biker hit car stille car fault thus need detail talking accident le many who fault
analogy elevator airplane autopilot landing really sold people become literally insane road prove car better average driver
driverless car please bring faster snd make car driverless specially work commute
course pilot important keep telling believe
maneuver autopilot cant attempt wont predict autopilot also killed hundred boeings poorly designed system crashed two max jet
pilot important plane come across situation cant handle eg qantas qf situation there pilot highly doubt anyone board would survive
airline company could replace human pilot automation would employee expensive computer thing pilot yet everything
present dilemma one hand everyone one get rid frustration higher blood pressure due people stupid risky manuevers hand since eliminate death road contribute population earth hahaha
plane may land automatically landing may least worry cat iiicapproach afterwards taxi damn thing gate zero visibility airplane taxi autopilot good question food thought hope
aircraft piloted human difficult emergency situation course autopilot going better record flying ideal condition
agree pretty much every argument pretty dark technological development saving available logistics company large corporation eg uber increase profit margin undeniable economic impact currently rely driving make living disasterous also driving fun
say trust autonomous car long car road also autonomous there snarky joke among software developer say matter good software preventing error humanity always provide better idiot yeah
arent many channel subscriber think underrated one brilliant video always
little q imo typical condition perhaps even worst condition av already would statistically safer issue simply liability responsibility nobody willing accept eithermostly legislator insurance companie accident inevitable although would le accident overall good everyone except perhaps responsible initially acceptance slow af regardless precedent set
one idea mind idk end coming

driverless car first flying car second
next step artificial road rage autonomous vehicle give virtual middle finger
going love artificial condition martha well haha
yes self driving way hurry regulation already dont driver license
imagine car religious person lane next pull cross show
id kind like sequel commenting cybersecurity vehicle one first thing thought started watching video around city population use service due malfunction codemalware unable get job possible economic damage could cause hostage taking passenger company
time alive
autonomous car drive smoothly rd world traffic rest assured time level ai would overtaken homo sapiens
derek idea think better driver apprehensive automated car bright guy would even suggest feel like straw man feel like would know better sponsorship digresstruth find comfort idea driver much loose expect alive end trip knowing driver expects alive end trip automated car software fails die company loos roughly k car replaced dead thats automated plane feel pilot die die assume dont want die theyll fly right computer life risk thus life lose let computer drive company attendee catch die die lol
thats awesome man still believe year away technology used frequently
isnt really city invest public transport
useri automated bus
definitely careful look size hit box
hahahahaha
bigger car actually safer
thejenspeeters aware
caused rain thank
matthew encina voice
really feel propagandistic
autonomous designated agent constantly approving ai action given ride partially shown video explained wonder hint hint waymo sponsorship control content waymo car sends back hun confliction asks agent say car passenger idea known literally year
clickbaitless wendover strange watch
man step front auto car gun car stop man point gun tell give money recourse give money get shot least take nap way cop shop
exactly autonomous car eliminate parking lot add green space cite still need park car either autonomous still need build maintain road car either autonomous autonomous car solution adding another line road new line come new car thing see outside window endless parking lot line highway already america live without car yeah let make better car try get grocery store suburb without car see expensive car rich never going solution
public perception problem self driving car moreso jerk live road rage swerving lane brake checking newer car use driver assist function there even whole genre youtube dedicated compilation prick car automated way revoke agressive driver licence wouldnt controversy safety everyone understands car well equipped aware react surroundings least automated elevator didnt contend directly badly driven elevator run cable nice thought course want make driving accessible people unable drive around symptom many flaw suburban transportation going retire majority human driving real pragmatic solution use larger scale public transport modern suburban town rediculously spaced inaccessible without car accommodation made car natural useful beautiful land paved giant parking lot babied maintenance big company like google simply interested selling product service like self driving car give short term illusion solution rolling sleeve true advocate sustainable efficient modern society consumer resistant change funding infrastructure expensive might well treat arthritis hard cast money end
make fully autonomous helicoptersdrones taxi service dunno werent done first far obstacle deal air
problem software although easy get done price hardware get entire new car price lidar top lot development done anyway cant wait see self driving car road great vid always
oh definitely suck widely available yet price going huge edit spelling mistake
lidar elon musk amused
death traffic light
fuel gas required back base human fill needed
much would cost upfront maintain also would really safer average consumer dont take care vehicle recommended maintenance reach u
reason use self driving car switch public transportation might good alternative american city dense city europe switch public transportation autonomous bicycle
bicyclist pedestrian take road listen malcom gladwells revisionist history podcast episode called love waymo
public transport dont need car transport
id rather option reliable functioning bus system
like private company developing uber replacment want functional public transit system need goverment soemthing agree reliable bus system would benifit people
live state thats pipe dream form public transport like bullet train thats power lobbying group state stop thing go way making money even progress
google taken money invested autonomous vehicle invested public transit system instead yeah absolutely couldve made reality theyre already lobbying local government make autonomous vehicle legal could lobby public transit instead real issue google interested control system social benefit system might really wanted reduce traffic save life save people money give people disability mobility option public transit would better every single way good humanity hogwash marketing
bus take directly custom point custom point b waymo desirable use autonomous vehicle many place bus wont go
thstair yes robust enough system journey possible single transfer requires le minute waiting become addicted convenient pointtopoint driving people idea much nicer hop frequent reliable fast bus train maybe walk block two addicted car north america
concern car computer get hacked need kind separate failsafe like big red stop button completely separated nonaccessible system monitor driving computer make sure working right
car driverless unless plan outlaw driving car never get humandriven vehicle road forget scenario right still car truck early th century driven daily reason think owner going willingly give freedom reason
worst driver really bad driver skill curve symmetrical possible people average guess overthought
ill used rounded value instead proposed video get point across easily people rated scale driving skill people people average would average would would people average know meant say median thats possible people median definition logic would self explanatory say people consider median trick wouldnt work anyway dont really point people think average mathematically correct unless ive made mistake still driving bit clearly say true people horrible driver part
lidar one car influence lidar another autonomous car
automatic car possible danger people fear unemployment
one trusting convolutional neural network still dont solution pixel attack
want one insurance
driverless car indian street year atleast
netherlands shifted many people using bicycle trip far fewer accident death many elderly able get around kid get school le use gas street quieter fewer parking lot useful space public space inviting pedestrian lot benefit get using le technology rather really thinking broadly
human better least one thing handling novel emergency situation doubt car trained identify car jackers take appropriate action honestly carjackers criminal could even choose target autonomous vehicle reason
autonomous vehicle dont ever get distracted wait first headline first car crash processor infected bitcoin mining virus
im afraid someone definitely going ruin party everyone selfish freak probably going get vandalized like public bike
amiwhatiam specially car maker dont bother infosec
video may trust self driving car
im watching doesnt talk tesla he lost credibility
find fascinating honestly would love see come sooner rather later cant drive often long moment due spinal injuriy sustained car crash year ago pain killer mess head much lose concentration stick within small limit catch uber
great stuff
people cant trust self driving also people sits honk instead break cutoff people without checking blind spot
lot safer idiot already road
could approach scientific way questioning engineer programmer instance raining whats procedure applied proceed hit pothole loses traction completely agree matter system way better human argument would great indepth wcs curiosity
slow transition next year fully driverless autonomous adoption city mediapublic perception driverless vehicle accurate make near immediate decision avoid fatal accident even mean causing accident save passenger tesla phantomghosted braking based ai prediction obstacle problematic car distracted driver following behind look forward eventually l take many year full adoption support public
show tesla failing video waymo vehicle failing driver tesla show one waymo video sponsored waymoo
question ask safety passenger people crazy use nefarious way thats next step imo
think many family destroyed driver falling asleep wheel drunk texting people dont want accept driverless car ego
flying car never thing unless theyre automatic theyll truly disastrous thing teleportation travel building private property steal thing force field werent also invented everyones home business world interrupt connection teleportation
selfdriving car question selfdriving car able replacesurpass human driving situation consider driving open highway clear day v bumper bumper interstate looking sun horizon pouring rain happen radar lidar respond hail blowing debris snow pulling trailer arent one million situation thing happen everyday depending live completely agree benefit cant wait day longer drive take time technology mature level great video usual
dont forget sponsored video
fully autonomous car cant operate outside training field tesla working almost done already many many time safer human driver circumstance
also lidar radar completely obsolete need vision like u everywhere time front tesla radar make thing worse better
read bit math u trillion mile driven year approximately million car accident kind harmless wont even cause significant property damage happen time frame per million mile driven approximately accident waymo million mile driven accident accident per million mile twice safe human driver also account fact u average includes thing like truck driver driving hundred mile day lonely back highway western u barely encounter car thus incredibly unlikely crash lowering collision average significantly compared urban suburban area waymo driving term capability would definitely say term selfdriving also note telsas selddriving option regulation purpose selfdriving scale provided essentially currently akin early waymo example people responsible driving needing assist car time time leaving much car getting distracted tesla want use feature keep eye road
ok please make real
oh he chandler az recognize building used live behind
bruh
yeah im getting car lol
cool driverless car watching many video reading city designed work without car make feel driverless car local maximum would really like world designed people without need car dont need worry car accident design city make car requirement
agree big part equation reducing number car road first place city mostly used bike public transportation imagine car could mostly intercity driving simpler anyways since thats basically cruise control highway could lot outskirt town pick car go road trip get back drop bike take public transport back house
people say autonomous driving year away mean actual self driving car drive road around country premapped zone narrow area city like google thats relatively easy compared telling car drive san diego san francisco
get freeway even easier av storing world road computer simple retrieving relevant map equally simple
ericdew know meant entering city dont mapped zone
fine dandy tech cutting edge wait theyre cutting cost trouble
great hope see futurethat said still car self driving bus added public transport would ideal
funny bring autopilot example improved safety also serf cautionary tale reliance tech invisible episode child magenta talk flight crash caused lack experience manual flying pilot spent career dependent auto pilot didnt build skill novel situation
shocked video talk self driving car without mentioning tesla
tesla selfdriving fancy driver assistance system tesla level waymo level
heaney tesla getting obsolete
would expect video sponsored waymo
heaney advantage disadvantage afaik waymo drive area fully mapped fsd also rather right turn left easier well safely tesla fsd beta drive everywhere follow shortest route instead one least left turn still make error need human confirmation go forward sometimes think tesla technology futureproof act like human handle unknown situation place improvise need software update become better waymo like robot need data data data stuck
drive autonomous vehicle cruise gm subsidiary every night san francisco testing efficacy ready quirkiness deal certain situation liken teenager starting drive teenager make inexperienced decision like knowing merge another lane usually sooner better sometimes seeing car distribution road might indicate later merge would efficacious difference every cruise car learns something pas knowledge car teenager may gain insight mom dad suggests something kid cant beat car learning maneuver tight spot knowledge braindumped another car end game better technology always happen end game liability whenever accident involving av almost always case nonav whether pedestrian another vehicle random object av never hit something unless something want hit even going hard people move av premium go fewer fewer people decide active driver happens make sense pay year insurance people get rid vehicle
car driver doesnt give f star rating
video people tend consider better computer driving yeah human also pretty superhuman thing milion year computer every single time h day day week reason start failing task reason die old age part wear start failing unlike organic maintenance machine simpler done machine use lem know turn human update brain software new trick
im someone get carsick easily even passenger watch road driver reading watching movie working minute make everyone need pull wait minute even driverless car likely wont stop watching everything additionally driving people make carsick regardless whether countersickness technique im curious driverless car make feel
im exicted optimistic self driving tech look scared hahahaha
everyone still need go lot different place time ideally still need driverless car car park parked would waste fuel drive back home go back pick admire tech dull boring future would never want one excitement device well cheaper manually driven car might temptation
concern stop hacker intentionally causing accident
sweet sweet google money obtained mostly extracting data user
trip arizona must hard hope got good rest
bus train love god please invest public infrastructure would infinitely better self driving car
tbh driverless tech pretty cool idea solution getting rid road death traffic parking lot stupid best solution reducing traffic dependence car public transit proven work many place europe look netherlands theyre making city pedestrian friendly easier access without need car country dont need car get work traffic lower far fewer fatality road u canada able take public transit anywhere wanted go reiterate driverless car cool arent solution road problem theyre bandaid need accessible public transit
good condition near ideal condition sure american sw city effectively flat weather uncommon selfdriving work far road well maintained much closer road normal northeast even city area like saw derek driven around rare far unusual road normal array confounding weather dont expect selfdriving meaningful u year yet software amazing far taken year achieve essentially low hanging fruit term driving
think need follow video exploring implication mass driverless vehicle reliably prioritize pedestrian bicyclist safety happens individual bicyclist pedestrian occupy whole lane traffic knowing arent contending human driver get angry distracted
question much car cost
say there thing level autonomy automobile anything le dangerous public road
one cant wait
perfect condition important caveat especially considering much earth still rural people say take year much easier ai accurate precise good condition extremely difficult train unexpected atypical condition thing like image interpreter really good object large data set still completely misread situation human would understand easily ex apple pen separately fine sticking apple full pen confusing one could argue technology could improve accelerated rate due advancement technique processing power would argue limit modernday style machine learning result heavily decreased return approach high level intelligence even company specializing like googlealphabet something major change rolled outside bigger city could well take year
anyone phone fail anyone computer crash well think trusting driverless car stupidest thing planet theyve making computer decade still cant keep crashing many people died trying get drive wire correct husband calling wife saying goodbye car going faster faster cant control driven learned anything older car could shut ignition key breeding idiot steer know zero car operates im stuck buying car way im buying driverless car ever im old enough hope ill dead crap eating bureaucrat make mandatory ill feel sorry young people wholl never enjoy pleasure driving car youll always passenger thats world still exists
weird getting video sponsored love video anyway
believe technology physic concerned machine better human everything certain thing happen autonomously would say make machine time machine build useless particularly everything
year big city would people saying car year away wouldnt inaccurate technological way live suburb bad road lot pothole im afraid car would love self driving become norm access thats long way away

suburb phoenix arizona phoenix doesnt suburb snobsdale tempe sure phoenix
much though could afford one
resist driverless car im car enthusiast love driving agree would make thing much safer would also make thing much safer actually teaching people drive comical easy get license u hope driverless car become normal dont try make self driving illegal
maybe since technology needed driverless car use electricity perhaps main power source entire car use electricity get fully environmental car
enjoy driving meditative get best thought behind steering wheel
many others foreseeable future technology proactive safety feature like emergency braking
im toyota pretty much drive turn thats even meditative manual driving get destination even mile later almost exhaustion opposed normal exhaustion based traffic idiot autonomous driving doesnt make driving worse make better
meditative describe operating ton machine going mph driverless car inevitable attentive lulled people killed often car
hope best thought based around going drive vehicle youre openly throwing distracted driving like good thing
need see heavy rain fog
oh goodness love channel
would trust vehicle autonomous mixture think bound problematic matter careful car everyone around even age technology distraction many people paying attention road rather fiddling phone even talking number pedestrian likewise distracted said imagine world car autonomouscongestion would thing past would probably able travel faster would glorious
realized veritasiums youtube logo look like default generated picture extra letter
uuhh horrible office
company need willing absorb responsibility crash consumer need trust company compromising essential way paying get caught think fight club ten year away legal precedent enough make full self driving good choice consumer meantime expect massive unexpected knock effect
waymo defeat must drive another year
meanwhile year ago zeno watch achilles race turtle
disclosure help support agent also robot
trust driverless car deploy city like nyc sf miami la vega city worst driver run issue consider oh columbus ohio place suck
hacker like learn hacking car
let rich person car drive house rob xd
already realm possibility car hacked kill people
mb
darthinsidious scary
theyre hacked already idk youre talking
im really dissapointed even considered fact andvetorial havent even touched topic system failure hacker bug glitch mean one thing autonomous driving clearly better another people programm way programming taught something bug appear human error
im looking forward street machine better following rule however im bit concerned happens one camera hardware stop work yes could happen regular car also would responsible accident happen cant imagine company willing take responsibility even rate globally could end costly
car waste space anyways petrol electric autonomous far efficient use train subway bus idea electric autonomous car solve traffic ridiculous way solve traffic reducing amount car road using public transit
pedestrian walked stationary vehicle talk distracted driving
look absolute shame humanity face made day reason
making selfdriving car really effective improving public transportation novelty dont see much point dont need want car unlike american tech designed
yes everyday humanerror based car accident accident stop traffic impede movement car pedestrian public transport use road accident occurs would want selfdriving vehicle youll order one like would order uber lyft taxi
densely populated area public transportation great people leaf many disabled people getting bus stop need go back difficult beyond people dont live densely populated area order make public transportation work youd alter entire way town even city set dont particularly love driving teenager lived mile town house street drove school every day kid even ive lived small city arent enough people enough bus stopstimes make convenient plan go bus stop either rush shopping take wait long time sure made largely american thats city designed differently choice much population density
many american city designed absolutely many american city designed much horizontal growth vertical growth sprawling suburb make public transportation really unviable people would end walk relatively large distance get public transportation stop adding stop doesnt work either since stop requires time potentially route money real guarantee return investment however self driving car could actually spur growth public transportation take self driving car local even city train station know automated ride end train suddenly train public transportation becomes much appealing american consumer
youre gon na find public transit live public absolutely plus way sort public transit pick drop go transport another member public would super difficult convince bus full people drive way town pick cruising bus stop bus stopif area would take forever assuming two three people every street wanted ride bus bus would need go ten stop full first stop people would bus hour cruising neighborhood sparsely populated mention bus would need many time day one ever take bus mean leave five hour early get doctor appointment bus doesnt run stop also going hour drive town really need catch pm wont arrive appointment oh need walk minute stop count leaving pm doctor appointment public transit great urban city everyone life urban area seems effective car summoned nearest car come get personally drive sure maybe need plan minute advance thats big step scheduling everything today around getting doctor oh dont miss bus stuck
think public transportation include selfdriving car especially cardependent north america outside city centre could take cab price bus would choose cab pick drop need dont cross reference address transit route figure transfer wait one big reason big bus need amortise paying driver cost diesel motor larger number passenger drivetrain efficient possibly sketchy driver running larger vehicle cheaper bunch smaller one inconvenience large bus fixed schedule risking proximity others unpleasantness disease etc fixed stop might start outweigh efficiency sure downtown core subway faster make lot sense come bus suburban even rural density maybe public transit robotaxis replace smaller bus le frequent route area bus minute frequency replaced passenger bus bunch robotaxis probably similar number ot people would get want go faster bus service robotaxis might expand reach public transit much wider today
cost autononous car statistically cheaper driver wont make sense
thought technology year away indian modifying technology suit world take least year
day driverless car drive india day robot become smart enough surpass human
subodhgarg nah programmed modified need data impossible worried adaptation bad traffic
india would make complete switch country anything else autonomous car would chance
india probably year maybe want sooner would develop india complicated continuously changing road network nearly impossible
thats misunderstanding qualification driverless tech simply exists cant afford space tourist exists
derek soon get driverless car like elevator joke dont trust elevator either forreal though thank like driving car hell car manual get choose gear get feel road im turning wheel hear exhaust purr hit vtec accord ill take machine kill
tesla standing front back waymo already level believe tesla waymo sure probably lidar radar etc map surroundings certainly many camera already help ai ml already solve self driving problem completely near future dont lidar radar eye im sure vehicle become perfect bunch camera need lidar radar pretty accurately map surroundings camera microphone gps transponder let car communicate tesla way better cooler go elon musk
good thing car something go wrong none complain
importantly something go wrong fix fix every mistake make safer
andscifi exactly
something go wrong manufacturer fault
something go wrong play national american sport called suethem
thats danger sometimes
pilot landing way tougher one better handled computer easier one also doable computer right
better conceal sensor think would great
isnt going take away job happen
one loop hole see problem hacker dont know hacker hacked car intentionally kill certain someone street hacker kept self unknown almost noway trackdown murderer annonymous yet still named behind good intention hacker tech defense better offense
need abolish autonomous car
question hacker attack coudnt send clif
thats already possible modern vehicle many car computer control engine brake even steering computer accessible number interface making possible could remotely attacked autonomous vehicle today dont many additional interface dont think car protocol communicate coordinate one another yet would easiest interface attack
biggest problem waymo rely highdefinition map work small area journey cant go outside boundary completely unpracticable keep worldwide highdefinition map updated available highdensity city general public tesla example however mature rely highdefinition map much practical deploy general public rely highdefinition map much difficult implement still take year get mature
whats scary isnt automated vehicle arent safeits human driver automated vehicle road trusted
phoenix profile exactly boston seattle snow rain feel like good testing water place people largely receptive idea automated vehicle know id nervous storm car couldnt see line road even plow
regarding safety complete option partnership human machine computer break whenever know need break would avoid accident prioritise convenience safety going lot car driving night owner sleep avoid traffic lot death due machine error happen people sill accept risk convenient way accept lack privacy would unthinkable decade ago eventually le risky hapoens today also way le risky year ago per mile traveled going take decade well year reach world london hasnt even accepted electric scooter think
think lot hesitation self driving car fear software bug hardware malfunction causing accident maybe video statistic frequency type error autonomous system could help promote self driving car
would great idea bussing service rather uber service fact carry people mean itll expensive itll take road space doesnt really solve problem pedestrian point view matter even traffic point view pedestrian cause car stop ripple onto rest car system accessible much cheaper system bus even train would benefit lower income family reduce traffic mention reducing carbon footprint fewer car road furthermore larger series bus line much easier track entire city self driving car could argue self driving car better bring directly destination wouldnt problem made city town easier navigate service within wide radius accessible single bus stop imagine much roadspace would huge system free accessible even self driving bus service even still individual self driving car service provided people disability far bus stop would much safer efficient probably lot cheaper take car road rather replacing regular car self driving car visualize difference entire warehouse self driving car v parking lot bus take le space transport amount people biggest issue suggested approach however would breakdown security breach bus break everyone bus delayed whereas car break one person affected depending circumstance security breach happens single bus could spell danger large number people arguably security breach single car could bad fear selfdriving aspect come play since always possible person ready cause trouble comfort home instead use force take control bus think whats easier track easier prevent experienced hacker found hole self driving system security guy going bus stealing despite think great technology impressive feat im excited see future seems expensive complicated solution systemic problem solved improving system transportation currently place
even autonomous vehicle good dont become reason accident human always blame vehicle accident personally think human cause accident obey rule vehicle
people proportional threat sense road death cut still take one child killed driverless car seen dangerous majority population
im hyped driverless car ive always freaked dangerous driving ill definitely buying one become publicly available
here something consider reason vehicle need many sensor much uncertainty environment importantly uncertainty caused human driver fleet autonomous communicating go driver road uncertainty greatly reduced driving even safer however used surveillance
imagine automatic car hackable
first cant compare car either air plane elevator elevator rail several sensor floor airplane self land airport filled sensor runway car behave safety parameter would put sensor road also plane radio beacon broadcast airplane information heading car would system
dont trust technology problem human driver road alongside people dont trust
one common concern driverless car sensor obstructed dont know respond
also help congestion car automated
want vechicles flick siren megaphone get anywhere want
ill get autonomous car long cheap
black mirror episode waiting happen feel like go wrong even concerning privacy
concerned privacy data collection video feed camera conspiracy theorist someone post ridiculous claim without evidence arent one
privacy tracking audio recording dossier youve telemetry there want one would even thing would need additional subscription service continue operate would car air update thats instant attack vector malware already shown vulnerability certain electric car killswitch remotely hacked security researcher
tracked phone already time youll still able recreational vehicle tour landscape eager privacy transport
could invasive device constantly announces location microphone camera certified closedsource software required specification technical requirement control entire ram probably carry everywhere pocket even paid
davidwuhrer nah use flip phone yeah know
problem isnt autonomous car mix autonomous car people shouldnt driving ive seen marked increase last year people run red light nearly unknown around see folk slow stop yellow stupidly common see two three four car blow red first second showing red light camera banned aggressive driver rail get autonomous car better driver agree far trouble well face people could use tech wont theyre stupid safe yet think theyre safest consider current antivaxx movement apply car thing id say driving plain much fun ban folk nobody mean ability drive porsche going want give sit back prius gumball machine top
agree people becoming worse driver due distraction cant remember last time took drive somewhere didnt see someone drift lane miss traffic sign hard brake etc freaking cell phone driving
autonomous vehicle crash due software error pay insurance car manufacturer software happens software get hacked someone point
backing entering driveway like taking landing imagine autopilot life
whether like think self driving vehicle new norm sooner rather later
better idea depending car first place
ooooooor support strong public transit strong bicycle infrastructure autonomous car supplement public transit higher fee regular mass transit folk disability get discount autonomous vehicle
problem perfect environment autonomous vehicle one without human one complete monitoring autonomous car pedastrians cyclist going strongest factor traffic many way interrupt system maybe work u lower population density inorganic infrastructure large rectangular road work traffic currently exists naples istanbul mumbai youd effectively ban pedastrians autonomous car work
landing plane easier driving constantly changing situation saying autonomous car need lot refinement test spot realistic derek said part world infrastructure
lidar work multiple car use unique frequency
beam pretty narrow wont much interference first place
rain snow ice fog flat tire construction engine issue etc future still year average consumer great southwestern u climate good weather known area really replace truck first
try india
technology innovation interesting
would abuse car block ram
safe software fails like matter time fail happens expected nothing fail proof
autonomous car never able ballet street shall never assume car always controlled machine
canadian need testing snowy slushy icy winter condition id feel comfortable road id say new driver
waiting use like average taxi
shame stick garbage driver
derek video sponsored waymo derek point video free give opinion without editorial control implication here minute ad veritasium channel
truly believe severely misjudged character
skynet kidding loved video
problem come lack privacy amount cameracs autonomous car
comment also talking tesla car thread tesla system operates level autonomy scale driver assist feature similar cruise control almost exclusively tesla selfdrive accident occurred driver something else system designed charge pedestrian fatality occurred tesla would prevented lidar system demonstrated inadequate roadside lighting determined cause
lived phoenix applied job help teach car got pretty far hiring process ala chosen really wanted job wouldve awesome
question multiple car using lidar area laser interfere sensor car receiver
going change friday night fast wont worry duis anddddd gas bill
wouldnt future presented end kind waste resource extent city invest car tbh safer sci fi taxi probably carry one two passenger could invest good reliable extended public transportation bike lane let car still dominate city addition city probably get people need sort transportation people wont car one autonomous car serve multiple people paying missing tax maintenance road
safe dont want dont need love driving
waymos answer elon advertising paid promotional product
im excited got car accident last week moron driving mph roundabout people incompetence imbecile dog suffering joy understanding
driverless car road technology full level self driving currently drive nice well marked map road bad rain snow construction even close yes level nearly looking waymo system seems like need nearly many people run compared regular taxi company accident injury death interesting see enough data becomes available yes get eventually driver road condition think year away
risk hacked mid drive thats something mentioned im curious likely scenario would
thing tesla hacked
richjefy aye thought much curious odds happening im afraid seems pretty slim
would interested see pull ambulance busy highway inner lane would probably nail still cant help little skeptical first haha
careless driver replaced driverless car still concern camera lidar whatever many system order car stop able drive car simulating several future given time much power requires computer inside faulty without car seizure affect mileage car concern climate change thing like dont think technology significant future save north american city future car rest world bike driverless car
arent car back
hope lot accident different whole motorcyclist one one without helmet hit style scenario
necessary condradiction unlikely thought median would impossible
totally game changing ultimate topiclove sir
probably spent time making car make smooth manouver
wasnt referring stop tho
im sure would work every vehicle road autonomous poorly maintained road bad driver wouldnt trust much
plot twist ghost driving car
better questionis waymo u eu chinese based company u eu based privately owned much controlling share chinese
derek look forward content usually great job fair giving whole picture feel video met standard quality weve come expect channel understand sponsored waymo address limitation lidar technology even mention world leader selfdriving space tesla vision approach seems like gross oversight waymos million mile laughable pittance compared billion realworld mile data tesla idea im talking lidar scalable solution self driving operate premapped area car essentially traveling rail compared tesla vision approach could take tesla drop anywhere planet even tesla never driven would drive successfully hugely important failing mention video selfdriving car feel like youre cutting approach built serve everyone living major city
dont trust technology enjoy driving driverless car might useful longer trip need drive back night bar replacing driving altogether nah
currently legal canadian law road regulation last checked winter current driver would believe year pas safety test car camera clearly tell difference black ice wet pavement see whats layer snow ready great white north winter
say goodbye motorsports decade one gave skill drive
transparency waymo owned google careful using anything owned google theyll definitely trying find youre going youre clothes youre wearing etc sell advertiser
one thing waymo drive white snow storm ice storm snow thick cant see road million mile driver experience year entire time ive accident one got hurt good average driver sure chauffeur license motorcycle endorsement way time road never good option vehicle never able drive snow covered road
waymo geofenced relies premapping tesla general autonomy solution work everywhere
derek people enjoy driving sport like cycling skating folk take car every weekend canyon might sound like conservative self driving car dont want replaced behind wheel enjoy
feel comfortable using autonomous car safer responsible driver safer average driver
point wouldnt prefer currently average driver instead take autonomous vehicle pose le threat
tomorrow everybody would selfdriving car would accident anymore easy
cant wait
guy custom mechanical keyboard sheeeesh
driverless car seem cool see computer vision view annotated camera view ai prediction thats little terrifying shouldnt compare training data directly human experience theyre directly comparable need million image train mldl stop sign time child know stop sign take human month driver ed take ai thousand hour training data level someone learner permit ethical trolly problem shouldnt even discussed car must pick hit hasnt driving safely enough condition present speed safe following distance minimum stopping distance etc come play automating flight million time easier there unpredictable fight pedestrian jumping there need image recognition visibility flight path predictable need relatively simple control loop highly doubt realm deep learning likely explicit algorithm safe automated car experience ml tell need serious groundbreaking stuff generalized selfdriving car telling self driving demo day relatively clear weather relatively slow well defined street
elevator bad comparison something automated safe using relay logic even level self driving car
bring th autonomous vehicle alreadyi want sleep wherever go achieve maximum sleep levelswhat future haha
death knell driving school upside driving test
dmvs sound like pro
nottoodistant future good thing car automated think ill take trip beach waymo pick waymo im sorry wrote insensitive tweet year ago guilty wrongthink permanently banned travel properly reeducated double plus good day problem isnt selfdriving car problem nightmare authoritarian control come soon selfdriving banned dont think happen paying attention cancel culture beginning whats coming thing orwell got wrong date
dont think machine care youre insensitive tweet like human registering system
richjefy right machine dont care government thats currently censoring people facebook twitter instagram etc implementing social score system china facebook tell government posted wrongthink social score lowered automatically added allowed travel list least brown shirt show escort reeducated big brother watching
easy solution using car primary method transportation society train space efficient far better environment even compared electric car safer economical promote better health affordable average person much convenient design city around walkability public transit car dont give freedom make slave expensive inconvenient method transportation
im fairly sure well never get live world fully autonomous traffic car driving car simply big thing get rid think enthusiast really think would get car able drive
omg lmfaoooo played old wendover production video dry voice he changed much since
ready wont long time year probably even soon waymo work phoenix spend countless hour mapping road incredible level detail work specific area phoenixbecause level mapping detail done risk assessment make sure operating road least risky plop car random cityit fail almost certainly maybe way cause accident way requires human intervention watch video systemscurrent autonomous car system issue discerning lot complex situation sensor work obscuredthere lot issue arent worked ive seen many video experienced autonomous car system try veer another lane even guard rail approaching two merging lane highway autonomous car definitely better driving ideal conditionsbut yet smart enough discern work complex situation require level critical thinking human good quickly world vehicle autonomousyes would much better vehicle would communicating world mix manual autonomous vehicle autonomous vehicle make far many mistake allowed drive
agree another problem sensor must working perfectly would happen bird poop sensor middle ride someone put lens f sensor see happens get middle fire hurricane lot debris could mess sensor snow like someone said
dont want autonomous car want autonomous public transportation
comparison others knock competition paying opinion video good destroying respect channel derek hope got alot money vaymo honestly happened scientific integrity sad day
he showing capability autonomous vehicle company sure
richjefy well mention mile driven key regulation car success fails mention company order magnitude mile vaymo title say self driving car specific vaymo displayed vid competition company crash link safety vaymo v company fails mention task hand vastly diffrent vaymo geolocked sandbox doesnt edge case others much greater go see disingenuous
car need bald pale white avatar suit
still dont feel comfortable step sort elevator
think average driver may right three time worse
want autonomous car
worried lack control tv show upload movie robot worrisome question good idea give much freedom andor giving freedom current state big tech shadow banning censorship make worrisome love tech sure lose freedom worth
last time early video driverless car werent already damn
ummmm traffic big difference road travel air traffic make strawman human better human argument deceitful jeez
opinionthe answer combine
would impossible run autodrive car india
tell cop car regular car sooooo could speed like normal people slow see cop lol
people understand difference autonomous vehicle safe autonomous vehicle
argument dilemma killing one person another becomes obsolete face clearly safer autonomous car absolutely wrong doesnt matter total number casualty moral decision made car manufacturer want reduce car fatality let stop driving altogether kill people one time future casualty absolute number irrelevant
never thought video self driving car could made without singular mention tesla know tesla first self driving car
vidoe sponsored waymo probably allowed mention tesla video
car great many dont like driving badly ive often wondered considering cost buying owning vehicle people dont like driving drive badly always afraid scared drive badly simple math would tell cab likely cost effective option without hassle personally enjoy driving would miss experience would miss terrible driver everywhere serious approach issuing driver license would help north america real test would go long way toward cutting accident keeping truly incompetent road
homeoffice joke aside thanks amazing
isnt next logical step transportation here mean humanity arent good enough something outright incapable engineer mean get good tool something heavy lever pulley flight built machine u fooled rock thinking u compressed portable form span le hundred year people bad driving period many factor cant handle navy worked aboard aircraft called p take landing two position plane assist pilot watching unexpected factor mean pilot copilot air traffic controller ground crew considered enough reasonable precaution le half number threat air ground mention there whole dimension used avoid trouble still took crew even know many others form enough reasonable precaution launch land aircraft case earth hand single person full responsibility managing vehicle one dangerous operating area earth vehicle like unmanned full sensor mics camera whatever else basically full flight crew condensed vehicle form cant account every factor made rock think u let put thinking rock work
side note good human driver drive way le mile similarly safe go show human brain vastly superior machine quantity side catch
uhuh train also driverless long til wayno work city car cost k
assume waynos busness modle replace uber taxi right train plublic transit like company developing self driving dosent mean cant also work improve plubic transport
jadjajeh meant train follow predetermined track waymo requires superdetailed heavily tested uptodate map
would buy driverless car car would sitting driveway nothing instead fully capable driving minus maintanence refuelingcharging dont intend sell guarunteed ride share way profitable largest expense right paying uber driver
dlifedt yeah car inefficient noisy safe destroying like ability town city produce nasty stuff make unhealthy unhappy kid netherlands happiest world dont see scenario autonomous car fixing problem need car need le bicycle walkable area thats improving life quality autonomous junction typical car dependency perspective absolute nightmare people live forced get around waymo wait thats actually great financial idea waymo city car costing money per driven kilometre bicycle walking people gain public money per kilometre
there lot driverless train today fact decade example paris take line many others first time ive used one must least year ago
first car fully autonomous even close level fully autonomous car level tesla car level limit couple city block like track cant go please waymo limited car shouldnt call something autonomous autonomous someone say make
human bias fast give think human characteristic see human think like see car going onto road like hunman already like
dont particular problem trusting driverless car enjoy driving time would prefer driverless car central london cause driving crap matter turning road robotic grid nice efficient ive many time ive driven nowhere particular ive never drive somewhere im completely lost check new place find way home thats something cant driverless car
mom said first started driving drive driver pedestrian make stupidest choice around sorry english lol
would car decide kill passanger save two child kill two child save paying customer also compare idiot road u driver ok biased sponsor sweet money
car also computer controlled allowed speed ever car could electronically limiting speed according gps location speed limit stop light car stop stop sign mean right car could taught obey stop speed limit sign based gps crossed map making tech like freedom much matter traffic fatality could cut designing car massive horsepower harsh angle front dont people weird point car tech people wanted safe car wouldnt like basically car oddly deadly many way dont need society humanity begin think must kind massive fraud insurance company something make sure people keep dying people really incapable judging risk way especially tech gee
comment made hour video posted wonder many people going watch video linked comment section every time autonomous vehicle accident
million road vehicle related death per year go autonomous vehicle structure worldwide thats million le death per year rate people born every year reducing death even positive given fast burning earth resource
ill say look pretty good waymo car stop short jogger skateboarder skateboarder stop fast enough caught guard waymos stop function data collected accident would ambiguous think mph parked obviously challenge working ballet analogy kind convinces want future
discovered world quite company working welcome vertasium channel used decent happened
ad waymo
rollercoasters used manual brake man car day think people trust computer system rollercoaster keep safe obviously bit different something rail open road feel lot safe around robot human
problem autonomous car autonomous car sharing road human driver prone error distraction road full nothing autonomous driver would perfectly safe would hardly ever crash human road different story autonomous car human scary
remember cgp grey talking auto well theyre learning faster effective human
called firefly wonder got cancelled early
well dont need uber driver yayy innovation also uber equivalent driver talking tiny self lap say bye bye job little one say bye bye tiny waving cluelesly bye bye job
yay video made happy
autonomous road look like pedestrian nightmare however imagine much youd spend infrastructure get pedestrian bike ect completely even landscape
partner risk losing sight insufficient driving anyways self driving car could best hope remain contributing member society
dangerous pain as
im really scared driving car ive never driven one constantly nightmare could faint think driving one seeing driving car driver even first minute cant stop shaking reeeaaally impressive fill fear ahaha
functional easily yr
im shocked one talking security
mean
think future walkable city beter pubilc transport insted car
car safe trust lock car burn aliveyup already happened remain hush itof course lot money made
waw hey need hand texas im
hit person helmet increase odds surviving
would almost safer drive bike without helmet youll hit car wear one
smart future seems near
glad made video thank
lead le total car electric indeed safer average driver unique kink funny elon crapping lidar way back waymo seems ahead thought still u regulatorsand thats lot rub year
okhay hacking
cop would need find new way get ticket quotacities would loose revenue stream
maybe would need le cop could help offset cost probably enough though im pro cop hate uncle beat one hell guy
one question always b chance accident case b kept accountable one kept accountable car b hacked kill people road accident
driverless car already yes know ive driving year see every day go
lol think get driverlessnot driverless car one driver something else driving
thedeadexpert
""
thedeadexpert maybe parked car
stefannoack simply drive ur car driver xd
autonomous car definitely place long car thing never going get point every car road autonomous eliminate parking lot like derek said many people like love car love drive love working car love driving car horsepower better driving fun stress relief getting car driving countryside sunday afternoon going road watching wildlife thing autonomous car cant really replace
know im probably minority think soon theyre safer human driver tbh isnt high enough bar clear driverless car road waiting mythical perfect driving car mean people die human error crash increase road safety benefit u
already
like driving motorsport general personally dont view driving something need want automated like human experience better journey go thats aspect think folk forgetting
wonder would future everything automated
im fine trusting car dont trust capitalist society inevitably cut corner save cost
mentioned poll part driverless vehicle dont trust still human element le unpredictable human road id trust computer maybe leery black box wonder waymo algorithm handle anything malicious like human driver aiming hit car sabotage
cool stuff great topic shame focused waymos approach specifically due sponsorship course meant real discussion scalability challenge face especially get bigger city cool tech seem good business one piece puzzle
video popular mechanic guy hacked car backseat started screwing real driver done safety people attack think tech promise people road prolly shouldnt allowed drive would make safer rest u many car coming wifi bluetooth usb port would need major security fix upgrade tested one
elevator driver aint gon na work gon na replace u bot employer ye
isnt like elevator driver anything press button werent driving elevator meaningful sense control process exactly whether paid employee people using lift thats crap analogy driverless car autopilot plane better one
stevieinselby derek may seem simpler one dimension yeah
stevieinselby early elevator automatically stop floor driver would control speed wherewhen would stop lining elevator floor building floor manually manually open inside outside door maybe right near end elevator driver elevator automation button see today probably already well end elevator driver
stevieinselby isnt true button early elevator elevator operator controlled speed
rocketman early elevator sure time question getting rid attendant came already button press
one thing america work next year make city compact walkable done
talk disadvantageslike accident made driverless carbecause video sponsered
agree technology would make better driver human think push back lack freedom involved
use philippine stop running
amazing thing watching derek back watching steering wheel turn much weve locked vision car think driverless vechicles enables entirely different option small form factor inner city vechicles specialized specific people convenient person pod location strict speed guideline could really open city street immensly course human well end cluttering world potential lol
simulation count experience
indication pedestrian car ie little ok cross wave parking lot wildlife live rural area drive home night constantly scanning treeline glowing eyeball usually see deer well advance slow avoid potential incident
really cool im gon na sad cant drive anymore im human really enjoy driving im sure lot people
car cant run india
like demo video also happens lower average traffic making technology look impressive im still skeptical
demo hundred car city derek happened film low trafic
rbin demo happy case demo
talking year love cant wait
lidar handle lidar vehicle area bouncing laser around
problem getting self driving car require option drive want like driving typically give long trip im tired
damned machine doesnt event put blinker make turn even autonomous machine violate law thats great news good start google bad smarta started autonomous driving movement made like bandit went prison moved le difficult application aviation
fun game car automatically drive kmh
sorry better average driver metric using computer able interpret human intent body language none testing done adverse condition argument great idea literally reinventing wheel rest world already train also vehicle react piece debris blow across road paper bag piece plywood human determine immediately autonomous vehicle far complicated engineering insures liability hear jeff goldblums voice saying scientist preoccupied whether could never stopped think whether
car refuelcharge
thumbnail driverless car save enough drive without seat belt
comment fascinating read people get kid born today bore kid story parent used manually drive car put liquid fuel others see list reason wont work think already achieved bus train point car autonomous function driving motorway fully automatic thatll transition start motorway uniform predictable also place driver error cause damage imagine car ownership didnt exist point didnt actually buy object instead subscribed transportation service every morning car arrived home ready take work went away wanted come home another arrived collect need go away family holiday three week book autonomous minivan
seems awesome love drive car especially manual transmission mean looking good
cant wait hear phrase back day take test get driver license
get driver licence pop chaffeur
imagine looking back shifting gearbox year like using vhs tape moment
likely year future advancement technology simply affordability
driver license probably still thing many situation want able control car
engineer doubt diesel gone anytime soon still think gearbox relevant forever
cant public transportation walkable city man
get guy million subscriber
work car theyre human wheel making correct assumption time sudden stop parking lot everybody would continued obvious guy cross road directly expected following car would able stop bicycle motorcycle would may seems slow bicycle enough cause internal bleeding also enfringe liberty many many level wolrd able drive insurance would become expensive continue aggrave difference poor rich cant wait see dense traffic area fill vehicle software feeding stupid assumption think exchange info coordinate yes theyll fair way there way luxury car manufacturer try mess system give advantage customer whole system fucked
motor vehicle commission hassle le police street acting macho reason vehicle aftermarket item making ridiculous amount noise yes pls
good improve technology like self driving car face unemployment driver might loose job
pick trade
mrlithium would learn coding probably year still
darthinsidious said fact see elevator driver lost job
noobplayz im denying rideshare worker job find new job demand labor reach postscarcity people need find work make living
need le car public transport car rich people
imagine automation happens someone invents teleportation thats need car train plane road public transportation change completely extremally unlikely utterly impossible
well lidar perform vehicle relying interfere many reflection visible
im curious deal human aspect driving example trying merge lane driver refuse yield enough space would give stay highway extra exit double back would jam forcing jerk finally yield dealing road rage people pulling without warning stopped lane traffic unobstructed one isnt really physical clue someone turn wheel toward lane would tough notice camera let alone interpret wont bother checking traffic would automated car proceed unobstructed lane case irrational driver illegal maneuver presume drive rational drive way there accident driver could fault many question
succeed india succeed anywhere
feel like comparison elevator airplane pretty obviously deficient car dont travel enclosed shaft without traffic plane human air traffic control support making decision little traffic dimension maneuver case emergency automobile environment order magnitude complex unpredictable faced elevator airplane even train think great driverless car lot farther video implies
reason didnt watch till end sponsoredsponsorship make youtube tv
work auto insurance wouldnt believe thing seen need self driving car immediately
delamain cyberpunk
bruh would trust autonomous car human stupidity driving time day hope technology come soon almost impossible country like india pakistan african country atleast another yearsi even kidding
many comment seem centered would never work city true phoenix az selected test site reliably clear weather geometric road grid initially google selfdrive car used satellite gps connection central server etc back wouldnt functioned manhattan ny however underpinning service become universal lidar system allows car autonomous within dynamic environment think system first pioneered oxford england able assist selfdrive test car navigate around university campus road narrow twisty large building filled pedestrian cyclist weather condition including fog want technology already release legally love freedom driving recently accept im injured continue well want freedom back want technology
car react flashing light emergency vehicle siren least siren used added help crowded situation lowish speed dont hear top anything faster kmh addition rarely run siren night visibility light much better people sleeping easy addition
know isnt first video channel like channel truth concerning theyre conflict interest covering topic sponsored said topic area
hey derek u think using lidar v using camera debate around selfdriving car
people acclimatize quickly went group friend nudist colony open day something scary millennium terrified minute everybody forgot nude became new normal
instead forgetting im nude forget im wearing watch occasionally look watch see indeed put
parking lot saw car pull parking spot kept moving back forth trying get spot like person hard time turn tesla without driver
biggest problem self driving car there still way self driving car want say dont trust people lol
driver hide seat
could drive place like india either cant blame damn car
thats proper sensor suite
job soo many cab driver become unemployed
need test technology extreme send india
here idea test better person human ai vehicle drive point b see get shortest time drive safest handle route ai may react sooner person pulling driveway compared human
happens someone hack car cause drive intooff something
hope hooooope ubiquitous time year old turn driving age remember back turned dad telling basically nightmare every night first year driving gosh dont blame either stupid stuff driving high school go waymo let get thing going
answered year poll car drive around blizzard montreal lot driver still cant ton accident every winter maybe driverless car possible nearly impeccable road quebec region world itll take bit time develop
impossible make autonomous driving good human driving either much worse much better similar first car goal would make fast fast horse
think india year away type tech
issue self driving car issue mixed road human driver something unexpected self driving car might able react accordingly thats part im skeptical know automation potentially get ive yet see convincing evidence really yet im also willing believe itll happen sooner expect
youre johnny cab
crazy talk car like human
unpopular opinion autonomous vehicle track racing would entertraining regular track racing
let lot people work driving taxi put work give google power exactly service
im disappointed derek really important video sponsor mean trust anything say video
shouldnt trust card need le car watch bike channel
press button tell support staff going talking car lot wondering would pick something youre talking accidental instruction
imagine police stop car conversation ai
thanks thanks
america need driver horrible
stuff like regulation cultural acceptance affordability think say year away car working
elevator driver example good u memory early elevator grandpa witnessed small child cut half front mother elevator accident used norm company try sell something someone ton money save ethic little concern
here problem love driving used race track younger still drive manual car drive uber mostly every day dont want driverless car understand future potentially safer human problem want drive completeness dont want drive elevator
oh already drive elevatorunless always someone else hit button
want see car deer jump road swerve hit deer
elevator onedimensional constrained motion cat iii autolandings require significant infrastructure airport extensive continuous training pilot atcs use system comparable driverless car particular cat iii autolandings airplane computer system say video onboard equipment useless without corresponding equipment airport
good condition technology currently functional happens condition change trip
wish gotten tesla instead monstrosity overengineered ridiculous approach selfdriving
vilevillian even good condition tesla doesnt autonomous driving couple horrible environment destroying lithium ion battery horrendously bad manufacturing process lazy quality control worse apple anticonsumer repair policy vehicle sure become modern day equivalent delorean vehicle look cool actually pretty bad made sleazy company created snake oil salesman
helenaofdetroit youre clearly harboring ill elon poisoned view ev tesla company hope able overcome bias future view company outside context ceo please also update knowledge battery production embarassingly date
vilevillian see amount truth could explain would lost bias tesla ev good day
weird derek get old like always watched noticed
secretive cam girl conspiracy like squirrel rick morty
autonomous vehicle hit grandma child f car speeding hitting someonesomething possible result slow
think driverless car inherently dangerous quite unreliable le optimal condition
imo think self driving car good thing enjoy driving way could enjoy act driving car road would totally board
hope would small tech city firm would agree restrict humandriven car would allow automated one think kind environment way thing go believe interaction automated car would learned like street sign knowledge would hard spread
fully driverless like dont need get rid fossil fuel
ive wrecked every car ive ever owned welcome technology
ok weird statement video like comparing traffic elevator isnt obvious incredibly complex car traffic airplane autopilot yes ever plane without pilot even two pilot plane argue scenario flying plane lot easier solve machine handling traffic autopilot plane even use machine learning algorithm predict future event machine learning specifically deep learning used autonomous driving system produce model inherently unpredictable might sometimes hard predict behaviour human driver least expect basic humanlike decision ai assume driverless car safer human controlled definitely enough data make statement dont even say case certainly proof anywhere waymos publication even state hard produce reliable statistic back statement say unethical replace car autonomous vehicle life could saved according logic would unethical remove driver autonomous vehicle know even safer driverless vehicle driverless vehicle driver backup system form autonomous driving allowed opinion sorry disagree many thing video comparison terrible least acknowledged sponsored video
like way mention one example bad landing human pilot automation amazing etc normal pilot mess landing totally forgets mention boeings max failure totally due automaton killed hundred people
regular people bad monitoring something automatic get bored start something else like reading email watching netflix trust people monitoring something almost automatic
pedestrian accident involved waymo completely stopped pedestrianbicyclist running thatsso telling human stupidity point blaming waymo would like blaming house drunk driver crashing lol really made stride safety though live run worked former driver gave dirt accident involving waymos almost always either due driver hitting like running red plowing werent watching traffic waymo driver still backup driver long time screwing like former driver said incident waymo driver fell asleep turned wheel deactivating automation rolled van thankfully passenger vehicle involved incident one disgruntled former employee tried cause wreck pulling front waymos slamming brake eventually got one hit police investigated found video footage dozen time tried failed ended jail really surprisingly good worst case thats happened lately funny one youtuber document waymo ride car get stuck due bad construction put cone way far apart vehicle got confused whether lane open closed support team back headquarters screwed instruction pushed vehicle made worse even case still involved human making decision screwing future car involves lot proper maintenance road uniform rule construction company road work seen really crappy company cant put barricade place right leave lane small traffic etc
amazing always people love driving normal car never dissappear imo
next video social medium sponsored myspace
cant wait car driver exception question even proper road infrastructure well snowy condition like montreal snow
need huge bubble top there g yet
could literally thing public transport lmao american talk thing like cant happen guy bus driver already like autonomous vehicle subway train tram ever heard anything want without focused christ insane car culture
guess depends call fullyautonomous many reason waymo operates little suburb
le minute youre talking whoevers next derek talk camera
camera next generation autonomous youtuber one day replace obsolete derek
real problem create way car clean ride publicly used people leaving behind nasty thing
here bit anyone disagrees bring counter argument anything autonomous likely mean designed software engineer even though driven computer end day computer programmed people exactly theyre programmed code algorithm flawscritical bug arent resolved easily result death people thats issue process dont personally believe there enough time bug resolved im saying someone developed software worked hardware people make mistake road engineer make mistake design
year car electric autonomous accident death accident population billion
look objection trepidation comment wonder ever managed survive point every objection comment section motivated one thing fear unknown
imagine didnt level city asphalt lane road parking lot put walking bicycle infrastructure didnt live hot concrete block poisonous fume plus car sits parking lot get back isnt driving around go pick someone else taxi spend lot time driving around moving anyone going wasteful polluting probably save life though pretty much desensitized car driving building doesnt even make news anymore
worry isnt happens make car drive good average person worry happens make car drive better every person insurance mandatory usa using car driven ai drive better average person objectively better wont take much every insurance company say want pay reasonable rate need drive autonomous car maybe feel like first breath never fresh air car objectively drive better person argue safety real argument
testing make minimal version car sensor go empty lot try crash car
big sorry cant trust software driving
im reminded top gear segment driverless car jeremy said im paraphrasing half plane crash caused pilot error remove pilot youd halve number air accident yes however would get plane pilot board basically car except car arent driven people made driving career theyre driven someone called keith keith dont know car able autonomous itll normal elevator today car dont trust driver like
dad pilot late auto landing see new technology work boeing hand ready flight wheel way late plane landed
flew australia uk late refueling stop singapore final approach pilot came made usual pre landing announcement instructed u sit back enjoy landing thats going
aw man youre telling plot airplane unrealistic never would guessed
though even today unusual crash attributed autopilot directly course autopilot usually work tended degree human sensor error involved process explaining autopilot involves pilot atc system conflict
there infinitely complex situation autonomous car deal flying easy computer straight forward minimal obstacle plane dont need change lane turn check lane clear attempting aerospace autopilot doesnt contend bumper bumper traffic stop light
charliedbrown true landing trickiest part flying computer could half century ago given moore law imagine capable today might even fit desk
like possibility human error self driving car responsibility shift driver developer also plane crash caused software error consequence error automated car may even worse human driver error eg bug cause car recognize obstacle million car get updated air night next day might million crash
perfectly possible people aboveaverage driver
hahahahahahaha
little derek doesnt exist cant hurt little derek thumbnail
please dont compare plane car car stop eg big red button train stop plane stop air even emergency maintain pretty high speed keep lift happening pilot highly trained people maintain awful lot information always ready emergency situation compare american driver licence btw id like see waymo car snowy winter day milano rush hour
video feel awfully mercenary wish bit evenhanded maybe take critical look counting sim time part cumulative experience car b delving little waymoreported circumstance incident stationary car stopped abruptly unusual location c least mention job particularly union job lost direct result technology yes part largerthornier question automation least mentioned counterbalance fawning new free time conversation waymo manager
think autonomous vehicle work perfectly vehicle autonomous whether human driver better human driver obviously worse whether computer handle
thats great video need driverless car save life time space could possibly
id curious see car reaction accident prone driver various collision course
interesting last vestige natural selection defeated im glad got see peak civilization result modern warfare medicine technology combine convert gene pool septic tank
people still use stickshift dont think ever convince people also driving fun dont use car go around business coming home
netherlands use public transportation reduce traffic comfortable commute work sleep bit use bike car prominent big problem like u almost everything car dependent
im excited able sleep check phone commute already public transport interesting engineering challenge ultimately unnecessary one north america stop designing everywhere drive
elevator driver go strike want raise
underrated comment
mean seriously single like cmon people
cool technology like driving skill learned
encountered driver elevator exactly told floor go pressed button upon arriving held door open sticking arm doorway holding door manual elevator surreal unneccesary liked thanked man politely went way one experience richer there least
im tesla driver hope every car autonomous soon possible human bad driving understand important call message maybe tiered thinking problem dont care kid safety first concern
interference driverless vehicle concern lidar concerned
chance much better computer driven car make better decision human there future chance flying car really want self driving car thing people stupid dangerous dimension there going lot dead people really fast

need make electric
veritasium time see imperial unit heart bleed say want true use useless scale measurement metric way like driverless car saying people dont understand excuse
car drive speed limit flow traffic
unless safely engage fornication back seat ready sale
wont work canadian winter cant even see road marking infrastructure would need place like wire embed road detect lane road marking arent visible even autonomous plane landing require huge amount infrastructure work il approach signal wind shear information etc autonomous system would work smaller airport lacking infrastructure
little mental test exact one use getting vehicle unfamiliar driver think people truly underestimate little interaction actually passenger would feel much safer driverless car literally half family member think formula driver
thought waymo v tesla approach self driving precision gps lidar v vision
waymo currently least stage self driving urban road extra sensor allow accurate data tesla dosent enough sensor car get full stage self driving least withought alot work way le information computer tp drive tesla
precision gps tesla work ok highway car travel speed arent random thing pop one lane drive city streetlight stop sign traffic cone feral animal stumbling drunk gps doesnt help
jadjajeh tend disagree think camera enough human drive pretty well camera pretty pathetic reaction speed distracted drunk information tesla million car road thats alot mile real information cant get simulation
ericdew tesla doesnt really use precision gps understanding certaily rely pretty much allin computer vision suggest listening one talk andrej head ai tesla elon fsd really powerful approach worth looking opinion
car wearing seat belt
technically arbitrarily large number people could average anything distribution imagine people equally good driving worse bringing average slightly people better average
path need pursue actively going post automotive world
wan na go stand front
real change going happen insurance rate human skyrocket cause accident passenger autonomous car provides cheaper insurance rate mass adoption happen
grandpa longer recognize family member face poor vision gotten doctor keep clearing drive even tell drive sneak id change driverless car assure doesnt kill someone
full technology disturbs high connectivity vehicle know people connected time time could go far term privacy security imagine somebody want harm case need skilled hacking sabotage vehicle therefore hope manufacture separate driving software way shouldnt happen
autonomous vehicle great much safer want make significant dent road fatality need government exchange program heavily incentivise people trade upgrade old car also probably make test get driver license much tougher require people requalify every year strongly suspect itll long time theyre allowed road without qualified driver behind wheel next year probably lot job created driver escort chauffeur people hold valid license paid ride front car case take whatever reason itll great way people say get free ride city well make buck one development really think overdue ability car communicate one another beyond blasting horn would useful human driver signal would virtually eliminate pile ups imagine car knew several second car ahead slammed break obviously benefit autonomous car able tell theyre negotiate enormous great would drove car park immediately told car empty space get reserved great book scott meyer called run program set near future talk different driverless car different personality like bmws aggressive overtaking lane change found idea really interesting something id considered course he right even given requirement obey local traffic regulation different manufacturer use different software different algorithm ai used even individual car learn different habit depending kind driving often car used tearing autobahn likely learn behave quite differently one spends life stuck london traffic
ive huge fan fully autonomous vehicle live place thats supposedly good bus dont drive still take long time get everywhere expensive take cab uber could fully autonomous car could get stuff need get done done time life
legally blind person im extremely excited technology however skeptical testing done easiest place possible drive phoenix suberbs live boston tell someone lived place skill needed drive safely az nowhere near needed people dont call massachusetts driver massholes nothing dont get started pedestrian walk whenever feel like think road cyclist run every single red light want self driving car badly give freedom ive never think testing need completed many city technology ready despite wanting badly everyones wellbeing please come boston last
irony autonomous car becoming reality shift working home longer needing commute go figure
aha derek said impossible measure speed light trust car socalled laser tell something two meter away actually two meter away check mate
someone car accident kid afraid driving passenger look good
use doesnt mean ready
still aint gon na ride even get
think elderly able remain independent wont need able drive
maan make sad know infrestructure country would take like year built good enough infrestructure make driverless car feasible
people sure drive better robot apollo astronaut allowed fly craft dangerous let ape drive
ok car future need bike an pedestrian living close public transport way safer car urban area etc make affordable sustainable life
tesla use autopilot
infomercial nothing hopefully ad pay future solid content
""
never really mentioned probably asumed everyone know one driver learns something learn human cant really even modern day medium wont reach everyone somemost lesson learn driving wont even make medium
cant wait get rid car bought k mile dont use time eliminate human driver vehicle truck train car etc hate commute work two hour day get vehicle sleep catch work read book enjoy scenery something dont get driver cgp grey one video show tap break freeway profound ripple affect bring driverless car
im going add controversial believe definitely autonomous selfdriving car adopted universally large number would reduce number car accident vehicular accident matter almost nil current trend today number accident per kilometre per car autonomous car waaaay le regular car driven human literally one two among swarm random car imagine like street would obviously coordinate accident even traffic jam delay fuel consumption would reduce drastically computer always able coordinate compute efficient way get b contribution randomness traffic issue would side saying computer better driver human definitely drive better many scenario im saying computer coordinate better herd always manually take need ever like emergency youre special rush wan na catchup someone like airplane please dont consider unsafe even airplane would much much deadlier inefficient managed human autopilot abstracted customer feel safe today
im cant wait live city isnt designed traffic real issue netdatasecurity legislation need tight enough protect consumer privacy want wont get hope though
think hard use automatic car people driving cuz human action weird driving think human mind understand take quick reaction
lot sayi understand video sponsored waymo approach veryyyy costly scalable flexible one big reason behind expensive cost lidar definitely come time major concern bigger issue reliance hd map scalable reliance hd map also mean flexible say spot previously empty construction huge problem machine learning long tail rare event simply cant get edge case train model unless huge fleet car diverse condition sending feedback quite certain autonomous car become commonplace waymo isnt going leader winner segment likely tesla tesla might overoptimistic promise rate improvement fleet size simply unparalled give tremendous advantage
self driving car one thing selfdriving road system completely another dont waste processing power every vehicle car communicate one another road
waymo promising year work limited area perfect visibility premapped think tesla better chance solving lidar based system
buts never gona work india indian road complete mess
happens lidar beam one car hit lidar sensor another car first car see beam reflected auto pulling hears siren sound like loop hole waiting exploted dont fear technology driverless car fear motif peoplecorporations control software run car
im legitimately worse driver pandemic spent much time driving im practice would love robotaxi take point b think option drive manually fun designated highway track would fun want go downtown micromanage drinking experience id like second glass wine car take home safely
wan na know stand indian road
fun stuff except driver
self driving car honestly feel like wrong solution problem trying solve guess another day american understanding public transport
yeah every american watch bike channel
weird hear serious mention asiana flight
interesting choice given investigation concluded overreliance automation part case crash
sake full disclosure tell u required andor required show talk regarding tesla
laugh hard indian road software car break yes still driver lift
sensor get dirty faulty
wonder taxi driver thinking watching
speaking someone degree ai b ride bicycle around new york city primary mode transportation terrified prospect driverless car given current state technology computer vision particular still pretty sus far im concerned zero doubt aidriven car handle normal driving condition better typical human doubt ability handle unusual unexpected situation say bicyclist road ahead swerving avoid pothole broken traffic light road construction animal darting across road taxi driver ever general vicinity thing might unusual isolation youd hard pressed drive anywhere couple minute without encountering something ordinary youd show driverless car flawlessly handling condition mentioned time row id ever trust one heck maybe id definitely want see hard evidence
cant wait see dash cam video idiot road raging driverless car
hate people hate technology science
past review car ive heard great physic driving brake accelerate turn really well awful actual driver would make human driver curse decision making experience
brilliant hate normal driver ill glad see replaced
""
definitely need tech like autonomous car electric car interconnectingvehicles communicating plus massive rollout public mass transit technology get hand improve trafficour presence inaround world get around city plus also city town better highspeed railultrahighspeed rail infrastructure cantwont able drive distance excited future
suppose opinion selfdriving car influenced video tesla vehicle showed dangerous behavior part ai perhaps waymo advanced system know tesla famously eschews lidar could problem visiononly system become sophisticated regardless hope future hold something like fleet selfdriving car riding around ready called id happily get rid car throw payment insurance premium subscription service dont like driving much live world make choice drive quite difficult know waited thirty learn drive living area without remotely high quality public transportation
imagine future without car cant imagine way get doesnt involve tremendous amount money disruption
hmm problem car cant see working country outside largest city road state driven driverless car sure hope thing improve future edit welp silly address min video
think one thing wasnt mentioned video security car term prone malwares program interrupting normal driving program think big issue later problematic cause several attempt steal even abuse something someone considered carefully
already see future everyone us selfdriving car gon na annoying prankster faking siren noise force stop car unless tech doesnt change
doesnt sound legal honestly though amount data car record wonder hard itd file charge people
varenroth true ive already seen people thing border assault pas prank clout id imagine would case
tanishjain yeah guy played prank involving faking passing middle intersection didnt stop getting charged end day id rather car play safe though country thing like flashing light specific frequency get signal go green emergency vehicle think gon na sound siren end
gas
would deal winter weather
coming call drderek whaddup elon know viralizing autonomous vehicle better one right
never got driving license
im ready mandatory autonomous vehicle
anyone else concerned cyberterrorism
forgot mention waymo car dont function placed unmapped road
health wealth ecology stupid
owning car influence third party luxory baned imagine new problem making public transportation individual moving space bad idea selfish antisocial name safety live little dont plant
trolley problem simple problem autonomous vehicle assume vehicle choose hitting something also stop avoid collision always choose safest route likely avoid problem first place

selfdriving car suitable carcentric environment humancentric environment mixed traffic pedestrian bicycle rider theyre good solution would need infrastructure public transport
thats great cant wait tech government
itd interesting see happens witness crime action etc maybe person see something happen hit help
wonder autonomous car would deal pulling trailer started fishtail could correct back point needed park space would find one trailer attached maybe itll like apple product buy whole new trailer connect lol
honestly dont remotely expect human better pretty much always expect machine better especially tested proven however dont think everything automated time human need want thing think everything automated option ie want self driving car also want option drive manually want remotely think im safer driver enjoy driving time road emptytraffic low
know sponsored video id love see cover competitor field
reduce traffic actually study show car driving ride empty going significantly add car road make traffic worse driverless car cool sustainable solution need fewer car
yeah car occupy much space need public transport space car electric
link study talking doesnt make much sense well amount car road given point waaayyy le car sit parked hour week meaning parking garage become le le needed time parking lot general size reduced greatly trip car find someone else drive think right selfdriving car wont reduce traffic dont think worsen
network self driving car drive far pick next rider
study also show people also going live away travel thing road lack driver fatigue
also public transport reduces much traffic think bus people say car mostly person make time le car road mentioning giving pedestrian space walk make people use car mile le km im europa use metric system public transport pedestrian way le car road also reduce trafic lot add bicycle mix basically tout need car long triproad trip live everyday life without using car
human act based prior experience base judgement exactly dont think question getting accustomed autonomous technology think question generation thatll born raised consumer level next generation make society think technology become common everyday encounter
savest vehicle provide much information human handle easy
might put lot taxi driver business unless taxi owner able send car work shift whilst stayed home collecting tariff

wow actual autopilot unlike tesla false advertisement
car run flawlessly car cant stop electrical fault whats going different autonomous vehicle make reliable auto industry building sensor everything era
mean traffic light car communicate predict decide car go first car go exciting would see car stopping traffic light crossing passing one another edit im assuming padestrians bridge cross pas
like driving much sad mostly likely wont future
human good inventing following order
happens construction road example frequently used road double lane construction traffic go one direction bypassed one lane opposite double lane road kind roadwork uncommon dont see modern selfdriving car could drive kind condition
people speeding go bonneville salt flat drive mph one direction period time stop turn around mph way die point speed doesnt kill anyone reference car change velocity difference matter cause u say thing regard car cause unintended consequence get wrong answer deal problem solve non existent problem create new problem roundabout versus intersection good example
wait day driverless car fully implemented issue anxiety driving something stress quite easily actually drive would mean could travel much easily
bad video sponsored otherwise id actually trust assume nitpicking manipulating even youtubers seem trustworthy shill ad sponsorship show bought
sad see many youtubers caring truth science refocus go away sell first big dissapointment learned destin actually high budget series ad u military derek also basically make high production value lifeless corporate ad know consensus level reality noit achievable year zero critical analysis zero attention information see tesla disengagement video example zero search truth
hope rogue taxi quest cyberpunk arrives soon real life
veritasium missed lot subject matter plus conclusion seemed notably biased
tell exactly derek missed eg risk hacker
think technology driverless car good highway driving much city driving
car driven software wont hacker able take full control car thats got ta suck
million dead someone blame legally easier deal million dead unclear blame remember death impaired driver distracted fatigued computer get distracted impared get fatigued
normal situation snow storm heavy rain driverless car saver question car react exceptional situation like accident ahead people street car front making mistake taking right way bursting tire take car different city work good
driverless car exist doesnt mean already still accessible people right accesible getting ride spaceship possible people dont access wont long time
malcolm gladwell interesting view waymo future autonomous vehicle first episode season podcast revisionist history well worth listen
like rocket automated start right
big question waymo us hd map would limit mapped area drive fully autonomous anyone know
think one big stumbling block least u people arent going want give owning car much like electric vehicle price going factor also mean wont able get rid parking lot reduce traffic congestion switching driverless vehicle
math id love explore let please make assumption accident involve driver one le distracted influence higher skilled modeling record im technology optimist bring driver le curious
imagine car autonomous want friend feel little bump run front car know stop
exactly kid playing screw
vibrant neighborhood people try um approach car stopping stoplight stop sign car deal potentially racist incident
importantly large scale rollout autonomous vehicle must populated autonomous electric vehicle past point needing fossil fuel vehicle general public use
people waste much lifetime driving
think would really help adoption increase trust would open system people could compare ai offer small compensation people willing put vehicle monitor thing let drive theyre used driving compare actual result even best driver recognize computer respond faster accurately aware thing personally cant wait selfdriving car norm still want drive manually time time luxury joy riding rather daily commute travel biggest hurdle right mentioned definitely infrastructure live colorado spring pretty big city due weather condition road continuous repair change lot indicator would provide ambiguous feedback selfdriving vehicle would enough information least thats understanding talking people city vehicle selfdriving capability combine new road suburb arent google map publicly accessible map lot left go id really curious see advent solar roadway could potentially improve autonomous vehicle improving infrastructure creating dynamic roadway easier interpret would also allow potential vehicle roadway communication back opposed vehicle vehicle communication plus think solar roadway could use lot attention especially today climate pun intended
people resist enjoy breaking law especially speeding
important honest question mitigation fatality control much give machine
people thinking better computer funny story realm computer vision deep learning first leap success imagenet reaching near accuracy researcher still wanted top thought human accuracy object recognition still lot room meaningful improvement later study found human score accuracy dataset retaining attention large volume image also case hard properly label word become clear accuracy object recognition would simple overfitting instead actual improvement since imagenet grown significantly added complex criterion assessing algorithm perfomance base problem considered effectively solved use deep neural network trained large corpus image starting point training model specific problem including object detection autonomous driving etc
im absolutely pro driverless vehicle way forward video bordering advert almost discussion negative even positive outweigh negative least raise discus please one obvious one think car car develop fault often hardware software dont bat eyelid pc phone tablet whatever device freeze crash lot serious driverless car whats redundancy tmr completely separate incredibly robust monitoring system override driving system safely bring car halt unlock door etc fault misbehavior detected driverless vehicle average safer human driver wonderful starting point good enough cant pretty much perfect face wrath public new medium something go wrong someone dy possibility human driver may avoided better average wont cut would love look forward day driverless vehicle outnumber human controlled one honestly think lifetime task overcoming safety barrier entry also cost resistance loony think end like luxury utilised rich powerful good mankind
would still like sit driver seat even self driving car
im pretty sure driver seat thing past autonomous vehicle thing
car driver seat cant passenger face
google shill
cut traffic could play siren sound watch autonomous vehicle make way
know funny documentary computer look u video look like year
personally think car road besides emergency service vehicle autonomous car enthusiast suck bring car track maybe could certain road still allow regular vehicle best world would obviously huge financial incentive switch autonomous car imagine world car road electric autonomous space filled parking space filled park nature sadly dont think big car manufacturer keen switch making autonomous vehicle anytime soon tesla probably top one leading charge semiautonomous car think lot manufacturer try replicate dont think theyll go fullyautonomous car anytime soon
imagine car road synchronizing literally accident
oslo traffic death narrow road reducing speed investing public transport
well isnt going strike driver time soon difference
iirc recent video brought counterpoint whole ai driver utopia solution car think future interesting there lot place go
driverless car electric car car occupy space make people life harder watch bike channel
think road safer vehicle autonomous help traffic jam looking tech vehicle little wonder tesla cant get full selfdriving right yet
amount time brainless person almost taken road stupendous
true question allowed driving
number time
happens india ta ra ra ra
life wasnt meant risk free driving car enjoyable even therapeutic see us disabled taxi dont want forced autonomous car
wait waymo car make hard stop reason rear end tell bad human driver
hate statistic like people say people think theyre better average x people must dumb lol thats impossible average doesnt mean half people half thats incredibly statistically unlikely bad driver way worse small percentage bad driver bring average aggressive percentage people would better average example student scored test guess student better average score correct believe derek say think always wonder anyone else stats actually thought dont get wrong people overestimate ability thats true isnt proven strictly simple statistic like one stated
think crucial really taking advantage connecting seemlessly public transportation system make route fluid cybersecurity pretty important aspect well would presume
pandemic saw bunch waymo around bay area san francisco thought testing software guess actually driving never noticed wasnt driver guess didnt bother look ill sure pay attention next time see one freeway
dont trust fully automated car people car driving dont trust
anyone know spectrum analyzer doesnt cost measure ghz radar frequency car use navigate
actually look like larry page
well fun whatsoever speed control nothing
anxiety really kicking got inside would feel control
im commercial driver sport car enthusiast tell observation vast majority people suck driving allowed behind wheel blow mind easy get license little incentive real driver education training compound lack theoretical knowledge swear safety feature driving aid made people pay le attention theyre put le respect multi thousand pound steel death machine piloting bring robotsand universal basic income
dumb issue car dumb europe crazy thing called rail public transport honestly idea america hasnt collapsed
gon na honest disagree lot point made video especially point plane essentially fly autopilot even landing thats actually correct cat iii limitation specific requirement airport simply couldnt retrofitted cat iii capability due geometry terrain airport making point likewise way autonomous driving could reality whole infrastructure city made friendly autonomous car countless example waymo car stuck disabled middle street blocking traffic autonomous car must successful time otherwise failure accident blocking traffic also argument autonomous car safer le fatality compared human might true car road autonomous fatality might well increase occupy road operating different instinct finally real motive develop technology company never safety movement people disability etc believe actually minimize future expense hiring worker mean solving problem thats really problem create future problem
offroading driverless car would interesting

ive always loved point actually ethically le sound bring driverless car onto road many life theyll save virtue driven fallible person im stupidly excited car become reality dominate road
driverless ambulance car ready public
im gon na report back drive go feel video end
say though
driverless elevator guided one dimensional movement constant speed interaction vehicle driverless car comparison flawed air traffic urban traffic however good automated system shown improve safety
nothing happy
owning nothing old tax optimisation scheme
davidwuhrer make sure remember bread line ya
think wasted value car spend time parked imagine future wont able drive car wont able truly nothing happy scary
apice obviously tell youngster person think car valuable moving people like car variety different reason quite honest doubt driver license doubt le year
currently huh first quoting video quote literally video say scary know theyre gon na use excuse future make u car way would hate love car love driving license year got wrong
self driving car great public transportation bus taxi etc still enjoy driving sad see disappear
part world road arent maintained driver dont necessarily maintain lane feel like opposite road u well maintained provide correct environment driverless car
part world invest thier infrastructure spending public transport car solution place car culture heavily engrained probably always area driverless car impractical
want know smooth steering sudden turn
problem dont want car drive want drive car
excellent million unemployed driver
thing technology never perfect flawless true human influence sleepy distracted machine software fail various reason well calculation faulty unexpected error shutdown whatever blame youre driving autonomous vehicle like extremely unlikely impossible scenario happens also feel like humas usually better abstract unexpected scenario road autonomous car might programmed take account dont get wrong think driverless car future arent yet ideal scenario driverless car road eliminating human factor much possible take time achieve might bumpy road
many feel likecame objectivity
every car became autonomous tomorrow everything would work level unpredictability human unpredictable driver pedestrian etc
dont know felt bad car parking lot poor soul got scared
cat iii autoland take huge amount infrastructure beyond even instrument landing system used help human land make trip nearest airport find much runway infrastructure cost im selfdriving car point human driven car super awesome aircraft order magnitude expensive sophisticated safe dont compare car discussion root cause accident hurry autonomous car arent going quicker getting people hurry choose safer faster isnt going easy
think answered question beginning video driverless car functional ready yet also driverless car great condition perfect road line happens condition arent perfect car dont well give human road without lane marking pretty decent sticking lane let take one lane direction without street parking residential road europe dont road marking everyone generally rather easily capable sticking lane driverless car point use curb curbline road dont raised curb line marked road different color brick defines roadsparking area end sidewalk begin parked car figure lane think best way convince people driverless car work take perfect condition road far perfect someone see driverless car drive type road every day people easily accept whats point driverless car able perfectly drive highway closest highway house minute drive away
hoping current car last long enough next car wont even driver wheel dont even think tech main issue anymore bringing mass think people liking change liking control elevator comparison great
probably isnt going happen current ai technique well put bluntly worst kind ai become profitable domain pretty much dried self driving car order truly work going require return gofai going mean training least generation researcher gear back economics killed domain first place nnmldl became popular could utilize cheap easily scaled hardware could compensate poor performance returning gofai mean developing new hardware scratch business consumer application company people knew build stuff gone college stopped teaching gon na tough field rebuild
would think driverless car result shared carspace work poorly shared bicicles scooter tragedy common kick noone cleaning car let add camera fix problem
shot fired dash cam video channel
exactly incomplete selfdriving technology may extremely unlikely control vehicle something human driver identify avoid properly paying attention mph limit never driven around chicago get run road going le mph limit also stationary factor state mean didnt know stopped human opportunity react avoid stop hope vehicle miss
okay derek either intentionally omitted wasnt aware find hard believe wasnt waymo uber also testing autonomous car tempe az autonomous car hit kill pedestrian look elaine herzberg yes could argue fault walking traffic feel intentionally including story coming age story technology intellectually dishonest story isnt waymo self driving autonomous car cherry picking driving data one company fails tell whole story
goal reduce traffic feel like investing public transport would better would also safer way le car road especially combine driverless tech public transport
still feel little nervous closed metal box speeding multistorey vertical chasm indirect control fate
want see operating place like winnipeg january february
yeah good luck getting anywhere
honestly answer dont want spend time driving work id rather something fun sleep already exists public transport public transport also significantly safer often time safer personal vehicle cheaper reduces traffic better environment dont see driverless car ever becoming widespread country luxury even without taking account problem bad road bad driver road sad would nice expand technology public transport well could improve efficiency safety p died inside little seeing derek ride around alone huge car id rather see car like firefly instead monstrosity
love turn im saying right partially self driving car bad idea elon nothing beyond big benefit come car self driving predictable self driving car struggle deal random human driver sorry taxi driver cyclist
dont know sponsorship video seems almost positive like problem autonomous car fine positive view thing seems le credible critical question asked know thing autonomous car would interesting also get view cant yet feasible last remaining problem autonomous car solved within next ten year wait longer
autonomous vehicle improve society every aspect
driverless car dont frighten fact time experience decision making bit unsettling computer even century old already getting much better human many thing
country would trust ai taxi got scammed much
question road would mostly driverless car wouldnt lidar car affect measurement car
wow future one
human driver slammed car robot couldnt worse
cant wait everyday reality question well technology transition bigger vehicle like semi dump truck also deal displaced workforce
trained detour following construction worker police officer direction
serious question though happens something break malfunction like engine light come normal break malfunction car stop youre forced call tow service reroute handbrake drive nearest repair shop expensive replacement part radar device first delicate sustain rock flying wheel driving behind truck transporting gravel make winter condition road rock damage windshield much le fragile exterior radar winter radar get sprayed dirt top device expensive hell probably worth car mileage
need already cant afford freakin car let add crap drive price since election used car gone cant afford used car right want little old pickup live rural area want able go hike fish dont live fancy suburb also want something work live fantasy world rich here reality check cant afford anything k hard fit budget right unless get better carolla something
problem come orange cone blocking right turn lane intersection pedestrian hanging intersection intention crossing itll wait kingdom come
kid saw movie cant believe
experience mean memory vehicle may hr belt end credibility lie present state algorithm use data make decision make road safer moment havent reached level artificialintelligence till average human safer bet process information meaningful way much faster system may get eventually thats yet description assumption machine use sensor data efficient way possible true
real question iscan drift though
think driverless car possible successfully navigate small gallis india similar road
trust car park nope
im passionate car driving really dont like fast car changing worst situation cant disagree alot people cant drive save life
agree people saying autonomous car wrong answer big problem autonomous vehicle would still take lot space use lot money build maintain highway better invest public transportation cycling making city walkable efficient sustainable cheaper also contributes social liveable city
survey show people believe average driver think got man realised cracked
mean might true average driver bad small number brings average way talking median
true even easy make case say people driving ability unit two people driving ability almost people average driving ability two guy take average
sound like one hookup apps woman rate men average always good laugh
well people average depending shitty shitty driver
someone tell learn drive
feel anyone brand ambassador driverless car derek
mistake impossible machine make cmon anyone worked computer tell one ever confident software better human probably never make certain mistake course itll le frequent tesla model yesterday driver showing autonomous driving part know level automation people wary full autonomous driving car section lot car parked along one side road making car going direction straddle white line fairly common live intervene tesla tried turn quite sharply parked car try get back right side line literally tried drive car say machine cant make mistake whilst also showing video car driving straight stationary lorry motorway mistake machine making plus landing example order magnitude easier driving there far fewer variablesother vehicle consider better signagesystems automous landing system generally require large amount infrastructure airfield guide far fewer interactionschances collision given amount time
yeah idk airplane real example aircraft control pitch roll yaw given exact position inch il radio system airport runway known exact position length condition
girl brazilian something way say word make wonder
people indeed good driving lol still want option drive feel like driving though
dark development see coming autonomous car becoming much safer becomes illegal drive huge loss joy culture internet go one day human dont right capability transport
ironic high rate humancaused accident conditioned u assume driving must always fundamentally dangerous therefore suspicious selfdriving car
thank reading earlier comment india ready yet awesome work
two year ive already pretty confident driverless car much better average human time theyre optimum environment
need johnny cab fake comedian front seat total recall good one arnold
driverless car road better keep social credit score high otherwise allowed travel
men turned thinking machine hope would set free permitted men machine enslave frank herbet
problem lack control ownership
make driverless car electric im
love intelligent people developing intelligent autonomous system driving stupid people dont drive trust plenty
derek learnt feel comfortable sitting next wife driving im sure trust computer
learned feel comfortable sitting next wife driving wife learned feel comfortable sitting next driving cant blame
every video see saying driverless car ready showing proof concept sunny area little congestion show car navigating city heavy rain start convinced going assume one highway downpour start going freak come stop middle road cant see line
exactly driverless car arent ready theyre truly nowhere near actual level capability mean emergency two option stop possible ideally traffic hand control back fleshy meat bag
closest thing right tesla fsd beta lot video youtube
title say ready
plane cant fly bad weather either plane impress either
poochyenarulez would issue pilotless plane cant handle change weather human available take control
wasted car value car decommissioned totaled actually financially burn use parked waste time automotive value equation milestime equation milesmoney cant compare apple apple valuewise amount time car spends parked unless normalize convert among money mile time need make equation sit equal single equality statement milestimemoneymiles xyz
idea car self driving would like taxi number car needed would decrease le accident would happen le car need scrapped replaced
callumwilde would great long way feartechnologically legally logistically economically
possible personally one like rental service
gained amazing amount trust watching thank derek siri youtube kinda made lose hope ai awesome
real moral dilemma taking entire industry used employ million people removing job marketplace number job required sustain newly automated industry always fraction previously employed said industry wealth longer distributed throughout society concentrated tiny number hand thus accrue outsized influence meanwhile resultant unemployed scrabble around trying scratch living fewer fewer competitive oppportunities eventually reach point long since passed individual work two job side hustle working least hour seven day week still barely able afford rent race bottom drive wage outsized power flex muscle squeeze ever favour receptive rapacious poolitical class eagerly enabling time obviously greatly increase tension disaffection level society top empire civilisation fall real moral dilemma sort thing also last halfcentury assiduous incessant almost entirely successful propaganda drive popularise inculcate monomlithic norm glorification virtue conspicuous wealth cultish worship altar mammon thats even fraction real moral dilemma endeth whatever
still problem driverless car interconnected keep talking cyber crime cyber warfare well hey let make everyones immediate safety another part
someone wearing super good light absorbing light reflective material would handled eg vantablack v retroreflective material one would think youd need multiple frequency lidar infrared radar etc account hit method see object overlay data source
leah olivia imagine one u least living city realistically without car even limit job significant increase travel time course give modern technology convenience live simple life one privileged sure
transition long time one thing noticed vehicle new im poorer person cant afford new car thats thought year away
dream day go vacation country different traffic law able use autonomous vehicle get obscure place dream turn nightmare everyone else able thing remote serene location become overrun tourist
know really cool idea driving car india see happens
little fish wan na go future older fish future little fish today
car detects construction site detects well deep hole pit fall bad road
honestly kid dont think kid ever drive car think normal car like horse
recurring nightmare feed devised oh yeah google never mind
lot driverless car road arent personally owned reused transport people sound awful lot like train bus additional step althoughi think autocars train bus fill different niche city going need try adapt best fit present future rural folktrains bus still wont work autocars could helpexcept probably cant shared youre asking rural folk buy expensive device subscribe lessexpensive service since ish american live rural area massive amount people convince city shouldnt held back rural area cant keep may case incentive cost offset required surmount challenge
driving early model selfdriving car doesnt mean ready car developed build u falling face get europe dont road perfect square grid reason tesla autopilot terrible europe unexpected action tech ready yet least year
anyone else watching car
look ok wide american road cant see time soon narrow super congested british road far many variable play imo
delamain origin
beyond cool
traffic
car head heel sight cart
ending funny want able sit automated car order spend time working automated car
sensor go bad enough trust
know tesla full self driving meme
feel like vaporware cant wait actual self driving public transport wonder traffic congestion
thing additional technology display would make car consumer accesible yet thats reason still think year away making possible vehicle autonomous driving service like uber eager swap dont keep paying driver first make megacorps richer without tax regulation take consideration im afraid change economy transition period
interesting video basically advertisement waymo since sponsoring video course glowing thing included video objective assessment technology think leaf desired
totally need time predict pedestrian behavior often use human signal like eye contact body language predict pedestrian cross road
nothing special excited
wont happy driverless car could high speed cannonballesque driving hour take corner speed canyon
great video working company much smaller project waymo pull look sorta hope help making topic accepted people certainly concern personally project leader believe autonomous car first used business private people transportation good first later regular company car fleet company le personal fear vehicle like average driver dont worry missing fun driving
future public transportation car
believe
cool still wont trust though wait decade
hour crew
drinker love car
car drive india without crashing trust tech fully jk
ill never get one
wouldnt wouldnt safe nothing wan na hear car highly regulated many reason make airbags belt ab mandatory law company striving safety trust buzzlines like try sell something look behind marketing veil
elon proud
beginning autonomous vehicle research ive said transition accelerated insurance weighs safe driver discount applied autonomous vehicle heavy premium applied insist driving particularly humanfault accident raising premium crash
something almost never see talked privacy implication driverless society understandable course safety concern first thing come head entertain moment imagine world parking lot take taxi wherever want go create full record trip name address payment information pick drop location google amazon whoever else know every single place ever visit freely give government institution asks without warrant use stalk understand everything sell stuff there really way stop youre someone el car even make illegal cant tell still collected imagine want attend protest police killed member community well cop get exact log every single person dropped near protest know exactly live something okay im willing trade increased safety autonomous vehicle privacy dont want tracked ditch phone go wherever want wont allowed anymore restructure society humandriven car impractical real problem need consider
doesnt system require fully accurately mapped road network work
someone who never driver license interesting many driver talk autonomous car like give amazing benefit experience take bus like still commute traffic even watch movie sleep trust whole life
every single car driven automatically rate accident would nearly
mm phalanx ciws
unexpected side benefit perhaps going see better security car driverless car think facial recognition driver code even silent alarm im sure driverless car become common private property see car thief luck end road
technology impressive especially also work well heavy traffic still trusting would like see reacts unusual situation like partially blocked road cross solid line proceed policeman regulating traffic
situation covered video youtube
would react situation weve like debris road plastic bag floating oncoming traffic recognize safely hit make hard stop swerve every object
dosadoodle ive never seen video demonstrating car understands verbal instruction subtle hand signal given officer directing traffic
would like see computer handle lane splitting motorcycle
playing gta online year saythe npc ai lead believe taking player data collision detection odd moment rel world people driving honestly ai good today self driving car video game driver good predetermined nearly rail expirience diviation coded program struggle
im really curious self driving car interact self driving car signal lidar hundred driverless car high speed way wouldnt create interference
said wifi way deal
autonomous vehicle allowed succeeded force human road let hope fail benefit humanity
comment make absolutely sense written
amazing
ill trust system there enough road way computer able coordinate rather working independently trust technology dont trust everyone else
yet say dont trust everyone else still get road long computer isnt driving thats whole point discussed video already point computer better driver average regardless many computer already driving
bigralphsmithyeah absolutely get course feeling arent logical theyre feeling easy understand person would feel uneasy giving control vehicle everyone else road still control
asheleydavies thats root problem derek talking feeling control even intellectually understand feeling illusion first scary twentieth time even moment hesitation
want autonomous vehicle road adopted quickly possible finally make anxiety le riding bike
ok deal travel kr puram btm layout km hour start one peace weekday
man real want die first black bird fire fly
happens incremental weather snow hail ice even bug could block sensor way remove obstruction sensor
yes
strongly belive technology create something clever vast majority u something evaluate situation much faster woudlnt hesitate even second putting trust driverless vehicule
imagine one car hearing robotic voice say low battery mode activated side sensor turned bug changing logic value true false
yeah even risk still safer counter intuitive isnt
bigralphsmith im sure place state safer yet academic debate around still inconclusive
deny human error main factor traffic crash fatality im aligned scholar movement opposes driverless car distracts city really need le car dependency
thank year critical well researched content
cant come soon enough
show car handle edge case ill impressed need dodge pothole need take detour construction going lane road large truck come way case make difference
clearly ad instead scientist approach technology million mile trained driving make fact car reasoning ability confidently driving idiotic phrase seem confident machine video embarrassing
software engineer work map realtime traffic data ai decision making thesis type feel time safer autonomous vehicle humandriven one
driving complex need much adapting every situation human bad think decent think ai couldnt possibly good enough keep human
wonder future government make humanoperated car illegal except certain area like designated area smoking place
every car road using type lidar would effective
would love subscription ride service hate owning car hate driving people idiot often yell others drive around yeah shouldnt driving
hope paid lot video probably worst video purely sellout video market tech still love wish video research put brought potential selfdriving suite well
walking flight stair would extended life
car stop siren burglar umhh dont lift car
""
bet flying car future get self driving car guess could get wanted huh
testing one though aslo fly
happens one car lidar see another car lidar something differentiates car lidar
derek dont get distracted selfdriving car get hacked one
""
still would trust selfdriving car hack car doesnt mean hack another
thesavantart havent seen mr robot
commercial airflight pilot trained far computer interface rather mechanic instrument hand time caused problem pilot lack lot basic skill would needed couple decade back trouble figuring thing majority pilot could diagnosed absolute major problem autonomous car property right prefer thing rent want car still rent software work dont want subscription service vehicle want zero telemetry everything especially electric autonomous car built kill switch demonstrated susceptible wireless hacking device made remotely mess sensor ill forgo car set specifically liking requirement ill use car one belongs someone personally know im hauling large amount stuff hardware store collecting something size fridge id letting anyone dont know damn well using vehicle either regardless making money sitting idle
shall named riding car
sponsored waymo hmmm wonder bad thing hell say lmao
need get rid thing human driver traffic sign
need get rid thing car need thing public transport bicycle
useri im ok car car driver way dangerous fact year car driver kill people terrorist organization combined
europe
weird getting car driver trusting car hah im worried trusting people tech tech see happened lime scooter see happened another revolutionary technology g going last long need work building people cope technology force people face oh hey there one let trash part government control zuck tech let trash spawn satan let trash im cynical im realistic
autonomous car great human driving road imagine itll autonomous car driving communicating car would receive information car around would able see kilometer away also know condition road traffic everywhere
channel getting worse worse time stop reviewing product like godly pay get opinion like get sponsor product dont review video completelly biased
idiot decide use test accident scenario could easily done civic car isnt rare skyrocketing price driverless car somehow failed act correctly damage much costly difficult replace really reason take risk
butit doesnt come manual trannyhard pas
problem waymo think lack adaptability remember correctly vehicle geofences require accurate lidar scan area drive driver like idea autonomous car especially last mile public transport opinion individual person ride reduced replaced autonomous bus dont use pre made route pick schedule autonomous car pick adaptive human driver road one main concern privacy every vehicle know status whole system even safer efficient routing still dont allow passenger tracking behavioral analysis
question even top th percentile good driver get accident occasionally whether fault deal liability automatic car get accident
india yep thats self driving car project test train model india become reliable country
want excel dash train marathon
someone hack car software
feel like delamain mission cyberpunk
im surprised didnt mention tesla personally enjoy driving dont think would like every car autonomous maybe option able drive want
scared watching
want motorized traffic around globe electrical selfdriving car period dont even explain animation dating year back right showing exactly car know exactly everything else flow smoother carefully choreographed car show speed would go youd get destination faster safer distracted please
someone experience field confirm multiple company already much better human autopilot good driving condition main problem ive seen field older car company understanding develop software general newer company overestimate result nnbased solution get case end autopilot would occasionally catastrophically fail waymo know develop software hardware use complete overkill expensive least guarantee minimum level safety lot come using ridiculously expensive also reliable lidar tesla solution entirely based nns processing camera image doesnt give baseline safety see accident autopilot often fails trivial situation due limitation nns whole concept based human brain theyve skipped step human brain us simple hardwired algorithm generate data two camera fully autonomous car made entirely using camera without simpler predictable perception algorithm compared tesla dont necessarily need lidar though cheaper lidar would warmly welcomed keep mind solution would lead car road autonomous would mean autopilot shouldnt add much cost total cost vehicle would say good approximation limit lidar nn heavy solution get even close limit tldr imo technology easily cheaply limited human error people managing project
problem autonomous car lot modern car matter theyre connected send data time there many manufacturer everything pretty much centralized way something government interested especially name fight climate change whatever current issue might necessarily bad thing definitelly something need recognize take account past point return
believe l autonomous driving self driving car drive around boston year round phoenix mostly dry sunny wide obvious road boston full twisty narrow road unusualoneoff traffic situation way way intersection intersection go n n lane intersection marking ton construction car destroying pot hole snow aggressive driver lot chaos cant imagine waymos current lidar working sprayed salty slush may reach l full self driving certain condition full self driving condition way way today fsd play chess drive boston similar challenging environment need play improvisational jazz
video making dream opened eye give u sincere opinion considering sponsored video suppose far away video im curious
feel car common number sensor decreased like overkill beginning ensure safety efficient dont expect first product
ice road
timestamp driver car right texting
simple solution traffic imagine accurate perfect precision man time alive edit dont kick
handle dust dirt person owns driverless car doesnt clean happens
super cumbersome noisy compare tesla
wait minute million people dy car accident year arent vaxxinated like today c v
wud use autonomous car autonomous car road human driving alongside selfdriving car there room accident remove human element driving completely id board
green space yeah right like free real estate
still green space green expect hahaha
good know stop autonomus siren
better average human average case probably road ever changing obstacle course live didnt really try difficult situation
waymo testing every day make progress
india
ive waiting since first saw autonomous car test race surprise taken long really holding back regulation think government focused allowing way convert old car autonomous wed using autonomous car within year
looking forward inevitable robot apocalypse
one advantage propagation driverless vehicle didnt mention plummeting insurance premium fewer accident fewer claim lower insurance cost im curious one waymo vehicle cost technology onboard im betting quite expensive tesla owner look forward true driverless experience one fine day
instead make city le carcentric
waiting train
modern helpful technology right developed country country take year
say religious blind non scientific politician hate developed west
love multifuncional transparent screen protects computer getting covid passenger getting debris car crash p
theyve never bangladesh good luck automated vehicle xd
bangladeshi guy hate western developed country much asking though related comment
people love speed long take people patient enough travel within law
drunk driving car car driving drunk progress
think get around actually bringing selfdriving car general public mass production le le accident car easily talk immediately know another car would swerve turn thus able easily avoid collision
slow acceptance self driving car connected network
yes every car developed road automated connected would accident cause computer mistake
idk much lidar would second one vehicle road interfere others laser
dont anymore get excited technology end isnt improvement humanity improvement technology
hope place human driver road future kinda like driving
think greater good forced rent car big corporation major communication allow driver car
ballet car cgpgrey video going happen requires car working connected system trust participant even worse managed master system somewhere work way giant security risk one bad actor cause terrible damage improportionately higher compared current model every road user treated distrust
self driving vehicle system equipped function communication bonus vehicle would still aware would talking shared network
veritateseducational talking doesnt speed thing im significant fashion cant unconditionally trust communication
trucker majority pedestrian car terrible driver almost seems like intentionally almost trucker ive talked belief driverless carstrucks lifetime im trying get asap dont want stuck career doesnt exist anymore useful skill year
whats autonomous car going absurdly cold weather road covered multiple layer snow ice
technology economy dont human didnt live arizona
two question fully electric buy personal use
he got dream response music going trusted
due upper body mobility dysfunction parked car sold longer safe behind wheel autonomous vehicle something waiting
aye mean panic attack trying start car get rolling along muscle problem leg give lead foot live part rural nsw australia kmmi next town kmmi drive nearest city car kinda required need go grocer road expect carry anything light breakfast lunch making shopping bag
live phx arizona im going see try
johnny cab better question used poll viewer ridiculous nice infomercial though
sponsored content advertisement technology working dont believe take vacation phoenix arizona
veritateseducational many assumption upset dont seem thinking clearly also seem superimposing thing may wished id said actually maybe deep breath get back youve settled stay safe
spaceyoutube im sorry think problem said video infomercial wasnt wrongfully assumed think system isnt ready fault
veritateseducational apparently comment link posted suggesting watch tom nicholas video titled veritasium story youtube propaganda discus video deleted let see one go
watching video wondered happend someone grabbed steering wheel tried block car turning stop go people would able block wheel even would affect car
would still turn car wheel connected thats wheel say dont touch would mess entire system probably cause accident
take many many year applicable eastern europe driver line non existant along safe driving culture
really awesome video
want reality would save many life think reasonable skeptic like hacker solarflares kid throwing egg sensor hehe also saying build infrastructure necessary everywhere make work could take decade
hacker shouldnt much issue modern encryption car arent driving network network monitor system waymo hq solar flare would affect anything egg thing would real issue need cleaned kid taught lesson also infrastructure required make work factory yes driving self contained
nothing tesla vision im dissapointed feel like waymo add
tesla fsd isnt ready still worked waymo level tesla level
veritateseducational waymo ready know sometimes stop working agent come resolve issue driving right
andreigrigoruta doesnt stop reason rarely make emergency stop due issue detected system
depends danger level go exponentially get major uptown area trust car car tech dont trust people outside car
resident chandler az get used even though still make weird choice arent particulary dangerous decision
love idea driverless car hate side could drive autonomous car work beaten straight piped corrola much fun
tried auto car india secondes later car got blue screen death
beautifully made
would car road suddenly blocked falling tree also pas double line lane go side road actually forbidden youre blocking way
would see tree stop im reading said right think car would see line go
nice looking k concept car
designed run cab service purchase
would prefer autonomous driving find way deal indian road
dont get distracted driver yes sure never seen computer program failed task never seen bug security flaw scam countless new avenue manipulate car licence scam manipulating brake dont pay ransome breaking car beeing unable repair faking streetsigns follow obediently happens rain heavy snowfall vision blurred expensive lidar system get edge get trapped anywhere unlucky happens construction worker lane remarked lane different color one right one correct lane based context traffic light problem get coverd eailsily city want traffic light tell car turn green technology make make every light expensive fck
better scanner give time
one day big cme hit earth fun
yes driverless car great offer solution lot problem think better easily fixed mean like better public transport redesign american city compared netherlands home country u way dangerous road different problem example driver way worse trained road dangerously designed bu giving everybody lot room speed big road function small street constantly traffic coming road mentioned video cgp grey self driving car city yes solution problem solution would like adam something released reaction video cgps video day ago giving great reason isnt something want city also want watch video city planning better solution car problem recommend bike guy born canada practically everywhere life amsterdam great urban planning good option transport without needing car car option necessary love video one good well dont think driverless car solution stuck traffic great people disability public transport done right course everybody
want make interesting video om public transport netherlands chance promise n dutch railway interesting complex planning infrastructure daily around train rout planned million passenger small country netherlands must really complex lot failsafe option etc
might good future actually dangerous like example hacker might take advantage kidnapper might also hack bring victim hideout car thief might take advantage also terrorist might know terrorist stuff
please explain would hack car isnt wireless isnt communicating anything make drive communicating waymo hq tell
veritateseducational us computer drive vehicle operate manage thing also car wireless stuff going like ai guess even cctv camera hackable baby monitor social medium account although computer might secondary operate car still hackable
mrvincec car doesnt drive wirelessly way hack unless got car started rip open computer could change code
hijacking car braking software stealing code tracker also hacked tricking human assistant hq car going right route managing communication passenger done without wire connected basically like phone work somehow wireless maybe satellite whatever point fact tesla also hackable cant
mrvincec well point wouldnt able make car drive autonomously anywhere want high jacking idea could slim possibility though
plot twist someone actually driving car remote control
waymos technology laughably behind tesla need geofencing lidar tesla camera anywhere baby safety fence video would much better could present company working self driving since sponsored pretty much ad waymo
tesla fsd ready working waymo including multiple system like tesla lidar main camera secondary work together currently tesla level waymo level
veritateseducational well kinda tesla far ahead technology doesnt need lidar anymore might level everywhere waymo rely geofence lidar tesla activate fsd flick switch game could buy tesla tomorrow drive probably sometime within next couple year thats case theyll fleet robotaxis printing money sleep pretty much anywhere world waymo need map every single place world good luck considering world isnt fully mapped google map yet probably never granted dont need map entire world still going take tesla le time reach level waymo map entire u point would anyone hire ugly waymo hire classy tesla play game best infotainment system
go ab starting people think bad loving
car enthusiast hobby
autonomous vehicle doesnt mean car london underground victoria line since late
thing average driver statistic single objective measure good driving everyone different standard condition actually majority average
didnt know driverless elevator problem took granted elevator drive push button didnt give second tought im guessing child child take driverless car granted like many people elevator
yes self driving car probably cause le accident thats great think pretty utilitaristic point view take account self driving car pretty much first technology act autonomous robot interacting human morally juristically relevant level even though alle moral dilemma scenario improbable still important discus define core principle car behaviour
vehicle waymo experience
think upcoming year manually operated vehicle going replaced fully automatic vehicle thats great
midwest rough driving condition lot road line faded pothole common curious see handle another big issue weather condition drive clear day v icy road different even without risk human error need stop sooner sometimes slow increase speed visibility poor even higher risk someone around hitting big issue think would need solved arent already consider ready fully adopted however issue stated could probably fixed software interested see go
get weird vibe got sponsored waymo video talk whole lot problem waymo yet face example jjricks studiosexperience youtube construction zone car blocked traffic considerable amount time got impression waymos fleet dependent street layout mapped specifically service change layout construction cause problem maybe im wrong wouldve nice hear fix problem sound like cant possibly scale service need specific mapping construction data every little city waymo would operate
construction zone issue moment thing developing
youre highway kid suddenly go bafroom there rest stop immediately ahead driver could make splitsecond decision quickly could alter waymo route friend two want listen new beck album cruising around aimlessly maybe youll hit drivethrough maybe origindestination route fine waymo others deal spontaneity dont want corporation historical record every inch youve ever travelled
assume would function similarly apple map divert system would probably select option map seat ask rest stop fast food isnt currently thing see future
metric shouldnt autonomous vehicle get accident create error need much multiple better human driver answer already take time car autonomous sure allow road better le human error get work minute v hour reduction stupid wreck rubbernecking
im strong supporter driverless autonomous car felt example given elevator airplane bit weak elevator like train predefined track car hand almost limitless path go advantage plane sky decently vast hardly near enough another plane except airport stuff flying airport load sensor thing help plane land think missing today life autonomous vehicle built drive existing road without road enhancement change dont think mean autonomous car doomed feel delay overall speed getting need car fit system like trying fit something closed loop open loop system
handle swoop squat
many job eliminate ha shure driver prepared studiying programming ten programmer like driver job market handle technology advance faster social lightyears opinion automatically eliminates delivery work last resort employing
whatever say there lot positive point negetive one
happygood
even level tesla model amazing driving minimal input autopilot full self driving software dont agree tesla thinking camera work fine system time heavy rain car couldnt activate autopilot feature poor visibility im excited driverless road
ad getting ridiculous min long smh
ha ha ha funny
question hal personally write scritpt
would rather robot drive people driverless car low deathrate every car autonomous long human error road deathrate high know plenty retard low iq driving barely make right decisons aspect life think make right one road hundred variable given moment human arnt made process info going mph human reaction time slow
want die like grandfather peacefully sleep screaming like passenger bus drove cliff
would illegal europe
think terrified time excited cant wait stop driving hate driving would love tech
could like dunno maybe build light rail system instead
anti rail sentiment ignorant american perpetuated oil company well never fast trail good train system pretty sad actually
public cost involved make happen america incomparable privately owned developed autonomous vehicle really autonomous vehicle might help making public transport acceptable america reclaiming land parking lot make american city dense enough walkable
police get vehicle pull arrest suspect onboard
mentioned vehicle pull siren based loud assume kept siren driver would eventually forced cancel
happens stearing program start buffering computer home run flawlessly never crash buffer ill trust driverless car saw distinct lack skepticism video person answered question spokesperson company data reviewed company data always biased
answer motorcycle dilemma similar one human answer usually freak instead making rational decision bet put human driver situation least would kill bikers fact human driver havent figured every accident situation either messy ethic situation arent manual test there right wrong answer people situation fact autonomous vehicle even make decision proof theyre better driver people instead focusing million life saved every year people focusing misguided idea computer would choose die human would kill incompetence also idea driving without helmet safer autonomous vehicle choose hit driver helmet situation bad statistic bikers likely get accident something road inattentiveasshole human driver reckless driving situation autonomous car choose two bikers hit exactly one wearing helmet nearly every motorcyclerelated incident could ever happen helmet wearer le danger nonhelmet wearer regardless autonomous vehicle choose fringe situation like never make driving without helmet safer option
even expert say hope year big city think u right
concern really internal autonomy software dystopian sceptic coming dont lot public surveillance germany would worried communication server distribution video audio data remote handling car safety car driving car would able drive safely without communication internet sim card would get one without second thought
think video tesla would much useful entertained use fancy technologie
thing company use lidar radar camera scanned map build trust pave way truly autonomous vehicle yes trust company doesnt use lidar radar map pure camera vision claim able make fully autonomous car end year process company cause many accident reason people shy away autonomous driving word tesla biggest obstacle autonomous vehicle atm
cgpgrey made excellent video inevitable future automation year ago included great segment autonomous vehicle
one thing disagree autonomous car solve traffic need mass transit improvement road capacity making car autonomous much smaller improvement creating good public transport system
comparing mile driven ai mile driven human utterly meaningless many mile take get human reasonable safe driving level effective would ai given number mile belt yeah difference quality learning pretty significant trying say ai car bad idea supposed science channel youre making really crappy argument
car wouldve introduce better first autonomous car without ac heat yikes true autonomous history ever assumed even air issue autonomously polluting traffic sensor get dangerous mechines rendering like u thats new distraction influince paddern
think biggest thing keeping selfdriving car taking people driving autonomous car work flawlessly car road would autonomous itd take one person breaking road rule driving erratically autonomous car get crash either autonomous car normal car dont think realistically inbetween unless made lane autonomous car go etc
get hacked

focus increasing improving automating public transit oh wait soulless tech company investing driverless car increase profit america wake invest rail public transit need le car road walkablebikeable city
good lidar camera detecting people cyclist good car predicting motion concern
really good
ai cant drive car edge like race driver tho therefore human better driving ai
human better self driving car overall self driving car much better average human
thank derek ive failing trying explain people autonomous car reduce x accident x percent thats better anything human weve accepted accident normal thing weve spent probably billion making car safe accident know bound happen took half shitty driver put autonomous car autonomous car le accident thats fewer accident without thats net positive thats need net positive mean life saved le injury safer road
driverless car confidence inspiring safety reason limited kmh even would make bonejarring sudden stop comfortable fun something id like experience technology fault limit put upon
mean waymo could reduced driving data set million mile getting driving data conducting experiment indian road survive indian road survive anything
talking dunningkruger effect also known cognitive bias make video topic already
different thing
big difference two
davidwuhrer almost one prime example dunning kruger effect driver confidence thing course stupid people thinking smart
shameena two different concept commuted false analog fallacy cough dunning kruger effect cough
shameena also known almost red also known loud whenever see someone talking dunningkruger effect someone paper
safest way get around robust public transit system designing city walkability mind car way le safe train subway bike walking
feel like year would completely replace human
feel like would work better everyone autonomous vehicle could use sort network car could communicate thus would car crashing
doesnt tesla technology looking good costing k model
tesla using visioncameras different much lower cost set sensor hard problem crack may pay dividend end
saw question community tab well think autonomous vehicle safe average human unsafe
man car must much anxiety imagining possible scenario
yeah like blue screen error death maybe itd go core overheat shutting
trust technology dont trust people though
transportation cost go know true human greed ensure autonomous vehicle monopoly cost rise higher owning vehicle would like see video vehicle enduring series realworld obstacle closed course seeing correctly handling worst situation may inspire confidence technology
rather see handle real world obstacle real world
literally every aspect history technology show untrue regular car refrigerator computer much started reach got cheaper time imply autonomous car would different nonsense
autonomous car obstacle course search darpa challenge roborace
dude great way commute without driving car public transport oh wait north america
biggest problem driverless car people like drive car feel control give freedom adrenaline lot time go drive addicted driving well never able get rid human driver road completely focused implementing technology make driving safer rather removing driver altogether
absolutely right
really liked stats interview great eye opening video
get type people responding comment ill trouble soon please stop
question wasnt human continue dehumanize hand soul away prof desire perfection drive u split humanity remain become cyborg comparing elevator losing operator driver car one dumbest thing ive heard say also mention pilot error completely ignore max debacle call trying play god recreate human brain
im le concerned get car autonomous im concerned transition period significant number people still driving people terrible driver computer account stupidity thats way difficult flying plane without surrounded crazy
example terribleness comean autonomous car avoid accident whenever possible fact plus people impatient inconsiderate jerk mean there going decent number people intentionally cutting front autonomous car knowing full well yield avoid accident
think wouldve easier cheaper create better public transport like train tram etc shown multiple time reduce accident death road street driverless car one car street doesnt help pollution waste material
average consumer confused purchase tesla thinking driverless self driving car tesla nowhere near level driverless car seen video manmade item using hardware software occasionally glitch result accident current model tesla thats purchased car salesman constantly repeating self driving car hand wheel aware surroundings live san francisco see fully autonomous driving car every day sometimes even multiple going one street im comfortable around dont even think im driving past pulling front danger whatsoever reckless driver human im afraid
please remove monkey behind wheel cant describe much want

clear solution traffic always reduce number car traffic wrt traffic value autonomous vehicle reducing traffic rather giving driver back time spend captive driver seat needing focus utterly monotonous tedious yet incredibly dangerous task true value driverless car however public safety mentioned video nonetheless solution need focused improved mass transit system like train better bus route dedicated bus lane subsidized price etc anything encourage people forgo car many fewer car road also directly result reduced emission reduced need parking three bird price one driverless vehicle dont really solve whole car spend time parked problem since majority driving happens largely time direction maybe figure could get like able move parking away since driver wont need car close enough walk still valuable
blatant onesided advertisement seems like video talking head need scrutinizing
wish would talk expense sensor see sell right cost modern car sensor expensive car sensor plus car
well good driving trough american suburb let car drive trough european city pedestrian cyclist everywhere also im car death rate compared usa besides driving challenging bar archive better human also lot higher also idk think car giant lump metal designed hold people luggage driven person without luggage stupid hell well self driving car dont help might even reduce average rider ship car would even worse currently around like cab stupidly inefficient without driver easiest solution traffic reduce size vehicle also make sustainably lower maintenance cost infrastructure lower overall noise generated per person ofc driverless car better car human single lane tram transport much people tram every mintues lane road packed car also train longer router tram cite

mixed feeling fully autonomous car us like urban highway driving think tech close already issue safety related would car react street hockey game kid dont move cause think funny stop car steering wheel limit use car preprogrammed driving task require human interaction driving dirt road inspecting fence line parking unmarked lot need work best way transition fully autonomous autonomy brake even full automation highway would significantly reduce fatality road since injury increase speed
maniac thing people good driving
try vehicle swindon magic roundabout navigate way around buy one
love idea everything time also scare work together save million life whats stopping someone sending car shady location crashing car remotely whats stopping togetherness system ruin life thing elevator step fully automated car would see protection place
exciting prospect moving away model car ownership car subscription service imagine world citysuburb street arent cluttered parked car nothing every day instead fleet car would constantly driving around making trip people optimising route process freeing valuable land open space
sue accident car wont go jail seems weird imprison programmer financial compensation company seems inadequate especially deadly accident also would personally easier time forgive human error program reason decided weird reflection obviously le people die still great would like see problem addressed since obviously still gon na traffic fatality
nice ad shortcoming though
would love become widely available legal operate without driver license visual disability mean never get license self driving car would allow kind access freedom movement fully sighted person

true
people needed driver elevator couldnt believe could automated year back people needed driver car couldnt believe could automated dont see similarity current technological breakthrough might seem ridiculous paradigm shift occurs everything seem normal future kid would mocking u practising manual driving car p
like idea driverless car arent helping mobility turnaround driverless car service number people car reduces instead increasing road still full car electric use green energy cant use green energy somewhere else need expand public transport
started hating driving realized idiotic driver im thrilled autonomous car ubiquitous remove bad driver good compromise

people think average driver saying there chance im right p
mean average dont even need exist data set unlikely though people could incredibly skilled driver could beyond utter trash driving giving u average middle represents actual driver thats power outlier extreme
average driver america horrific average yearly mile driven k ive cleared k every year year safely say top tier driver average person tailgate
assuming average driver believe average seems unlikely saying chance best

wait till people start hijacking car without even getting near
see wrong poll thanks making video derek feel like jumped year future learning actually im bit caught reality

think difficult part transition would getting people let go driving many people would voluntarily give car take ride service personally like freedom able decide go whim instant access vehicle sure car autonomous huge safety improvement board difference car elevator user werent driver
problem always car never able drive foreseeing smoothly cant reliably watch car ahead movement infer driver next human intuition tell driver think probably react whats front talking much safety extreme situation car better everyday traffic able drive much smoothly save fuel brake see ahead better either come gas brake think technology actually make car safer worth everyday traffic majority car communicating traffic light bus ambulance tram etc course cant done night like ev self driving car sold communication working effectively
driverless car need great training sent country india great place car learn many thing

mean sure vehicle mph crash probably bad looking extreme stop totally see someone would crash car trying pas behind following
im good thanks lot go ahead like driving car
pro save money save life con loses million job
sound like pro job focused world literally one largest cause world problem life shouldnt depend job
pro freeing million manhours spent driving
sheridantank thats great people put food table
thats world spin hence fact used elevatordrivers great example stick past job
pro creating million job design build run system operation
trust driverless car driveroperated car
dont think people said itd take year wrong selfdriving car still lot trial test need able complete become commonplace road test could easily take year thorough
im worried people taking advantage driverless car driver knowing cut front car stop there nothing really cant help feel people keep driver car jerk driver get work couple minute faster
buzzing sound car spinning sensor ac unit sound really annoying
saying someone legally blind make sound like arent blind slightest
car used lidar wont signal interfere
india youll still find elevator driver
look great let wait yr get latin america
con la calidad de la carreteras que tenemos tal vez aos
thing autonomous vehicle need perfect need better human
self driving car dont get drunk fatigued stressed distracted way quicker reflex imo way safer human driver frankly think morally wrong use could saving life
could get siren make everyones car pull side
could rn anyway
yeah would also crime even today
car still see actual ambulance otherwise would know coming avoid path even blocking way
wollfy dont think use ambulance classifier track sound coming drive side road
car doesnt hit stationary object showing one slam full speed overturned semi
tesla lidar lol
tesla driver paying attention brake engage white truck side recognised system
google master thing like
best advertisementsupport automatic car self driving car drive india problem driving america europe mean nothing term difficulty autonomous vehicle work asia controlled situation lot people loosing job felt like stuff seen year indian need proof india seen road empty video lockdown india car react slow chaotic traffic boring video basic good enough channel experimented compromising situation make sponsor pay legal issue accident still rickshaw random manually pulled cart road
autonomous car case police chase car stop considered betrayal owner case going police like pro ie car help violate law
waymo car perform midwest winter
first dislike veritasium video yay
comment get lost anyways whoever read good time
thought kdrama startup randomly
dont need pilot land airplane get paid hundred thousand dollar wtf
million go go diamond play button
absolutely ready driverless car dont trust driver im road thought would switch driveless car communicate would safer
fear isnt based selfdriving car would perform difficult situation doubt selfdriving car would better majority time emergency situation worry would always selfdriving car deciding something bizarre seemingly reason situation appears perfectly safe normal human driver know situation potentially dangerous situation relatively safe human something really stupid case understand selfdriving car feel like even though safer overall point there always chance may choose something inexplicable know thats rational fear often isnt rational
suburb city plain eternal summer challenge car navigate pothole terrible signalling capricious weather impromptu road work festival suicidal cyclist pedestrian montral impressed
thumbnail pretty subpar compared make
please stop saying atonimous
agree lot yes tech year away already major issue really fact road dont car driving biggest risk tech work safely properly orderly would due mass amount human error ik lot people say good driver dumb thing like influence sitting phone looking song texting even people actively break checked car swerving car road people dont properly even use turning signal
make simple car self driving would accident cause communicate since human nah
good luck get somewhere isnt mapped xd
car learning sharing knowledge collectively reminded naruto using clone learn faster
car drive work faster cuz le trafficits also better environmentsign
urban dweller cant produce food water shelter heating clothes etc basic living technology exposure dependence self driving vehicle connected internet network making easy hack remote control without consent digital currency make possible track pay pay digital currency make easy block access buying certain thing like food dont act way people control digital payment network tell act centralization centrally controlling activity technology erode freedom privacy let never allow possibility remotely take control vehicle reject
dont care sell software developer know fine tuned software still getting one automation work strictly controlled environment environment bypass essentially constantempty like sky space trusting software compensate people stupidity road condition etc
yeah car million time experience person driven one year car also need lot experience human learn lesson
place road arent properly maintained got ta call u like derek
dont need lidar geofenced driverless real level
according
thespartan
sjege society automotive engineer standard used nhtsa classifies waymo lvl
true fear monitoring sure tech ready id trust drive around dont trust mics picking noise need also one want touching security concern sponsored video another reason skeptical whole autonomous driver scene yes much safer theoretically could live world without traffic light without traffic many many le death road whole hive mind idea behind hour practice also pretty cool experience live day day traffic car learn drove learn thats truly impressive tech
wow like bus
thats india btw
surely autonomous vehicle better perform also able communicate sharing sensor data
landlocked tiny place theyre phoenix roundabout snow much wildlife infrastructure good heck people go wrong way house punch postcode satnav flawed cant fix driverless car drive actual distance country year
year later cruise ev windscreen smashed dont run fire hose
driveless car already super small premapped area remote supervision
cant wait buying last car hope last one ever buy
given lidar us laser scaling car going represent health hazard people eye cheap laser come warning instruction point eye directly imagine walking near fleet car traffic jam laser scanning like crazy imagine walking along setup year right know lidar make pointcloud image resolution enough represent one head multiple dot perhaps mean hitting one eye simple work way around especially beginning year ppl curious sensor looking frequently dont wan na start rumor though logically assume follow think might issue dont forget made tech ppl hazard may mitigated thats exactly domain think every day selfdriving smashingly hard problem softwaredevelopment perspective solve good level logically effort
human error kill people crappy urban design design road city human bike public transit safety mind become much safer drive pleasant live look traffic death liveability city netherlands v u
safety issue ever discussed privacy freedom choice etc
google sponsored last video platform youtube waymo sponsored one
remember could tell someone drunk driving theyre phone driverless car cant come soon enough
please implement driverless car asap society actually need
ideal would networked autonomous vehicle communicate better detect danger road since may dozen perspective available sharing sensor data car could also fixed sensor point particularly dangerous area road like junction blind turn send information autonomous vehicle approach
imagine terroristic organisation take control server control autonomous driving fascistic government take control put law place force company conroled regieme loyal person someone fit narrative could taken press button really put everything place easy take
robot dont need perfect need better dumb ass
im anti self driving vehicle though wait ransomware hit self driving vehicle however im pro choice freedom make mistake machine infinitely better everything done question point exist thing
u know would amazing autonomous tram line cheap easy safe efficient
thanks great video sir
im russian russia drive bumpy russian road full pothole go around wiggle destroy car suspension cant without experienced driver driverless car evade significant road imperfection postpone vehicle inspection
living eu would love technology public transport city quite walkable public transport quite good would awesome seeing autonomous bus tram populating road probs actual car passing city
technology would amazing van long trip could rest back drive
add shitter im nothing like pinching loaf driving highway
car company gon na like people want change life starting driving job automated vehicle dont need perfect need better human
real problem driverless car trafic avoid unusual situation road human created unusual situation road every car autonomous everything predictable system
wan na see remix climate video update correct time
word risking life going self driving car
whats wrong actual people driving car instead employing array costly technological hardware
driverless geofenced area highres map need updated constantly something even slightly usual happens die joke tesla doesnt even need sponsored video b people make video fsd lol cant achieve full autonomy like waymos approach fundamentally flawed tesla already autonomy yet people fail see shortsightedness comma ai openpilot gon na finish second albeit majorly behind even company like mobileye better chance waymo
fsd isnt even lvl
thespartan lol wtf tesla close level think youre mistaking fsd autopilot watch fsd beta tester video yt also waymo one isnt even level cant even get left turn right also anything little mapped world change waymo wouldnt know navigate actual point actually safe plus cant train extremely unlikely event using simulation tesla infinitely data others combined
ron even beta tester say ready fails unprotected left time often fails perceive object tesla self admittedly lvl according society automotive engineer waymo classified lvl
tech work forseeable future work arid climate one little snow flurry road line obscured
analysis much traffic kid non driver constrained ride parent availability lot way relate risk parent could see vehicle road lot request kid visit friend go store etc elderly would loved available grandmother see dont define success look like find different future somehow use number death efficiency traffic reason move direction amount traffic increase also result tech end better route use traffic data lower percentage accident trip take time number accident baffle choose augment driving car instead reinventing logistics people stuff autonomous driving system work well rail air struggle bad illdefined road think somehow computer horse led carriage autonomous driving would even difficult car lasted long solution add congestedunsustainable system currently also add problem didnt answer helmet v non helmet rider scenario would play dismissed unlikely situation addressed dont yield emergency vehicle also vip vehicle whose owner bought platinum pas subject new law way population would respond imagine emission goal could met reducing fuel consumption single person particular route impossible unreasonable condition car going comply regardless also stated video ready world driver autonomous person also happens lot lidar many vehicle adversarial device purposely mess system people use radar detector install device cause autonomous vehicle let pas cut psychology driver know system avoid accident cost become aggressive leading increase person person accident miscalculate whether vehicle autonomous many question amazing tech think moving people thing way terrible adding mix isnt going result positive future imagine characterize statistic thanks video
know would also achieve goal also significantly cutting transportation cost proper public transit saying
people watch bike channel
useri yes
make transportation autonomous make even safe agree
make public transport proper
u good luck
know already
disappointing two huge lie omission waymo system geofenced easiest drive place extremely expensive added cost make car autonomous double triple cost actual car waymo road forward reducing cost affordable level except used replace paid driver comparing plane also misleading plane operate vast empty space huge distance plane dont dodge pedestrian pothole
im amazed people still think better driver car watching video actually enjoy driving time would gladly give wheel extra safty provides many reason excited dont usually talk dangerous driving really hasnt anything could soon considered reckless foolish drive dont car clearly ready take place dominant ride service provider much
im bit skeptical video sponsored reality messy computer vision nearly reliable human vision yet like believe automated car handle common situation better there something unusual need human intuition theyre hopeless
hey derek cool video wait day car road fully autonomous could another video waymo full fleet active live experiment show traffic jam autonomous car showing counter act prevent traffic jam wave rippling traffic
drive india know whether ready
nope
dont want like autonomous vehicle theyre taking job making thing safer love driving sake driving feeling behind wheel control command something cherish whenever get car dont want lose
whole system change every car evey traffic system autonomous car feel
forever grateful dr igudia youtube cured herpes herbal medication real trusted
love idea hate driving lol id rather go random drive nothing thing dont time im driving road trip visit family mean get time thing
plane argument worthless support datathere case turn automatic system land turn dont generalise topic without proof claim
amazing video also would like see technology used bus better way solve mobility big city car
way work typical european city try amsterdam granada
best part good place beautiful answer dilemma pragmatic
taxi uber driver wont happy
knowing u human automated vehicle get better
well cab driver unhappy
defining ready loose ethically difficult say theyll ready simple fact many variable say trust fully autonomous vehicle time truly way guarantee safety universal system every car monitored simultaneously cant predict human behavior erratic often illegal many case untrained data yet seen driverless car side truck recognized bridge frequency tail light night driving fully expect driverless car safer overall human driver time go point however would trust one
interested video really believe autonomous car sharing future cant come soon enough downside people would start drinking also lety beautiful smart keep good work
see adoption technology slow place world really bad road chaotic traffic also really hard time maintaining road poverty good luck training car many local quirk
wouldnt supply issue driver getting sick pinged nh app england p
much propaganda faulty logic try balancing real challenge facing car
cant trust company leading woman cant even put face mask straight
experienced min trip driverless car another company dense rain got accident hopefully employee take control vehicle stopped becomes serious hit obstacle dont know video honest sponsored company realized really nice weather dont feel technology ready however experience still impressive feel important progress
wonder driverless car would respond lidar detects car approaching behind high speed driverless car stopped red light hit behind driving multiple time due idiot crashing stopped
entire video ignore problematic real traffic many accident happen weird configuration specific rule weird junction uncommon roundabout cobblestone road bicycle motorcykles pedestrian animal mention rule breaking fuckup illegal overtaking jaywalking anything unpredicted know shown dont moment believe ready london manhattan amsterdam sure hell wont work big city india get america grid like system long straight road tarmac europe isnt ready proof concept impressive arent much aeroplane seeming like complicated technology close interaction moving body sentient thing isnt great run legal action define right call ai case accident avoid hitting people cost detriment passenger favor passenger take responsibility case accident ai doesnt matter ai drive better cant resolved itll continuously problem self driving car exist traffic cost vehicle like failure camera unit left hand v right hand drive road interchanging one way difference road marker different country law change boarder change im big advocate selfdriving vehicle saying ready overstatement year sound right thing ironed mass distribution common man technology overconfidence technology presented video fails grasp complexity fully self driving mass produced car would require isnt human better driver technology need hit many mark accommodate current society infrastructure even cost requirement
live finland winter lot snow make really difficult lidar camera see road also snow easily glogs camera snow autonomous car ready good road development possible car drive hard condition
ready dorsey zuckerberg bezos musk cook etc decide youre allowed drive
dunno considering youtube also owned alphabet let post kinda seems like theyll let want doesnt
shammyh dont say thing dont like there lot thing theyll ban content creator instantly like name certain whistleblower youre allowed innocuous conversation doesnt mean theyll let say anything thats legal
shammyh also ton normal comment autodeleted youtube include nameswords like ww era german leader regardless context meaning even historical fact blocked dont see doesnt mean doesnt exist problem
great topic protect accident driver others pretty interested year
who filming car lol
dont fooled point though thinking company developing technology save life thats good marketing
please tesla test drive
reminds chucky
sorry car driven human car reliability pretty high ok incident caused human error stats meaningless
almost accident due human error human stupidity bad stupid one also one safer technology
oh look exactly like map created xiaomi vacuum well almost xd
sure comfort autonomous car much time take overtake human arizona surely beautiful
would interferance lidar two distincts automated vehicules
basically yes also read article time ago claimed possible confuse lidarbased driverless car laser pointer
overheard old lady supermarket say wouldnt order domino pizza didnt trust driverless car get food safely
vehicle waymo experience human driver
get vehicle better choice worry driver drunk driver drugged driver stunting driver distracted driver worry system react video though make convincing argument future really
id interested see car like would trained winter driving snow covered road patch ice ect
waymo never happen lidar handle bad weather condition
yea wondering happen lidar get cm snow covering frozen layer ice think need least year development type car hit road many country
well tbf human dont really drive different snow bit slower turn le sharp anything certainly train ai adjust speed turning behavior snow
think one good solution would switch radarsonarother wavelength lidar installing beacon along side road intersection
think even driverless car better human imagine snowcovered road marking completely covered human driver would drive feel right driverless car car fleet driven road draw missing marking memory
look gave said pedestrian ran parked autonomous car three separate occasion lmao
wait pedestrian cyclist protestors learn trust waymo car learn step front anytime want
car hit argument kinda thing sometimes think im wasting money internet
extremely misleading characterization catiiiii operation general asiana crash particular additionally useful use aviation example discussion driverless car two environment far different mean one may well use example scuba diving argue space walk
rosemary harleigh said honestly driverless car perfected im favor im merely pointing video making inappropriate comparison using misleading explanation cherrypicked data advanced aircraft autopilotauto throttle system operate equivalent level automation use data point desirability selfdriving car level simply invalid argument also asiana crash yeah jet abovementioned system case misusing automation poor manual flying
actually technology required completely driverless city developing fairly time example autonomous car like tesla g g required communicate control center reliably
thing sound like hvacs
im scared data collection company already way knowing im going company life future
imagine arrogant believe single company want know whereabouts activity youtuber caldas personal level
carry phone time least self driving car track parking spot phone track every step
yeah care order make money send goon stalk
wait guy find phone carry everywhere location service used almost apps collect data
yeah afraid car rent company algorithm decide travel share car probably privacy inside either
make sense city bus half empty time ask one thing really grind gear tho mention speeding cause lot accident please dont spread b story thats backed science backed city making money speeding fine speeding cause accident reckless driving distracted driving speeding speeding accident likely fatality totally agree much nuance speeding ferarri v toyota corolla vastly different brake distance control
great vid background music little loud one
human better understanding situation needed sometimes automated system inevitably fail unless real ai wont time soon possibly never dont let corporate fraud mislead
already see car pile interstate kid idiot paranoid adult pressed emergency stop button reason
imagine space youd leave car front moment could slam anchor
every introvert want happen dont talk driver
uhm wtf happening
also redesign city usa car dependant theyve designed
yeah im northern maine well road dont lane mark old essentially nonexistent even many problem like vehicle seem tractor take rds entire road like would self driving car even nonetheless im skeptical new thing everyone want thing electric car well obviously awesome idea wouldnt want one live dont trust battery last long f weather quite common live say put garage well cost crap ton money keep large room heated especially normally dont form heating garage yeah im fan electric car fan hybrid
raise notable objection however ill note new tool doesnt perfect situation absolute undeniable upgrade previous status quo hey even electric car battery tech deep freezer friendly may work maine hear family many year there plenty space people could lead dramatic increase quality life
realize gas powered car battery stupid
id curious see sort simulation could taught car guess car would hopefully able pull side yield tractor scenario though im curious would stop block much road end farmer yelling back uphaha
live new hampshire ev get concern think youve overestimated impact first year didnt even garage put fine luckily home nonheated garage make charging lot convenient way necessary reap benefit owning ev
hawidaku aint stupid there difference gas powered car literally charge run need enough energy produce spark good thats need jump someone car take minute like hr like would completely recharge battery
hacked
live one part world sometimes stop sign disappears left support rod everybody life know stop sign place next generation driver get information somehow computer never
one reason waymo limited service area mapped everything support crew driving around looking new temporary hazard construction roadwork etc
thank amazing video think least achievement autonomous driverless car issue like car going flick cigarette throw trash unto street mental issue going cause problem driver road near future driving car human would become illegal probably allowed try fun activity controlled park somewhere one able drive road may seem little much sure coming year purchase family car longer need drive something like tesla thanks amazing video much appreciation
wondering lidar would still work lot car using lidar street
dont remember voted poll think thinking mythical future fewno manned vehicle road im anxious driver free vehicle dont like driving also paranoid getting car accident last accident caused someone paying attention turning lane left im driving make nervous im driving make nervous feel powerless anything driverless vehicle think would feel think vehicle road also driverless capacity communicate order mitigate accident mistake think would ready
say mythical future know many people like car like driving dont want take joy away
im future really feel taking equation making life easier safer make u lazy comfortable arent meant live life like make think walle movie idiocrasy havent watched two movie genuinely advise
driving hour work day make way le lazy god already lazy person train
could productive stuff car dunno dont think drastically cutting travel time going horse car made u anymore lazy
exactly based perspective looking want farmer use dozen people work field person ride vehicle maintain profit want write everything hand try understand people wrote better read printed document valid font want communicate paper electronic mail progress one side laziness side plenty opportunity time hobby growing mentally technology help move physical mental much better easier much valuable profit general want lowprogress life thirdworld country perfect example leave hightech country like japan live big mess country like chile peru zambia etc think hightech country better almost aspect
ive thinking psychological aspect maybe lot people like driving car sort control especially learn drive people feel like control anything life feel depressed im saying driverless car would one straw camel back speak think question point letting technology take control u become detriment u
test driving tried driver assistance several different car wasnt something going determine purchase since didnt trust test driving reinforcing opinion best subaru forester ended purchasing ive tested assistance scared point wont trust anything except emergency braking cruise control get confused easily there obvious snow covered road also much worse handling sun glare even interstate occasionally becomes confused simple thing like ramp drove road driving south amana iowa highway turned east onto highway towards iowa city lane centering assist adaptive cruise control enabled everything seemed normal car following initial long bend left tintersection homestead th avenue ahead right th avenue widens intersection allowing car wait sidebyside left right turn onto highway apparently assist recognize intersection decided split difference realized assist driven highway heading towards ditch allowed take control drive back onto highway two lane highway driving past opposing traffic prefer leaving bigger gap driving closer curb doesnt come close center line security issue
happens car using lidar overlap interfere lidar use different specrtums
yeah already providing machine mean navigate real world itselves mean skynet attack wont need provide hahahaha
hope soon possible people seriously get hurt reckless driving completely avoidable
dont actually know whole lot exactly lidar work say car close proximity chance another car lidar coming back reflection making picture individual car bit fuzzier curious tech work great arent many self driving car get worse there ton still camp much wanting self driving car im curious
asiana flightils requiring manual landing pilot unfamiliar landing without il failed maintain proper speed
driverless car might ready road arent ready environment isnt ready car able see without camera radar ready car need able communicate car road motorcycle etc etc etc driverless car ready car break plastic bag drift road road identify bag harmless communicate driverless car network automating car step
bold assume parking lot would converted something nonprofitable given opportunity
thing holding u back advancement fear stupidity human
wouldnt comfortable im one others driving around car
could prone malware nd virus like computer could casually plug usb hijack carspoiler theory heavily influenced watchdog
made computer right yes mean better computer travel safely computer
eliminate parking lot dont get part
idea dont need car every car taxi get random car get destination send car next customer need park
imagine autonomous car run company like google facebook twitter banning passenger wrong opinion censoring destination etc safety statistic
mount sentry gun deal road ragers
channel got love science
im looking forward widespread level level autonomous car even level would good enough basic road area
yeah sure dry street arizona ill feel better see run snow live thats year thats voted least year technology ready often turn traction control car get ice snow
im going refer comment poll mention point made still believe autonomous driving fully viable unless well majority car road autonomous consider average human average reflex situational awareness one drive actually obeys speed limit law know majority rule road yes vote going human one autonomous driving need yet dont think ever need way successful car road drive autonomously would basically eliminate accident traffic situation congestion get end accident anything go huh caused caused people hitting brake riding someone unnecessarily close another car cutting people causing successive car behind hit brake causing congestion autonomous driving plus average human meaning paying attention damn road surroundings ideal situation autonomous driving today unfortunately people idiot go hurr derr car work lem text snapchat paying attention road probably anyways autonomous car anyways guess im saying many stupid driver road unfortunately autonomous driving never fully viable option anytime soon driver bring average make wonder think ok abuse driving privilege like still absolutely love great driver get absolutely furious cycle speed limit clearly keeping passing traffic feel need ride as honk also wear jersey say stop ur txting thx backwards side really shouldnt aggravate people much guess people text drive dont like calling
sound car someone offscreen using leafblower sound loud somewhat highpitched normal carengine
prone human error software like imaging learning wrong thing billion mile nd want change smthg like inertia like human habit inertia break right true automated stuff code change forgets
new york due local law
speed ai development much faster u think
autolanding plane sunny day there something runway shouldnt though probably land right whereas pilot try goaround landing plane even dense fog still relatively easy procedure context well defined
arent gps bound really big deal
would comfortable everyone use trust ai reckless human driving
well darn get license automated car would still good people know drive manually anyways
mean whats scary driverless lift u year later whats scary driveless car year whats scary teleportation
driverless car great work kink technology solving problem like getting confused lane marking confusing lane marking plane landing airport equipment place plane computer us land available self driving car
dont trust gogle want track anonymously sell data
leaving tesla shame
ok im sold im going give driving fun regular commuting would great help realize machine may good human human often best machine always
person drive work van living shocked unbelievable amount people scrolling phone driving cant wait day longer worry well driver paying attention
think people miss whats achievable fully autonomous car commonplace absolutely people like derek also miss whats lost like imagine big tech gov censorship cancel culture today even ability track everywhere go rely phone also control everywhere go imagine say oh sorry political rally arent available destination nope youre allowed go protest driving may right privilege protected given easily
american learn train light rail challenge
real hurdle see limitation technology involved zero chance lidar camera unit functioning snowy environment way theyre designed vehicle great phoenix la vega much mountain colorado live work
improve public transport dont need car long tech take trickle common person
reason many people think theyre great driver take pride driving incorrectly getting away ive people brag driving speed limit zipping traffic getting wreck except wont always work itll take one slip one time one car youre speeding past decides jump front youre suddenly multicar pile majority vehicle automated yeah think would work fine though long driver human always group idiot think thrill seeking equal skill
speed doesnt cause accident might make fatal doesnt cause
uber driver go strike might get replaced automated car
ubers plan along
uber driver cant go strike officially selfemployed uber experimenting selfdriving car good
good
sane human feel ease one
im graduate college arizona degree computer science machine learning live area testing vehicle im always proud happening backyard someone born raised love tech exciting isnt much proud arizona right make excited future
id fine getting driverless car insurance company hedging bet car unpredictable human driver mean cant one id reliant service availability understand people live city used using taxi uber etc would ideal see niche thing every car drive autonomously derek hit topic watching ish
people like derek make future exciting
waiting see first autonomous black pontiac firebird trans driving around
im sorry dont need driverless car change mind
plane expected land exactly flight smoke cloud huge personal plane maybe even scared people onboard stayed air h fuel kinda low landed nearest airport situation really tense didnt get info googled look much worse dead h plane last h without water
sound good human car
maybe meant drive like human
good condition functional rest screwed basically useless moment unless use usa condition driven would want see drive country main road highway nice level road ok level road mostly bad would drive winter condition road different see line road road narrower would react situation country doubt would know stopping solution need train driverless system country country specific situation take many year really viable
year poor man still need drive year rich man still drive
already knew driverless car thing long time ago
woman sound smart
waiting watching snazzy lab video glad didnt disappoint
lidar work many car lidar would interfere
omg cant wait dont want talk driver lol
except one day someone going hack system kill lol
derek think misunderstand poll didnt say technology year away said selfdriving car wont ready year technology small part need law reglementations wide adoption also big social component need convince people work convincing humanity adopt something lifechanging easy task
problem selfdriving car isnt selfdriving car human driven car pedestrian animal etc theyre unpredictableunreliable element nothing proposition obviously converting everything selfdriving isnt going happen time near distant future way approach separated infrastructure dedicated autonomous vehicle lane etc
fun someone hack car
hate bring deviousness others people decide hate autonomous vehicle start using paint ball gun camera
could believe people believe driving average theyre actually right reason worst driver road bad common pull average far enough true arent enough spectacular driver pull average back probably applies accident likely caused people road
fraudulent take chicago winter trying dodge bullet criminal activity real world test
derek became sellout
cat landing manual flying comment way shallow channel go way deeper safety concern even bad weather landing manual landing cat cat minimum kind disappointed using example asiana generalize crew resource management aeronautical decision making
video sponsored waymo let talk video
real problem transition phase likely extremely long periodor endless quite easy change elevator likely alwaysin generation least bad human driver good autonomous driver sharing road wonder would mean insurance company autonomous vehicle road
youll never get though always people want drive
pretty sure going mean bankruptcy auto insurer except one insurer google one cover tesla
word insurance point insurer significantly raise premium human driven vehicle risk damage much higher sooooo much easier prove human source crash telemetrics
would make problem
stoutproper mean government enforce let say population human driver sticking around itll every politician interest make part election program
passenger safety would increase especially woman automation put extra strain mineral mining needed electronics
never considered parking lot wouldnt needed anymore imagine stepping walmart onto grass field
watch bike channel solution wrong
play need speed sitting autonomous car irony
dont like comparing machine learning x amount data human doesnt track computer dont learn way giving computer hour driving data would likely yield something thats extremely inconsistent incapable adaptation hour driving lesson human enough significant amount never crash life said point agree much safer human driver totally agree sentiment
hour even close enough good driver people think good driver reality average
waiting year know tech cant wait day buy one
wonder long itll take ai learn navigate urban thirdworld overpopulated city
comparison dumb youre comparing machine practically go machine constantly see process surroundings also way stuff control destroyed human error im self driving car think driving car many variable compared riding elevator shouldnt compared
think pointed lot plane manually flown visibility instrument board display information pilot need flight landing obviously still introduces element human error low visibility isnt really big deal landing
whole video come asterisk perfectly maintained road derek became sellout
nice see however think unfortunately long time used difficult traffic environment chandler arizona seems pretty much picture perfect place driving climate also seems nonissue location
ok trust autonomous car someone ram everyone use autonomous vehicle satisfactory level safety
elon left chat
generally love video havent mentioned single time car work predefined area information clarify dont think sponsor video furthermore excited technology generalpurpose autonomous vehicle still year away
impossible machine make question machine deal error im sure still load situation computer deal thats want option take control
hate break absolutely critical operation done computer already commercialindustrial situation perfect doesnt mean arent better human
dont trust happens child stuck inside car cop inside another car car sinking water car going save cop instead child chance survival cop higher
ive seen many blue screen death may phone freezing needing reset show happens car hardware software fail still safely pull side ill trust
like autonomous vehicle theory also want able drive hobby mine
driverless car great need focus pedestrian cycling space moving away car centric infrastructure whole point moving human b fast possible car centric street low walkablity big issue
im definitely bad driver never living city love hail driverless car go somewhere public transport cant get acceptable timeframe beautiful ballet probably really scary passenger first human passenger itll look like lot way close pass bit stop paying attention trusting wont crash city youd really want driverless public transport though car still take way much space switch hybrid model heavily frequented route get usual regular connection le frequented route use app indicate want get want go route made fly depending demand city live pilot project hail small seat electric bus bunch virtual stop city using app make route fly like outlined previous sentence bus still driver though doesnt make sense want get main station city center course use regular tram bus quite nice get suburb
even scary watching
look like lidar tech wayne enterprise
im missing debate enviromental implication one hand would probably drive efficient hand could use drive around empty example partner car drive work back tour share one car drive alone get tour
camera right next lidar car made sudden stop maybe confused ai used object close lidar
still want car even selfdriving
one going stop
sound great reason threat hackingterrorism wasnt discussed video seems obvious problem rather taking care life hope targeted mean hacking whats stopping someone required hacking ability cause absolute carnage could video veritasium im still interested learn fully autonomous way forward
question consume product excited new product
hacking issue please explain im convinced even know youre talking honest
bludmoon gg emp
problem driverless car phoenix represent really controlled environment city straight line clear road demarcation come europe still mostly modernized area term road youll see lot weird road marking many worst problem driverless vehicle perform perfectly youll need remove driver human pedestrian also personally big problem hacking plane exemple kind autonomous lot redundancy lot maintenance security protect million car hacking
would ideal future sometimes even get scared crossing road autonomous car would reason
solution isnt car narrowing road better public transport watch bike channel
prove isnt driven remote control
technology cool however testing different enviroments semi desert like northern cold state appalachian mountain driving condition road condition different
speeding doesnt cause crashing thats complete myth inattentiveness wheel cause crashing speed limit mostly arbitrary number isnt even set particular situation part road time set stretch road based person belief limit speed limit changed number year kph faster mean sudden every crash happens klms new speed limit caused speeding reality crashing far le likely velocity zero likelihood crash zero every traffic incident speed limit including life threatening incident saying joanne bloggs suddenly decides drive kph kph zone shes upset life feeling blue unsafe definitely im saying speeding get blame fact human error time speeding use australian speed limit distance travel atrociously slow fastest limit kph rare stretch road speed kph allow driver much attentive wheel say kph speed limit boredom traffic incident speeding even kph
everyone reaction time concentration better stick lower speed everyone rossi vettel
stiano average reaction time m youre bringing reaction time tell arent attentive driver surprised traffic arent paying attention look road something motorcyclist ensure safety allows see potential problem anywhere near giving ten second react prepare
actually land time time aircraft land visibility showed extremely rare way put seems like rarely pilot actually land reality land manually time pilot
sadly k autonomous vehicle ton lidar never affordable average consumer well least lidar come price lot
ballay car carrefour bad idea pedestrian still cross road big part car trafic could resolve traintrambicycle autonomus car good answer trafic issue answer certain type commit car still dominante enough money invest public transport think lobby hand hand toxic masculinty playing huge role youtuber make critique revolutionnary transport like hyperloop musk thing explain better
accident people hit stationary wamo car need auto car asap
tesla cry corner
cry laughter thing drive radar lidar bunch tracking people street lol
comparison tesla video soon really want hear difference well explained
actually recent accident sdc would still accident driver front slammed brake well didnt wreck semi truck rear ended scenario happened sdc would also smashed
ok channel way become vlog
love progress goal would make invisible slowly put regular car mercedes class year everywhere tesla much le data learning hand eliminate risk using data already video make happy looking forward road trip driver able play desk game passenger
used pizza delivery driver year time avoided collision wouldnt fault time people hit car wasnt time people hit car experience people cant drive safely
say event come car avoid something ie log fall lorry car choose swerve left motorbike killing rider preserving passenger right lorry lorry driver probably fine maybe mot passenger surely people buy car protect first foremost
easy stop hope youre imagining log falling like back truck long vertical log suddenly somehow manages slip loose thats likely say load log get loose strap come fell side truck camera vehicle would see right away likely vehicle would slow stop well truck moving log would fall front van one would get hit unless autonomous vehicle got rearended suddenly stopping
ybunnygurl motor way driving km hour take long time bring car stop
human garbage driving would know driver fact human garbage almost every task cant wait machine fully takeover driving
problem driverless car two see first theyre programmed human always error second human driving car seems problem
know whats better driverless car car imagine place dont waste lot space car park road everything suddenly get walking cycling distance longer distance bridged train bus getting stuck traffic dependence car finally convenient life
lmao whats fun
fully autonomous car car drive condition equal rain fog snow night sun glare unexpected visual scene automated flying totally different unexpected object
make car say train going fully automatic transportation complicate system making sea expensive autonomous vehicle instead autonomous tram train would certainly increase number transportable passenger per unit area also would safer cheaper imagine world selfdriving car would used outskirt outside city
airplane waaaay space vehicle equal waaaay reaction time processing time still think mixed system driver autonomous gon na hard hard nut crack really right need networktype architecture think packet totally autonomous system
also way predictable certain amount variable like wind change etc car lot crazy people road dont drive predictable eg look people run standing car also question legal reliability mistake fault computer mistake maybe situation could done differently responsibilty nevertheless suck course end would much safer car would drive city autonomous
agree network approach move afoot europe standard vehicle comms network broadcasting status information human autonomous car following vehicle know nearly instantly front one slam brake vehicle breaking speed limit jump red light take many year roll trying intercept end fossil fuel vehicle
networking car autonomous setup would introduce wide net security issue doesnt matter good encryption secure system bad actor infiltrate company server one idiot intern email usb stick accidentally dropped outside office theyd also target foreign country attack wanted cyber warfare
arkanrais mmm dont think besides networking vehicle given actually talking architecture system individual car would routed totally autonomous network road similar way packet telecom system
add voice recording driver accent complaining marriage problem entire ride add realism
remember episode mythbusters maybe natgeo imitator didnt know tried test movie trope pilot incapacitated dead civilian land plane guidance air traffic control turn autopilot sophisticated air traffic control tell switch autopilot turn knob adjust setting plane virtually fly land
driverless sound awesome cost buy one waymo dollar month understandable great day
give want
many hit like button even watching
theyve driving million mile already thats amazing million mile road phoenix thats massive subset driving condition u let alone entire world car diving blinding snow condition little traction covered road marking waymo car arent going see wide adoption need driving billion mile much diverse set condition let tightly controlled sandbox phoenix still react faster unknown situation potential accident human
live chandler interact vehicle daily basis usually multiple time per day didnt realize fully autonomous used allow passenger sit driver seat seem mingle traffic well like get speed limit unusually quick dont feel like slowing oh dang think wrote commercial endorsement waymo folksdo get paid
eliminate parking lot add green space city dont need autonomous car need humancentered urban planning
comment need upvotes
""
exactly public transportation subway train average joe never able afford kind car project involve automating regular car instead building new one scratch find lot interesting
yes yes
thibautmodrzyk public transportion important definitely agree idea fleet autonomous car dont car anymore summon one need
fueling
rate accident property damage per million vehicle mile regular driver definitely coming along impressive rate per stats would accident per million vehicle mile
little know john cena actually driver
estonia also showed selfdriving car university tartu private company called bolt cooperation developing selfdriving car
waymo geofenced av scalable
may economically scalable yet neither personal computer mobile telephone least first
shammyh dont mean economically also neural net approach scalable winner take situation one best data win like google almost insurmountable lead search ai tesla x real world data self driving system combined gap widening accelerating pace one work worldwide
awesome disadvantage see driver going jobless time would increase demand technical worker guess even
bug people act like human disgusting dangerous creature cant trusted freedom like
educational important information class least insurance cheaper speed thing paint car black put moving red dot light front find hasselhof interested owning one
sad see obviously sponsored biased video summarize driver error always cause accidentsfatalities data provided many case could avoided driverless car video rail bad human driving look driver training requirement thats shouldnt surprise grandmother barely see still license dont make public transportation better everyone shouldnt drive dont feel comfortable driving doesnt lot question like covered video
maybe video driverless car public transportation statistic kill argument anyway driverless car better safer driver thats
driver error car maintained cause accident
think solution road problem good public transportation electric bus light rail subway
reason obviously sponsored mentioned start video one claiming sponsored
personal self driving car x better public transportation specific instead get pre determined stop faster dont wait stop people get comfortable people dont want sit next bunch nasty stranger would bad thing develop form transportation
totally sold hope uk catch soon
pretty irresponsible video guy unfortunate
practical reason car painted white computer see better cheaper
drove around deserted quiet street real city traffic
one first
chicago road wont convinced handle construction zone pothole seriously damage car learn drive avoid pothole time
huh physic girl yet
would trust driverless car
might solution save life solution traffic imagine around car minute street autonomous car around
drive truck gps speed limiter allowed drive faster speed limit driving strange thing truck unable downshift using gas pedal raise rpm synch gear like use time computer dont want accelerate truck reached speed limit exemple driving city highway speed limit kmh getting highway enable raise rpm downshift truck speed reached kmh speed service road talking bad driver well tuck driver tell single day road semi hand show dangerous road road much bad dangerous driver im perfect im waiting patiently put semi autonomous truck road hope ill drive one retired
think driverless car could worked particular case grandmother village one narrow road connecting major road syste road go hill forested area width road sometimes normal road least narrow road zone car could park example opposing side car meet one car would go back could find place like road clear continue travel fully autonomus car procedure situation like go grandmother house situation happens
fact dont accept encourage highly developed cheap tesla car go lidar ugly looking expensive vehicle someone sponsoring doesnt mean good
lidar better scientific reason worse economic reseasons
someone much money tesla stock
fair waymo invented category also actually fully autonomous car road sometime tesla tesla may end effective low cost solution yet
slyfer dont buy stocksim u
ive car accident point dont trust people driver im ready automobile
think problem driverless car good enough problem people ready accept stem variable control computer basically expects almost ideal driving behavior driver id trust car highway driverless add erroneous human driver equation apprehension arises
driverless car amazing theyre hard make everyone know however wont successful product place driving hard traffic unpredictable might successful city traffic good driver actually respect law place driver unpredictable time dont really respect law
veritasium driverless car already brain driverless cat already click fast possible
try xkcd substitution
im concerned individual automated car im concerned automated car come network security right car computer bug al doesnt matter control important part vehicle cyber terrorism rise dont fully trust digital network ever connected internet increase complexity system becomes robust small failure weak catastrophic failure personally think bigger problem world worth investing vehicle death generally technology pad pocket big tech billionaire real threat life livelihood bad driver
kinda make think ever want consider striking
whole time thinking oh yes oh thats awesome oh yeah
disliked turned second doesnt matter felt ride went paid subject patron vested interest say say dont say dont say compromised science objectivity go waymo window big tobacco big oil big auto big pharma big ag big tech disapointed
would thiscar able read signal car surrounding like example let say person wanted take exit right thought bit late turn indicator take turn autonomous car cant read indication car could end hitting car came front making sudden stop causing car behind crash would work well car communicating sensor outside car like road traffic light could feed data car
sort driverless car would like coming person really enjoys driving would one take control want drive feeling tired night drinking could tell take point feelin right would take problem
aurora literally copy pasted someone el comment lmao
want buy one
cool
cgp grey laughing
exactly one saddest cause accident run relative child couldnt see tall enough backup camera waymo deal exact situation couldnt see demo camera angle video seemed blind spot bumper height object must taken care must wrong yes
think missed fact vehicle road theyll share information theyre seeing increasing safety doubt whether something human bag blowing across road weird example know suddenly vehicle communicate one see bag neighbor see human theyll correct take caution essence data car work go one location horisontal direction
person think waymo sound like whammo
would love sit backseat work etc basically taking bus
except wont take hour go mile
personal space nonrigid schedule probably way safer like public transportation important sure itd impossible fully get car road might well make better
except go parent driveway instead bus depot departs feel like dont get puked kid sitting next
thinking thing imagine uber lyft transitioning company adding fully autonomous vehicle convenience quick uber safety even convenience needing human working area pick order car sends one right away personal dont worry sitting next random people spreading illness many thing im loving driverless car future imagine sign subscription sends car address every single work day exact time select time day pay monthly payment happen take work every day commuting dont order car every morning lol
mastermike proper public transportation system ie nowhere america apparently youll bus every minute le bus stop le one two minute away departure arrival point also amount bus adjusted number people using youll rarely even sit next sick kid work people living city already vast majority car road live isolated could either take car neareast bus stop train station doesnt job case private car shared driverless car way go last resort first one everybody
moral machine test stupid want machine think like human giving super robotic test oh child man blocking road sense capable person world time think hmm one run people would try avoid cost swerving car go way crashing better use resource make super safe passenger worst happens swerve crash safely saving passenger pedestrian
dont need door open slowly tho drive dont care rest
exciting riding roller coaster
ad guy take grain salt company seeking funding
interesting response raining snowing bad visibility camera laser
know im sure might stumped thinking technology overcoming problem problem excited highly heated camera casing melt snow soon hit car using collective network short range laser paint entire location car heavy downpour etc
much protected hacker attack biggest threat autonomous car didnt even touched subject
waymo vehicle rely external communication drive problem one mitigated going completely offline
one reason level driverless certain condition hence project innsuch hot area work project much smaller company target requirement help radar resistant weather get dangerous situation stop side road case sudden bad weather
mithemer ooh company
worry road good climate snow covered road dead winter going work well think
car cool lidar super expensive everyone using car time morning go job example fleet necessary would immense
true car general spend time parked
u small town folk wait fair bit longer assume since poorly mapped road poorly maintained road would difficult self driven car avoid rely
many poorly mapped road plus le traffic otherwise staying semi centered gravel road avoiding pothole
quite people first talked seriously driverless car first thought phoenix almost perfect grid system two lane direction nearly everywhere even shear rock cliff climbing desert need two lane leading away meanwhile rural england main road village isnt wide enough whole way two car pas knowledge horse cow psychology occasionally useful driving around along bad pothole keep changing dont want neigh sayer pun intended dont think would hard better driver time certainly motorway long stretch pretty good driving record hand back road next town got gridlocked day many car trying use road insufficient passing space got chat driver turning around inch perfect passing many car truck back way come take main road instead even driver thought wrong turn around
derp inshmurtz village predate british empire probably roman empire natural spring easily defensible high ground fertile land well sea level theyll people another year hope arent subsistence farmer
approach waymo taking never work u small towner tesla visiononly approach built work anywhere world waymo essentially roller coaster much rail due premapped area
way biased video filled sale pitch phrase
understand partially automated airplane fully automated elevator achieved one thing consider interaction car much much interaction plane elevator virtually none immediate future im optimistic much much safer statistically fully automated car car driver car must completely locally controlled minimal interaction open network reduce remote attack risk automated car safer per million billion car much much fragile cyber attack glitch liability insurance point view well figure implication another scenario hybrid model autonomous driver driven car road need irrational driver cause major disruption entire car system im personally much favor autonomous car lane like public bus reduces risk complexity also help immediately identify errant automated car reduced risk
handle poor weather driving rain cause backup camera get mucked water dirt good camera going handle semi truck passing highway spewing cloud road grime water
renault one year
let take people let car use road say let figure going get around
well think outta test tesla
cant wait see self driving car india
stand beside main road watch people drive feel like people phone face distracted something else get driverless car asap
thank taking johnny cab hope enjoyed ride
find weird people still think technology far away fact politics lagging behind
soon well world people hopeless without coddled technology
trust driverless car drive complicated road like india
seriously read driverless cat already instantly clicked
poll month old video took month
noticed lady brazilian accent
cant wait norm would feel much safer road
information power originally id said werent ready go number test billion mile etc id say yes ready important question give lift home youre drunk
used driver company used google map even though great program sometimes told drive construction side oneway road private property road resident one time even military base also frequently failing find address manually look specific house number road especially countryside live germany might different u still wonder company address problem human longer able take control vehicle
live usa havent google map make error term car navigation probably year longer
shammyh thats interesting see many difference country german town street actually name werent build reactangual order usually complete mess think also people use google map u making better still would expected least major mistake country especially countryside
id really like know would neighborhood many car parked street sometimes terribly parked enough room fit two car
sound like car waymo experience driving u
take thumb get
isnt still dude decides car data bringing hour back experience nerd probably drive escooter
died would like fault lmao
thats right get rid human
call overpopulation control
derek say driveless car closer think adam conover say theyre far away think dont know believe
someone decides hijack driverless car
veritasium make entertaining infomercial
driverless car waymore useful think
asshole mode turn
zero apprehension driverless car fewer reckless human driving two ton steel mph better
wait driverless car hate wasted time spend getting place would love able read book nap
derek mentioned airplane bad weather didnt mention fact waymo chose phoenix lack rain snow hoping educational video le commercial know sponsored thought youd mention competitor bit comparison
used bat technology nice
car definitely safer human exception every country different road law system tweaked even retrained also malfunction like cable etc ai system also throw reliable happen brake fail electronic signal steering stop im talking interface software hardware
aboveaverage driver actually make sense really bad people dont know drive people thought abovemedian driver thats wouldnt make sense
man car must much anxiety imagining possible scenario
oh god car hot looking computes billion possibility
realchezboi mmmm look model classic
ai car thing work like human brain
imagine car suddenly stop middle road anxiety attack xd
realchezboi billion possibility one girl car would go date
rode driverless train blew mind thinking go track relate experience
try stunt london double total accident score one day
kind wasteful technology leading destruction biosphere environment human civilizationtechno utopian techno optimist never understand store shelf empty house fire underwater gang starving people preparing make meal much worse certainly wayand much sooner science crystal clear denial psychology built uswe refuse act logical manner refuse act way acknowledges alive biosphere environment everything else day bullshite
problem country underdeveloped road people dont stay lane okay wont seeing around philippine anytime soon
public road
deer road wildlife
got question driver seat cyber security risk badge look lot like chrysler
pedestrian ran vehicle thats interesting
sound like blow tho
long coded elon musk see bright future self driving car
driverless car love
worry fixing wrong problem need car technology investment v putting resource public transportation human friendly city design army automated taxi continuing use expensive unsustainable infrastructure taxpayer fund seems like socialism corporation
autonomous vehicle make human operated vehicle obsolete encourage people use combination public transportationautonomous vehicle get around public transportation going get much better investment california ny demonstrated cost run investment go project never get finished get public transportation would require reconfiguring design distribute housing encourage public transit use thats different issue altogether may possibly helped autonomous vehicle
think address point implies driverless car would shared resource public car arent parked used move people time work surely would expand mass transportation like bus
exactly benefit large company mean autonomy eroded mention million job lost replaced job pay le provide le autonomy one basic need
missing environmentally friendly car electric fewer need created since dont need youre one le pollution spill accident le car needing thrown away since crashed additionally car train multiple car ride together combined lower speed autonomous car since keep speed limit reduce air resistance reduce electric consumption make u rely le energy production could go get good enough wont even need train since coordinated prevent jam go faster highway without increasing risk
really trying solve bad driver problem thats helpful side effect make thing easier driver make luxury car appealing bonus feature like
little box thing text look like detroitbecome human choice
im concerned cyber security aspect sure tech may great someone malicious get ahold ride theyre driving car kidnapping without ever even touch
ok disrupt autonomous vehicle blasting siren lol
thing self driving car never replace human driver safer need almost perfect single death caused weight lot mind several one caused human error also need conveniant car human driver stopping second every time potential threat found simply acceptable passenger course could see forced transition towards self driving car government car insurance company decide encourage usedeter driving finally self driving car arriving time large urban center rich country trying reduce number vehicle road proliferation self driving car could go goal technology ever emerges think bound niche scenario rather massive scale
humankind time innovation
bet cant handle blizzard thats im coming say theyre yet
similar many older generation still refuse use map gps rely memory direction skill see gps become commonplace high hope autonomous vehicle well would expect people completely adjust unless medium outlet keep flaming small accident somewhere biggest disaster
take fully autonomous find parking spot
many nonlevel car already
automatic teller machine emerged people hesitant using get money bank preferred person inside bank process transaction
different situation
sheridantank get safety aspect trusting technology lot safer human error factor personally love idea driverless car
thanks many reason list
least kind enough disclose sponsorship fun fact autonomous car massive scam there great interview yt reasontv geek coded program make car autonomously driving vehicle smartphone connector plug electrical readout plug car newer code open source free turn car autonomously driving car without gigantic pricetag hundred pound sensor weight basically network data station wheel
cant wait
hum see colombia year lucky
sad whole video waymos rather narrow approach vehicle autonomy tesla approach visionai way wholeistic look le flashy mile ahead true general autonomy
aunt mine elevator driver right thats backwards rest world
someone clarify reduction parking lot self driving car kinda confused part
autonomous car drop go need park
mehdicirtensis would still want autonomous car whether physically drive therefore would still need park
idea use fully autonomous car like cab service youd call get dropped would go next person need call another youre done presumably theyd go back hq automatically refuelingcharging though im sure would eventually model available public purchase honestly peruse fee low enough wait short enough bother owning car anything road trip
sinhurr dont want take cab car personal space like customize interior like keep stuff even something simple sunglass wear car hairbrush elastic spare change cup holder reusable grocery bag extra set clothes shoe often prepack car night dont forget something dont want sit space shared people cant freely touch without wondering clean thats car probably big reason people car therefore reason parking lot disappear people car would still want autonomous car reason one
travel around menlo park palo alto horrible racing
think would great human driver would vanish road id personally better public transportation everyone rather fully autonomous car everywhere
want drive car like car fun drive
ditto ride tofrom airport dont need r chrysler pacifica driven robot fine
good luck driving vietnam asian country proud
vehicle waymo experience human
night
auto insurance company disliked video
really surprising love driving mean safer transport ill happily give future
someone video vehicle work different situation weathersroad construction redirectionsnowrainfogaccident ahead police directing traffic etc etc
got learner permit watching like wait wan na drive
sarcastic ritoric question future car driven ai would like drive racing circle dependent technological change person push pedal looking parking place imagine drink eat sleep use network without road interruption
maksymisaiev absolutely love technology behind driverless car think improves safety heap agree convenient still would want ability drive havent even gotten p yet something freeing control vehicle take anywhere go plane boat ive also experience piloting something experience match
young fellow let tell getting sent errand parent feeling lazy get old hella quick
zach vogel absolutely much better suited transportation complex area traffic like city precision driving needed traffic flow think future transportation sort split
ziggybadans unless ride bad area like thirdworld country density peoplevehicles huge bad road culture east europe central asia change opinion tried learn ride hard experience even passenger doesnt make fill comfortable much better road like western europe receive driver license
emergency need take someone hospital injured person doesnt luxury waiting ambulance need run red light take shortcut decision prohibited selfdriving car take solution situation
autonomous vehicle hack proof
would like car connected car sensor streetstop light car connect imagine possibility
autonomous car best future possible people go want drive love drive way go love motor noise gasoline smell electric car love shoot go shooting camp shooting people street car go racing track fun dont go messing city traffic killing people
real question whether car included fast furious movie
self driving car drive indian road faith technology
even ai car deliberately executed people year would still order magnitude safer human driver
wamos technology limited unlikely work outside small defined area im sure others said already check telsas technology
equivalent mechanical horse really car extremely inefficient mean transportation many measure would better served robustconvenientcomfortableaffordable communal system rather creating overcomplicated solution fit fundamentally terrible system eliminate parking lot add green space add walking space eliminate road dramatically reduce cost reduce pollution asphalt vehicle exhaust noise reduce crime increase tourism virtually eliminate fatality etc investment high quality communal transportation system
communal system issue slow inconvenient also still pandemic please keep germ
there difference whats possible whats likely private car going anywhere foreseeable future
markp slow inconvenient careful confuse experience possible system many place world would challenge statement
thejudge depends investment city narrowing road increasing public transportation meaningfully first time decade hope expansion continues absolute dont think motor vehicle disappear believe increase communal system positive ramification measure proportion proliferation
seanlumly really please name place bus drive home office directly mall need train none none issue resolved communal transportation also ignored entire pandemic angle guess cause doesnt fit narrative bus train suddenly getting better
wonder extra weight use electronics economyefficiency car
transportation get cheaperadd milions jobless driver pressure family budget even people affected showed also con exclusively pro
computer obviously capable safer driver human acting like theyre infallible ridiculous think computer phone charge driving next time get window update something tell impossible computer make mistake
camera vehicle stop functioning
well car handle damage
love one main concern driverless car pay anything go wrong prevent thing going wrong doesnt matter care someone responsible case something happen
biggest issue driverless car much extra programming deal poor unpredictable human driver would almost zero problem zero accident driving switched driverless
like hypothetical moral scenario especially consider human would react hit dont even notice brain unable process fast
dont perfect better human painfully low bar jump
im robot worth
appreciated comment
transcribing book selfdriving car wonder next captchas timmy dropped large dictionary foot type one word may describe reaction
jacobshirley pain
whether better average driver know traffic light look like better ever
jacobshirley youve tasked making many paperclip percent universe think might turned paperclip scenario action think human might find unsatisfying
every driverless car gangsta try uk road
wait till tell train bus idk people get psyched commute car dont drive current public transportation idea know infustructure isnt present west usa go think solid subway system big city like east coast would great self driving car still super improvement distracted disabled people want get around agree
everyone else hmm sound good audibmwguys way drive mph speed limit anymore
im curious laserdistance technology work self driving car utilising laser technology receive others laser cant imagine dont also seems like important thing figure self driving car arent useful one every metre
cell phone ignore person next get message call concept light bouncing around bigger issue lidar expensive cant read speed limit sign traffic light whatnot
maybe driving car different amplitude frequency laser distinguish
chat giving micro second gap filter junction mph
one many optical issue using laser face resolved simple term laser encoded lidar system acknowledge light signature plus lidar system us multiple laser although one two maybe adversly affected nonself light would quickly resolve system update light source also important remember lidar one component detection system radar visual camera also important various form sensor work together produce integrated coherent picture world event lidar picked wrong signal would sync element
oh ofcourse guy without helmate indian
problem always see new stuff like cyber security dont wan na get filmed car like dont want gps data getting track ridding car like data important stuff data make dont want give big tech company
well im glad dont use phone gps navigation
phone
info info
driverless car year away driverless car sense washer machine humanless washer work yes scrubbing cloth washing well every way human enough get job done car driverless limited calling hurt entirety driverless vehicle tesla many company tesla clearly top real autonomy driverless work road programed road scenario dont get wrong extremely cool like tech dont like limitation honestly biden proposed huge expensive infrastructure change id like plan come new car standard light imagine every intersection altered new box communicating car would able see waiting going car talk ask many behind get real time traffic data wait time allowing smoother traffic safer road everything autonomous thing though need infrastructure first something like exist
say goodbye another freedom become dependent human being
yeah there fear government try take away people freedom movement using safety excuse making car selfdriving even enforcing system centralized control vehicle im assuming every time something get done get le le effect allowed le le potentially dangerous debated
right come developing country youll realize stupid self driving car idea doest matter country good road technology simply ready shocked see autonomous car public road
inevitable potentially soon enough could norm near future
yes need self driving car quite simply statistic show suck driving many distraction human multitaskthat computer term something never able better computer sure odd first enjoy driving time id gladly give knowing car next isnt distracted human computer weighing variable every second road also think traffic reason people cant figure merge self driven car able talk one another calculate best speed collaboratively boomtraffic gone
im sure plane v car analogy fair airliner way larger way complicated car time plane evolved vehicle actually undrivable human many situation hence test asked small aircraft pilot try land airliner simulator see passenger could talked landing procedure weve seen tv answer opposite true put regular car driver truck stop truck short time able operate
term implication people quality life already called uber
youre full autonomous vehicle drive small area certain city heavily mapped road layout ever change car totally screw data updated arbitrary autonomous driving anywhere road isnt something waymo tesla getting close eventually get waymos heavy reliance mapping isnt answer
ive never driven fully autonomous car tell id feel safer driven one driven mother law
nice minute ad main issue isnt driverless car like waymo one dont work arent safe viably work taxi heavily restricted area cost lot money require human intervention everything except drive
sponsored video ok unbiased review competition tesla
could strap bunch light blind sensor car change car paint reflective like stealth fighter jet make car invisible car camera
well everyone driving driverless car communicate avoid traffic jam avoid accident organize road crossing etc
yeah lol perfectly possible since process billion bit information past experience dont think much stretch make connect process information car
literally every arizona suburb happens look like set breaking bad
hardest part driverless car traffic traffic autonomous car van bus communicate traffic incident traffeling get kinda boring though also lot efficient
im full support feel like sort double edge sword making u human even le aware doubt incredible safe great technology many purpose though
level autonomy human interaction needed level want
monkey fear cant control altho computercontrolled car better driver well coded fear least still power thing could take control wheel time would
wait someone else decides dont get go b wait politician decides stop personal travel whatever reason car freedom people already giving freedom safer theyll give freedom convenience
oooor instead autonomous car could fund public transportation problem traffic car isnt much human driver car taking space energy single tram line carry people entire freeway banning people street entirely autonomous car even worse way livable urban environment
who money
derik completely forgot taxi public transport thing talking biggest implication old blind disabled transport wat
sheridantank think road financed better invest money efficient public transportation rather road waste lot space
ya thinking plus car going cheap instead
completely agree better invest public transportation cycling walkable city way design city sustainable also liveable
cant wait till everybody else driverless car
great price within range avoid driving due persistent stress thinking extremely prone accident
sound loud sound like jet engine due electronics needing cooled much energy car consume compared normal car
question lidar still work every car road one car interference free ofcourse busy intersection traffic jam enough different wavelength
truly believe mitochondrion powerhouse cell
yes filtering done lidar state art
nearly lidar system model use wavelength could become issue something like discrete transponder code werent implemented like done done aircraft radar system would still quite rare interference occur discounted especially considering safety passenger involved relying solely lidar make decision also bad idea
telsa doesnt use lidar camera better hopefully smaller company follow big dog
im guessing itll work similar bluetooth ghz wifi work channel hopping
good im glad ai taking human worst driving especially california need stay foot car front would zero traffic
cant wait people use accident evidence self driving car dont work
already like covid denier claim dont die covid whereas soon someone died vaccinated claimed vaccination must cause
tbh theyve involved lot accident though thats theyd like believe first nine month total waymos vehicle involved accident pedestrian cyclist driver object experienced disengagement time human driver forced take control likely would otherwise resulted accident
matkatamiba version car though giving stats based older model mean nothing current one advanced
darkknight article released month ago
matkatamiba alright ill check later
meanwhile communist taking away job million driver
there guy youtube ride tesla around lidar camera simulated graphic corner see reacts different situation really interesting
fyi tesla doesnt lidar dont even use radar anymore approach self driving visual image see generated actual camera footage
important topic left hacking malicious attack misleading car go etc
part world road arent maintained driver dont necessarily maintain lane im indian feel personally attacked
im ohio
like uk many pothole lot driver motorway constanly swap lane due slow driver inside lane driver hog middle lane forcing driver inside lane cross lane outside lane swoop back across lane inside lane even large road side sign telling driver get middle lane driver thick dont understand sign also horn honking driver keep merry middle lane causing havoc would great see driverless car cope dumbwits
southeast asia called
pittsburgh say hey feel seen
im italian feel personally attacked
blind personi seriously looking forward study computer science seen world changing impact learning model make great video
think put dummy driver driving seat people would somehow fear le sitting car
inflatable pilot like airplane
im driverless vehicle technology mean waymoalphabet serious taking car road reducing emission reducing traffic creating le pavement green space etc etc would investing autonomous public transport people take en masse using computing take away job taxirideshare driver
driverless car open huge amount free time people yes scary think overall itll save lot life
th century people killed road wow wildly deceptive stat context seen driving work many country chaotic free almost one west would feel safe around taxi going wrong way highway regularly intentionally massive intersection everyone want people walking inch massive truck motorcycle small vehicle packed like big rig etc yet people see video theyre going imagine western road thats majority audience
lol watcher westerner ask everyone comment whats country brom asia billion population call eastern
got ta show video dad
sneak peak future
get place road necessarily well maintained people dont stay lain would hard computer drive place world dont get wrong car coming yet
well got ta expect audience gon na westerner living first world country tech would actually work
im sure road u far le wellmaintained might think undergoing infrastructure crisis present still good enough selfdriving car many road video especially shiny minimum bar wellmaintained waaay lower country world already plenty road good enough selfdriving car operate safely addition place vast majority population still pedestrian lot option implement technology country driverheavy driverdependent like u selfdriving car stay lane dont share road human driver wont mean country walking bicycle used there flexibility thing like ban human driver road make selfdriving wouldnt work u many u city layout barrier make traveling foot bicycle impossible illegal driver flexible country would happy forced change route switch bicycle walking much population would unaffected change far people country nondriver general easier safer pedestrian bicyclist road selfdriving car road human driver
disciplined human v automatic car human win human v automatic car robot win edit yes know robot win remember year robot good guy underestimating human
im actually quite certain first part hold human still constrained reaction time
disciplined driver drop something diverts attention pick child scream back seat take attention road even brief moment autonomous braking system already wildly available today try buying new car without forward looking camera ill wait human even disciplined human arent perfect
robot win time average
shammyh similarly robotic car perfect
magao yeah true robot also perfect yes sense reaction time much slower
people think better average question combine two group control vehicle people obey traffic law better people group accident completely different reason waymo find city build convert high occupancy lane autonomous lane increase speed limit people get comfortable people see car speeding past traffic jam mph come
transportation drive yes please could use time important matter
agree also would purchase one would call one needed finished would sod someone else back charger future great sure dingbat screw thing
biggest fear autonomic car car privat company government potentially track easy never
late phone know know reason company government use phone
know google captcha made self driving car google car ai guess sidewalk traffic light show photo real people confirmsupdates idea sidewalk long time ago needed enter number letter photo character detection needed enter house number google map think really smart
thats funny illogical thats mean robot break captcha earlier
fact thats actually genius idea thats
well google made easy money free always
ascientistsjourney literally watching video platform owned google use free arent providing service return
ascientistsjourney always used actual way one click confirmed robot redoo test lot time per day add questionary somethings like bike
mind blowing thank derek great content let get channel million sub
uploading video olympics start
future lied car imagined
car would also even safer every car autonomous could communicate however always people say deserve privacy drive thing say carry around phone lol edit sad thing however loss work driver sure car need coder engineer often taxi driver sort experience dont know code mean deserve fewer job
yeah phone know every thing privacy modern world
thats one loud car
nice veritasium video see month
human problem attention
world sort technology readily available one want live damn feel good hear around corner
bring wheeled box india see many centimeter drive
delamain sound different
solved ethical legal problem come technology expect lobby legislation absolves responsibility choice software make
reminds joke saw somewhere nowadays cockpit modern comercial plane need pilot dog pilot feed dog dog make sure pilot doesnt touch anything
theyre going give wellknown tester perfect planned route ideal experience waymo ceo admitted doesnt think selfdriving technology ever able operate possible condition without human interaction tech crazy expensive almost larger hindrance seeing adoption well theyre better average driver stuff like guy cross walk dumb error ai make
say lot confidence little evidence
shammyh ive worked cruise know people working tesla waymo preplanned tested route vip
matkatamiba uh huh tote
human need apply
ultron right
im ready
every indian junction ballet vehicle
quite ballet work
chemist tell people die road accident india every single day
cimlite wikipedia people die every year crash u roadway u traffic fatality rate death per inhabitant
chemist better metric look car rather people since thats obviously going huge factor per motor vehicle every year there death india number u dont know define work wouldnt call number great
cimlite india population billion thats europe north america combinedobviously death
id take driverless car today car driver day
surprise people consider self average driver huge discrepancy people think make good driver vastly different idea balance safety efficiency car integrated city way transport course lot people consider self great lot consider terrible vice versa
perception whats possible limited experience example people never thought would go moon next decade moon landing everyone expected temporary moon base next decade last time went moon
dont tell chinese
lidar car doesnt work rain right seems like niche market develop selfdriving car work almost exclusivly arizona
radar rain good lidar rain backup
dont think waymo work india anytime soon
lidar radar necessary
machine learning car learn others mistake
roommate tell would never happen
dream world never drive ever dont want
unemployed uber taxi driver important think social impact ti kind tec
wish born developed firstworld country
fantastic tech course however come big problem silly variant trolley problem different ethical problem large portion work force directly tied business transporting good people happens people suddenly replaced automated tech simultaneously world economy u tested deal unemployment rate high
work developing better self driving building car work thing like science
would much better video hadnt sponsored waymo raise question whether subjective evaluation relative risk influenced paid even unconsciously please consider video important interesting topic sponsored video example keep emphasizing type accident human get self driving car wouldnt like distracted driving drunk driving dont talk type accident self driving car could get reason human wouldnt like tesla crashing parked truck subtracted non moving object model world kind lack balance suspicious video sponsored
derek said think people think average driver almost every one average number leg think
driverless car already watch let go steering wheel allows car fall cliff
soon wont even steering wheel anything
car arent using mile driven learn like human false equivalence
yep plus simulate lot variation incident order learn google run simulation x
byrnemeister human learn hypothesize model thing work amount training get part learning human example behavior pulling emergency vehicle learned behavior happens infrequently trained reading road sign interpreting thats programed important stuff requires programmer develop wheres program unexpected condition nowhere
aussieexpat well hypothesising try simulation right key issue million upon million edge case google trying fix driving car million mile road tesla trying fix monitoring driving every tesla owner using training data ai pro con edge case holding technology back edge case car stop wont move well google case remote control depot great chandler edge case small number new york london much
byrnemeister im sure million unnoticed edge case day every edge case kill someone wont prioritized driving isnt normal condition abnormal stuff honestly think wont get safe self driving made advancement general intelligence worked likely decade away
example training real world million mile probably never saw bicycle fall front million observed encounter never see bike fall considers extremely rare event prediction worth making statistically however human know consequence falling driving close death fat tail risk high generally drive around bicycle way would still safe even fall machine trained real data likely never prioritize prediction
said beginning work well developed area there way hell car would last even minute
technology waymo us doa hope tesla fsd reach level soon
sure bear mind better average human bottom line use define work doesnt work human drive dont work selfdriving car standard even poorly maintained road still perfect degree vision distance tracking everyone everything around plus direct constant communication gps system map im honestly curious well would perform extremely poor road condition guess id suspect itd behave somewhat like supercautious tentative student driver first learning rope slow halting maybe bit twitchy certainly sort driver youd want road large number likely still better human driver already deal
car better driver anyone yes would work would way safer whatever going
way hell would would probably pull side road give im willing bet road bad driver totally wreckless overtaking oncoming traffic biggest problem life get played narrow road car heading full throttle dozen motorbike zig zagging around people entering road without looking norm road marking illegally parked truck side already narrow road reducing traffic take turn passing car accident minute issue take computer court best case scenario car stay parked one spot cant move
daviddefortier everything said sound dangerous human driver way safer self driving car
ironic
thats bus tho
human cant drive many people dont much pay attention thing environment detail dont even know set three mirror fabled blind spot smart phone might well glue hand
love adding portfolio transportation think ultimate solution reduce necessity car first place view additional piece puzzle like making combustion engine better environment simultaneously trying reduce number
there car seat back baby trust
poll
always thought crazy people thought human reliable wonder obsession ethic selfdriving car like dont take vaccine there still adverse side effect better solution scrutinized existing solution isnt incremental improvement better waiting perfect solution wheres ethic human driving car perhaps put hold wait ethical way human drive car
happens collected data camera radar car driving cctvs
would like point depends road lane marking traffic others following rule coming india road reliable autonomous driving im absolute sure would case year
hard truth india
superpower oh wait
car make connection remote function private would maintenance cost like
google sponsorship youre directly supporting evil company cool
elevator really simple automate car waaaay complicated autopilot aircraft completely different anything required car even airliner fully autonomous still need someone cockpit push right button right time btw overhead panel
seems like driving speed could increase number driverless car increase commuting would faster
road would redesigned there yt video floating around need better job separating major road local street latter pedestrian cyclist currently lot stroads major arterial road driveway car park entry pedestrian crossing etc
id really like derek anyone else try revisit topic cyber security point view autonomous car always connected web correct im wrong
finally people watch video driving
question happens whole bunch car place radar lidar sensor get confusedhave error
interesting technical question
question percentage human better people assume better average driver determine acceptance system
first thought beginning video uploaded video survived
thing im really interested since one respect limit car stay speed limit follows flow
think speed limit flow would safer
car lidar radar afford idea reduce percentage people owning car nothing happy
think people worry liability car kill someone driving little guy liable giant corporation lawyer
car precaution possible disability like punctured tyre problem engine might cause problem certain situation would significant curious
simply dont data prove car safer
hurray jobless taxi driver
another issue privacy car industry know every area going next let look using autonomous vehicle
probably would interesting video sponsored selfdriving car company
vehicle handle indian road hold road
next step safety human prevent accident
alphabet inc employee riding alphabet inc car interesting
buying driverless car
boring
bring northern state try arent ready
get accident car lidar camera outside always going fault
still need bunch people track car
really one team making sure schedule check case someone need something car third team presumably deal possible bug malfunction
car hit guy helmet wrong lane begin
elevator operator driver self driving car mandatory people bad driver
goodbye taxi driver driving vehicle hello completely autonomous world thing dont shut cov
ethical argument thing find funny human would time decision yet get hot bothered computer would
well lawyer liability law always make thing le fun ask
mrsafer word funny meaning hilarious able choose person youre going hit kill never funny sense option stink situation
think people lawyer jury would likely excuse human acting moment impossible situation whereas computer would seen considered option deliberately chosen hit one person extension would also likely try blame whatever human programmed computer
ethic liability priority thought experiment derek straw manning literal argument self driving car
toss coin hit random person done
already trust safety tesla us camera lidar whenever camera blinded sun visibility issue general
feel like fact see steering wheel moving would help give sense youre totally alone car operation hidden view think youd feel much control
walk vehicle
car driverless sitting parking lot
news there thing called weather event
giving competence comfort power life big tech yay
selfdriving aspect ok rider tracked video monitored third party untrustworthy usual bit technology foisted upon mass guise convenience another method creating dependence taking freedom tracking activity fact car monitored someone driver mean device autonomy expense autonomy
excited driverless car concern idiot driver making unpredictable move
hopefully city start allow driverless car also lock human driven car
idiot driver forcing split second decision already problem whats trouble computer process data order magnitude faster human thing confront danger
tesla laughing head outdated approach fsd
bang go uber job
disputing driverless driver safer one thing would miss though car act driving car absolutely love driving car giving autonomous entity would defeat pretty much enjoyment get driving
came happily see teslarip
take home drunk as without guilty duo
imagine hacking car playing siren sound speaker lol
would illegal would confuse human driver well imagine hacking car throwing spike road imagine imagine hacking car painting road line going rock wall fake tunnel wall imagine meep meep
thought thing
ecfeab might illegal could happen
ecfeab acme
nathannorris course could human driver would react similarly someone whats point
cost nly many hundred time cost normal human driver
sponsored opinion paroting cringe thee
john stossel released autonomous vehicle video today also
safe driverless car dont know probably safer hodgepodge floridian driving route west palm beach miami bless heart mix retired driver mph left lane left blinker modified honda civics getting impatient continuously changing lane without signaling course even compared packed route njthe mile highway lincoln tunnel fl route death race ive traveled across usa never seen accident regular basis major highway florida step like nj pas drive right pas left law
experienced recently every lane going every speed ive never much swerving life
people drove slow left lane worse
concern lidar happens car lidar mess car lidar
lol cad automated customer service isnt thats weirdest thing
cool one made doesnt record track everything go
taxi get tracked never lol taxi personal vehicle
car never safe rely premade information waymo us premapped data compared tesla neural network processing data spot waymo give instantly enters new situation
self driving car still car part car great humanity
got spooked guy cart
lot highway u line arent visible due wear wonder drive yet
road mapped hundred thousand time let autonomous vehicle drive autonomously
obviously even watch video seem reliant line people
glad see taiwan mess ignorant ppl
wait till get cyberpunk autonomous car emotional problem lol
video make people trust love driverless car
wow need progress big strike taxi app driver
know get selfdriving car hacking harm fun hey let build transit expensive lol
cant wait become normal partner legally blind never able drive standard car driverless car take anywhere safely would lifechanging miracle
lidar crutch anyone realying lidar dommed elon musk
one question footage derek autonomous car thumbnail photoshopped image front stock image car
cant actually sit passenger seat waymo perspective show there driver passenger
think thats wanted make thumbnail intuitive clickable
asking real question
aint driver fault thats idiot better visibility stop faster deciding paying attention going walking behind moving vheicle unless kid driver driver fault default stupid kid teaching well enough
sponsored waymo commercial would recommend watch jjricks studio youtube channel true current state waymo current state waymo joy ride
cant wait add street racing tomfoolery update
bet driverless car commercially viable there going conspiracy theory
already town area attack driverless car sight wait crazy ready action
cant dodge moral dilemma self driving car picking pedestrian
least year response come fromall place thing arent perfectly mapped inclement weather norm car drive cabin winterdrivers still needed
driver wouldnt able make seen country handle snow rain say car fly still need driver
vehicle billion storm simulation lol
computer able deal traction issue slide braking issue ab turn combined le fraction second live buffalo ny youd think people drive well snow absolutely chaotic thing human control variable
quantumread traction issue selfdriving car currently work reading road sign marking tell road everything covered snow happens situation usually test data simulation
bovineprogrammer ok people cant either idea many accident happen condition describing dont better sens computer also know easy would put sensor road car see wouldnt able plane already stop already inevitable happens
someone inside driver seat lol
think really want autonomous vehicle come market think need car either driven human drive autonomously would allow people want drive drive people want driven driven would kind like cruise control car would optional
think people say driverless car future think wont widely available long time due legislation permit stuff
work express road like travelling far distance need time speed kmhr
believe driverless car work great day significant amount traffic automatic achieve dont know live country rough winter season road occasional become like like suggestion road dependibg weather disappear knowledge environment conditons weather critical sometimes need get creative drive
safe way tesla autopilot safer without
think show plenty crash selfdriving car involved know whats really safe transit rail there money actually solving problem
ugly stupid car drive car drive driven
waiting flying car
select phoenix hot asf there le people abouttraffic
dude need dress like adult video
im curious whats going happen taxi industry fully autonomous vehicle ubiquitous theyre fringe job like elevator driver massive industry give lot people way get started workforce moving america city etc
still level though ots yet
brisbane still elevator operator mid
still elevator driver courthouse building awesome
derek get anxiety thinking outdating existence futurist propose speculate pushing humanity increasingly automated world check documentary terminator judgment day
car could really become something would used daily life
saw another channel
thats insightful
sebastian indeed box thinking
oh really knew verified commentor
oh smart comment
safer experimental gene therapy
derek dark lord muller show u modern day magic
see b roll austin tx comment im simple man
oh hey
okay comment veritasium
wow sam wendover really quiet back
find kind funny people think argument like car accident argument selfdriving car argument car train
im always wondering vehicle lidar would interfere vehicle certain laser wavelength
car lidothese future tesla using vision neural net technology way front
ill trust autonomous car work night heavy rain unknown location driver
said video handle night issue others worked
night lidar based autonomous vehicle already better human laser dont care darkness rain rely camera lot error prone lead accident like tesla hitting truck identified sky waymo operates rainy snowy city think fine
trust right cool good talk situation mentioned absolutely awful human
ready hit moment
shouldnt happened
get trending
would buy autonomous car derek
never get driverless car driving fun
bring say imagine even adapted street autonomous electric transport hell yah utopia let go
steering wheel autonomous vehicle im confused could someone tell
redundency something go wrong software backup plus think maybe insurance may require
think starting point existing car modified autonomous reason easier leave steering wheel
thefulcrum joke think thank lord intellectual
jodidk chief
tldr every year car kill people covid total
witchcraft evil begone
soon derek said video sponsored waymo george hotz came mind
proof autopilot wtf derek cash dont care
india whats time place
lift specifically limited route option aircraft landing benefit given exclusive use runway car journey many time complicated sharing road unpredictable driver bad idea except utopian builtfor driverless car environment even im passenger car rare im always looking road like im driving reversing parking space uk illegal ignored reverse road drive car make transportation cheaper car clearly vastly expensive even premium family car need lot infrastructure staff company want make profit
remember also fully autonomous sniper rifle use face recognition assassinate victim like nuclear scientist iran
total recall flashbackshi im johnny cab take today xd
honestly id love see world full driverless car dont know street become like happens maybe well able pack car closer together road autonomous much quicker reaction time maybe finally allow u put regular bike lane street
news need transit selfdriving car capitalism always know allocate capital make life better lol maybe capitalism know make capital kill rest u wheres democracy vote impotent leader anything actually affect life decided oligarch freedom democracy lol
american comprehend fact car arent form transport
driverless car poll trash answer limited
thats perfectly fine question would consider youself median
elaborate think town good driver one mind bogglingly terrible driver one driver alone would reduce avarage extent every driver would least slightly avarage town driver could rightfully assert better avarage yes think derek
eliyasne yeah people get wrong lot
eliyasne law large number state sufficiently large dataset inevitably approach normal distribution basically start including people statistic getting le le likely median mean significantly different possible town driver unlikely city driver nigh impossible state driver etc
thejudge dont think applies there crucial difference avarage median median driver always driver regardless score driver long preserve hierarchy assuming number drover odd whereas driver happened avarage score definitely dependent example rating shstem rate moderate good driver overly favorably get situation driver get score bottom get score avarging overall avarage score would le median score would scenario irrespective number driver least driver genuinely better avarage
thejudge law large number state average result obtained large number trial close expected value tend become closer expected value trial performed doesnt mean tends normal distribution expected value sum outcome multiplied probability
problem computer better human problem always make sure human behind wheel good case computer u replicate better
weaker script usual derek
next there gon na killer version driverless car like move car
still going le deadly many human driver
there new scenario preparation modern version melting car lucy
waymo deffensive driver
u want efficient try indian road pas drive safe world
need face mask adjust autonomously lady
long covid done soon enough
replace taxi uber eventually privatelyowned car necessary specific activity related work recreation imagine world office home dont need parking lot garage every vehicle wifi get back time spent paying attention road huge real estate ramification well parking lotsgarages prime location sold developed plus safer faster standard major u city within next year
imagine car hit someone freaky car say path cleared
problem selfdriving car extension carcentric mentality building city infrastructure order make never need car comfortably easily navigate town city adam something videoresponse cgp grey video selfdriving car tore apart frame mind overlook pedestrian issue carbon emission
derek find driver elevator today youd wonder rich indian building hold watchman
hit like button video even loaded
future driving car would probably become enthusiast thing
likely manual driving car would seen criminal dystopian future every move action monitored judged government something dont like hijack driverless vehicle send nearest reeducation facility nonchalantly dumped turned puppy chow danger status quo
eh fully autonomous car make sense situation probably norm someday driving isnt way get point b many people
application engineer also private pilot said something made lot sense said commercial pilot arent cockpit fly plane cockpit land plane something go wrong airplane dont fail gracefully lot reason autonomous vehicle autopilot commercial aircraft isnt great comparison inability stop mechanical failure pretty good one anyone worked artificial intelligence tell computer really good solving known problem quickly terrible navigating ambiguity like dealing combination independent system failure engineer didnt think possible car elevator would annoying probably life threatening ft thats bad day
life country need eye hope get accident hah
propoganda guy would heart benefitted technology
kind hack alert people take sort scenario
take note tesla self driving done
couple street thanks
johnvonludd lidar crappy megapixel camera thanks btw tesla robotaxi waiting
damn he old
ok thats amazing would really love drivable road indian
spot ha ha another indian
share pain indonesian chipping
well thats irony dont think human driver one responsible reckless driving
self driving car need level automation drive indian road
hope get better fellow indian
derek wanting leave car mood
public transport
ride progress make unfortunate acronym
doubt thats coincidence
""
imagine website booking ride car rip car rip car available car rip
let rip peace
""
never knew waymo google company looking logo obvious
least driver wearing seatbelt
im terrified theyre gon na economy many men truck driver let alone driving related job number potential job lost million
thats called progress
worse imagine ai complex task like driving well driver manufacturing job service job line cook cashier essentially nonmanagement nonengineer job even teacher construction worker need ready arent needed production anymore robot work u part economy starve unless major change happen world
ive saying year
probably yes new job going exist mass disaster come new job employ different people course implies different requirement exist truckdrivers need find another job unfortunately
funclechuck eventually people wont job universal basic income computerized slave work human relax whatever make u happy
people sitting office driverswhat point
driverless car around decade theyre called taxi james may
eh hate dealing driver paying much ride also schedule
tested winter road
press stop button car dash behind
got ta leave comment get famous asap
technology automation isnt always good thing one case
watch video
get feeling self driving level legal classification qualitative one
think technology kind thats problem order functional need close perfect stage need make affordable tech average person isnt shiny new stuff lab shiny new stuff lab year ago really hope come regular street soon wont holding breath
id still prefer drive car cant easily hacked
lol super scared try driverless car disadvantage car many people lose job driverless car take place future machine take place human use machine till limit
car move upto mile hour car get negative review
actually interesting idea technology actually level im super excited see lifetime car drive around perhaps also lead people owning le car maybe like uber car come pick drive somewhere interesting see
right time
safer driver know know
cabal dont want u driving fact cabal dont want u breathing say take vaccine help cabal
trusting driverless car good definitely better accident trust
waymo university havent seen anyone use
driverless car also wearing seatbelt amazing time alive
hello today
derek doesnt hear ding ding ding ding whole ride guess
sure autonomous car predict meatbag driven car sometimes hard evade accident caused another vehicle
hold paper
tgmtf get ready squeeze paper
theyre safer human driver want kitt asap
kitt would sooo cool sweet jump
dont like sponsored video use cherry picked route time day odd reason always occur beautiful sunny day element truth would interesting know limitation current system far even moderately successful autonomous driving
trust one dont know exactly work dont trust applied statistic hack seem intelligent enough order entrust system life
driving safely isnt crashing everything perfect
average driver
fully autonomous vehicle favs
shitty future
firefly cancelled ride
yes ability thanks
yes exist called tesla
gta look realistic
driverless car better driver car best reduce car travel mostly reclaim city scourge wide road massive parking lot many time bigger store service excessive noise pollution
wait isnt elevator two dimensional motion
using meaning locked one axis
cool veritasium cant make analysis subject whilst sponsorship within subject way ever able take scientific video
jeez
also scientific video tech showcase
comparing autopilot plane selfdriving car like comparing grape melon car entire road road equipped transponder sending reference point car would comparable
new veritasium video already love
well taxi driver nice lasted
though
def
even tho technology legislation around take long time
driverless car airplay work
human different standing computer
interesting see win selfdriving race tesla massive lead thanks five year reallife product testing waymo sensor better performance rain unmarked road waymo hasnt even launched product yet advantage tesla
think theyre aiming different market tesla consumer car company waymo already launched ridehailing service phoenix theyre looking sell car help people get around
waymo strictly selfdriving vehicle company tesla id say huge advantage
waymo already launched seems service real thing already
think waymo designed robotaxi fleet tesla individual tesla driving sensor slowly eliminating believe everything important derived regular camera data train camera give output sensor would
wont race one winner competitor likely get slice pie tesla going rout apple everything self waymo going android rout make software base system existing car company build actual car others able work somewhere
car enthusiast scary sad regs thing feel born late lmao
hate heart need le tech like
waymo car suitable anything tech demo rely premade scanning data surroundings basically engineered fit road theyre allowed drive hardcoded work nowhere else look cool totally useless
imagine car start drift
really isnt news understand youre pushing video people company done waymo waymo google money claim first best whatever
wondering handle parkinglot
stuck traffic suck
car learns rickroll take rick astleys house
house always result traffic jam
ducpham yea lol
nothing relies others safe
future dont need flying car change mind
flying still useful thats helis better option car urgent task sick person changing hispitals searching way make tech already cheaper like personal autopilot heli way better trying make car frame fly
zero interest self driving car
looking forward fsd working
dont get stuck ship container like jaredsilicon valley
challenge system driver plane dont deal landing think improve much human driving
exactly dont ever see happening large scale crappy road badly maintained road marker idiot driver human simply better anticipating ton problem yet solved car lot everything human wont get inside one car isnt going kill road another driver car autonomous road top condition could work isnt case never
wouldnt problem car driverless problem driver cant effect situation whether driving computer
holokyttaja guess system get good show significantly safer human may legislation outlaw human driving would considered risky
leutnantjoker lot money betting one
believe average people lazy technology ever standard car people turn use plus point think video making even driver personally safer autonomous vehicle since even expert driver deal crazy driver impossible accident addition accident computer driver never
bad there somebody monitoring car remotely entire time
ye cab sex
""
good thing people dont small device could fit pocket allow someone track every location phew dodged bullet
somedude really autonomous
juangalt
youtubers always go hair hand take matter dude gal super weird narcissistic
natural habit many people non youtubers style give something
cant wait automatic auto take predict seriously useful hope software use really secure hard hack though
dont know
driverless car still havent even proven drive body mind say soul still speculation
somebody voted year dont doubt driverless work flawlessly good condition bad condition interaction driver cyclist pedestrian busy neighbourhood make sceptic fact insurance company need board one also lot old european city grew long period time thus pretty windy road gridlike like many u city
think regulation necessary standardized safety test ensure enforce selfdriving system safe enough company dont try cut corner
waymo isnt true general purpose ai doesnt represent field mapped sandbox kind bad choice video one tesla fsd would way go
hey mapped sandbox mean
going say waymo mapped almost every inch area high resolution
cmi go already known road cant go anywhere
well probably video waymo sponsored
cmi google map taking picture map google map physical area car follows along premapped area like toy train rail advanced doesnt allow system adapt learn never true self driving algorithm like
wouldnt better car possible anyways
youll get ton comment saying fully autonomous definition
million year get uk world saw lost euro england suck
want pigeon
please dont like jared silicon valley
someone hate driving im really excited autonomous vehicle plus make lot easier elderly stay mobile longer important
think majority people dont like driving especially daily commute obviously man cant admit still strong suspicion
im never imagine try madness
grammar amazing
look terrifying
automationisation lead le human requirement thus lead unemployment
yes menial job go people naturally go science creative side thats actually good thing people become smarter creative
drbright yes true
good basic income
car road driverless wed rarely ever accident somehow dangerous normal car arent
agree big question left answer accident inevitably accident happen hold accountable car company software developer driverless car make liable hard nail
ericbaker handle way handle air crash investigation find whoevers whatever primarily fault ass consequence implement measure make sure doesnt happen
mahadaalvi good point think frequency ground transportation accident happen would issue speedy investigation resolution needed effective feel like airworthy accident happen much le frequently due sheer car road number case investigate might many handle effectively thought ground transportation investigation would much le complex assume may easier manage case
ericbaker extremely limited amount air crash nowadays still due human error total amount incident together drastically decrease since car road youre right naturally obviously car crash year compared airline peak operating efficiency yes ground transportation accident potentially multiple witness multiple cameraother vital data vehicle involved traffic camera data etc youd lucky find metal flap wing plane crash large open body water weve still managed drastically decrease amount accident sky
mahadaalvi good point exciting future sure come without hiccup new technology
dont trust people put makeup car youre weird eww
feel like personal bus take public transport every day school back home feel like personal bus point cant change mind
weve technology fully automated train system without advanced ai year nah everyone obsessed car dependency deal mention kinda go car culture since well dont even damn car literally ride sharing
hahaha personal bus great name
weird take bus driven human youre thinking uber taxi
weve le level autonomy since driving car limited condition relying human cover dangerous edge case easy developing actual full autonomy everything average driver without needing bail ie handing control refusing drive
sir please make video topic superconductors electromagnetic wave hole theory special relativity
th comment
long dont get irobot besides rush hour traffic ultimately like drive
finally cab dont awkwardly worry im supposed talk cab driver
tell go long way round
guinness map integrated suggest change route
stoutproper tell system looking video could speak car like speak alexa hey google could use touch screen use map tell would like drive possible like could already google map added bonus system know certain road congested broken could suggest alternative
william manning anybody sitting next probably someone know wont sit automatic car stranger
ill still talking robot bro
thats creepy intimidating trusting life machine
safer human driver tho
say medical life support
honestly internet long reading many comment id rather trust machine human lot shitty people
work little area
elon musk want know location
cant see become fully common place lawyer world every fatal crash happens autonomous car charge become headline news result outrage lawyer tripping file lawsuit fact autonomous car le fatal accident human doesnt come discussion
problem isnt better le acidents fatal crash new job always exist dont see point
ryanlcbl point fatal autonomous accident going happen lawyer filing lawsuit car company press sensationalizing let car kill people outrage happened already time kind thing delay law required make autonomous car acceptable press lawyer wont using argument people causing vast majority fatal crash thats interest point
big fan sir love india
plz make video aspect ratio
would nice
fun game singularity come
itll soft takeover much even take notice
asked ai thought kurzweils assertion vinges technological singularity come live constant state future shock quoted sociologist whose name regrettably forgot decade ago pointed nowadays notice change expect anymore people complaining change rapid human keep late th century guess singularity happened long ago
derek weird trusting driverless car also derek hop makeshift cart giant windmill
wait someone bet ten grand isnt really driving
video shouldve titled risking life lol
giant windmill cart norm know
brokenacoustic nah see video driverless car way safer propeller contraption riding video
bbbut technically windmill
first
couldnt design better car thing look like wiener wagon
waymo appear viable large scale
thing worrisome autonomous car paradox situation like train experiment
isnt paradox u
multienergico yep terrifying part even human cant decide driverless car act emotionally rationally
exactly always say
multienergico yeah everyone make different decision different time programmer driverless car get make decision everyone every time eg run helpless baby elderly avoid athletic man prime co useful society term productivity whereas human driver would reflexively never run helpless baby geriatric remember smith robot
stop mean cant stop due break failing
excited see driverless car better
shouldnt driverful car driver come prepackaged
veritasium video sponsored waymo elon musk took personally
nah wouldnt care
care probably watch veritasium
mdf sure
miranox dont think people care care
mdf doesnt time lol
st comment post tell mindless comment already love video either way
sue car manufacturer im accident
automation fault yeah probably
legit legal question win
probably high digit lowmid digit sum dollar hire lawyer find really good one wholl take fee win
bunch people get killed would expect class action suit manufacturer happened likely government give manufacturer liability protection
convincing video since sponsored waymo google owns youtube understand tesla even mentioned strange lidar absent looked upon tesla big deal
im watching driverless bed
scared bit
went early
would hard robot worse human driving
worse attentive driver much better minority cant drive ruthless distracted
minute releasing video
would feel petrified first time im passenger one although lot faith software developer made
software developer big tech company id say trust misplaced
aussieexpat beautiful watch sorry topic
ever heard mcas boeing lot faith software developer made passenger lot faith boeing horribly misplaced
stoutproper there lot fewer thing run equivalent test
mdf ha thanks man explorer favorite
let see find solution trolley problem
uploaded hd already youtube getting better
cyberpunk starting look like parody real life rather sci fi
originally supposed point
called predictive programming
boundlessdrop huh
boundlessdrop wut
retrofuturism cyberpunk genre stuck view future would look like
second view like
wow feel like live future many scientist could imagine crazy
mould effect xd
experience driver car
tesla trash
perfect better distracted human
yup like hahahha
probably better nondistracted human
thats whole point really
nope tends perfection tho
yesterday sitting passenger side truck like even minute went road there guy car texting driving talking one saw phone ear
