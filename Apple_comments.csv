People say it will take 10+ years because it is much easier for AI to be accurate and precise in good conditions, but extremely difficult to train it for unexpected or atypical conditions. That is why things like image interpreters can be really good for objects with large data sets but still completely misread situations a human would understand easily (ex. apple and pen separately are fine, but sticking an apple full of pens can be confusing). One could argue that this technology could improve at an accelerated rate due to advancements in technique and processing power, but I would argue there is a limit to modern-day styles of machine learning that result in heavily decreased returns as it approaches such a high level of intelligence, even for companies specializing in it, like Google/Alphabet.
