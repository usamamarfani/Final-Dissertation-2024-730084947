*today:* _look at all those silly autonomous cars! they can only drive as well as a human 99% of the time, and sometimes they stop for no apparent reason. how hilarious._

3.  technology requires good design, construction, and regular maintenance.  the more advanced the

      find qualified technicians to work on these vehicles.  what will it be like with millions of self-driving
     cars on the road.
5.  these test vehicles are not representative of the production vehicles of the future.  corporations will take dangerous shortcuts and use substandard parts to minimize costs and maximize profits.  how reliable will be that technology?
6.  it would appear that the data is being manipulated through minimal driver training to achieve the poor human driver results.  would you want to have an operation from a doctor with the same level of training?

that, is what i don't want. i get that it's ""better,"" but what your elevator segment doesn't account for that is true with cars is that i actually enjoy driving a car. driving, is fun to me and to many other people. not because we think we do it better, i know a computer does it better, but i find it enjoyable. however, the future of these autonomous cars will be that i won't even need to own one. uber will be the future. that makes me sad =(

and, i can see maybe that's ok. and that maybe i'll still own a jeep, and i'll be able to summon autonomous trailer car to pick me and my jeep up to take me to a trail head i can go on. but i hate that idea too. it's making my recreation more cumbersome.

i don't look forward to this. i enjoy my freedom to roam through the mountains and explore places without an autonomous car.

1. benefit for a very small array of very big companies.
developing driverless cars is a technical and most of all a remakable it challenge.
only a small group of very big companies are going for it, we see that the challenge is so great that even some already big companies team up for this development.
the manpower and burnt funds for the development are massive.
the very few companies coming through with a safe driverless solution expect of course accordingly extraordinary profilts and return on their investment.

2. who will be able to use a driverless car in the forseeable future? 
driverless cars will, given a successful development, operate in areas with high population density and clients who are prepared to pay the extra buck for this.
the vast majority of the polulation in a few ""rich"" countries won't be able to use driverless cars, not to mention the rest of the world.

3. who is losing out?
basically there is no difference between a uber car , a taxi, or a driverless car. you book the lift,  pick up , and something brings you to a certain destination.
but the driver job feeds a lot of people, as a full time or part time driver. these guys work hard and pay taxes (as we know that this is not so certain for the biggest companies). 
the dream of the driverless car developers is of course to replace all other individual transport services.
in polarized societies it is already difficult for ""less qualified"" people to find work, this is the wrong direction! no society needs more unskilled workers. 
another burden for taxpayers? or more people on the streets?

4. reasonable investment for future generations?
in times of increasing extreme climate events, droughts, other man-made desasters, still huge areas without proper education,  and many more problems, 
it would have been wiser to use the billions of dollars already burnt for driverless car development for education, environment and sustainable energy research and deployment instead.

only the tech hype ""cool what this can!"" does not justify mindless wase of money in gigantic proportions for show, shareholder value, and some possible benefits for a small group of ""cool"" people in ""cool"" places.

i undersatand that it is important for professional youtube content producers to monetize their work. 
this video is but such a cheap, biased and unreflected work and does not fit to the often mentioned high journalistic standards of this channel.
needed some cash? no problem, mate, waymo lines your pockets.

the clip you showed of someone arguing an edge case where it encourages people not to wear helmets is not invalidated by its rareness. people don't act based on statistics. if they did, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in right now in 2021. we don't need to stop pushing autonomous vehicles forward for this helmet question (the system is nowhere near capable enough of accurately identifying safety equipment and making decisions based on it so it's not a relevant question) but other questions do need to be addressed.

let me give you a perspective that is a bit more worrying to me. twice in the past few months we've seen a huge swath of the internet go offline for a few hours when a major cloud host went down. first google, then amazon. it's been a wakeup call to some that we've overcentralized our online infrastructure, but others are ignoring it...because of course they are. just last week we had a zero day where all apache servers (the most common web server software). the concern with automated driving is it potentially creates a very deadly single point of failure. i don't see that happening with waymo's current fleet as they are largely autonomous and, importantly, nowhere near the most common vehicle on the road. but let's fast forward to when an automated system controlling vehicles is as common as toyota vehicles. there are three major issues that need to be clearly addressed before many of us will trust allowing them to grow towards that point.
1. does it stop working if some external service goes offline - gps, internet, a server in toyota's basement, whatever. obviously, given a certain country it's being developed in, it can currently stand to be without internet for a while because american internet, but we can't get ourselves dependent on a transportation technology that stops functioning entirely if an online service goes down. a smartbulb that won't work anymore because the server discontinued is a small inconvenience, but if ford goes under and shuts off servers their vehicles depend on, that can result in a lot of slow and painful deaths. 
2. can the fleet be compromised. the talk of cars that communicate with each other sounds great...unless you work in computing. then it sounds like someone forgot bad people exist. that sort of inter-connectivity is like handing the nuclear codes to anyone who figures out or is told how to send commands to those cars. if someone figured out how to send the command to accelerate over that communications system (which, even if the communications system doesn't convey commands is still possible) then millions could die within hours.
3. can individual cars be attacked. for a while, many banks and credit card companies were putting wireless chips in cards and insisting it was ""safe"". security experts demonstrated a small loop of wire that could fit in someone's pocket, along with a small control device could pull all the needed information off the cards from a distance and reproduce it on demand. now those chips aren't in most cards anymore. a few manufacturers are desperately claiming theirs are ""safe"" but few are gullible enough to believe them now. this one is going to have to be demonstrated, not merely assured. something like letting a few hacker conventions have at the vehicle on a closed course where they won't have any qualms about making it do things that would otherwise be lethal. this one is more for avoiding unnecessary roadblocks. we don't want car manufacturers to get gunshy about automated software like banks did with the card chips. yes, you can get people to quickly trust the car to drive, but it can just as quickly generate distrust and outrage if one person gets killed because a malicious individual tricked the vehicle into doing something wrong. you would also need to test against large scale shutdown attacks such as saturating an area with the right frequency of light that the lidar is using or painting something with a material that scatters or absorbs that light.

saving lives is a good goal, but if you leave the door open to losing more lives, or if you rush forward so fast that you stumble and slow down the process, then you've done a disservice. being better than what we have now isn't good enough. we have to work through the ramifications of it to avoid unintended consequences.

many years ago, people worked out that putting lead in gasoline would solve a major problem. and an entire generation got lead poisoning from that. unintended consequences can be disastrous beyond your wildest dreams, especially for something as ubiquitous as transportation. we need this technology to succeed, not be held back by early failures that could have been anticipated if we had listened to the people we thought were just naysayers.",16,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.9842}",negative

1) there's a big difference between self-landing aircraft and self-driving cars.   planes are tightly controlled, tightly regulated, thoroughly maintained and kept under secure conditions (generally).   the same is true of the airports.   the runway, weather conditions, optimal glide slope, height of surrounding terrain etc are all known quantities, and the pilots should be warned ahead of time in case of any exceptions or technical faults.   runways are regularly patrolled and aircraft are inspected before each and every flight.  nobody is going to walk onto a runway with a paint roller and draw some new markings on and divert the aircraft to a new location.   a massive unexpected pothole should not appear without someone noticing.   the pilot would have dozens of miles of advanced warning in case ils is not functional.   nobody should be able to smear some grease onto a camera lens or cut a cable while the plane is stopped in traffic and render the landing systems inoperative.  finally, except for the final few seconds before touchdown, a landing takes place over many minutes and miles, and there is a large period of time to detect misalignment or deal with checklists, and go-around if something is wrong.   a pedestrian steps out from behind a parked car?   you've had a split-second to deal with that.

2) how does the car respond to a technical or mechanical fault?   i'm sure it can be easily programmed to deal with faulty sensors/cameras, but what happens when it detects a slight pull to the left, the brakes start to fade down a long hill, or the engine loses power right before pulling out of a junction?   it could easily be programmed to respond to sub-par performance and limp to safety, but i imagine it'll be some years before the car ""making a funny noise"" is easily detected.   something as simple as a nail in a tyre could be clearly heard and felt by a human, but would be very difficult for software to reliably detect.

3) where does the burden of responsibility lie, if the vehicle has no driver?   a man drives a car into a pedestrian and kills them, because they sneezed and closed their eyes.    one person potentially to blame, one person to prosecute, one person to punish or feel the guilt.    what happens when the car fails to correctly anticipate a situation, or a software update with an unforeseen bug gets pushed out and all of a sudden thousands of cars suddenly stop detecting pedestrians on crossings correctly and you have 500 fatalities in one day.   do you chalk that up to experience, or charge the ""negligent"" programmer with 500 manslaughters?

in a world where cars are driverless, you could argue that any and all accidents not caused by road conditions are therefore the programmers responsibility.   then you have a situation where it's nearly impossible for them to exist with a perfect safety record, as they will inevitably make some mistakes or not predict some outcomes, so the developers will have to decide whether they can deal with having a few deaths on their conscience, because the statistics suggest it's likely more people would have died if they'd been driving themselves.

4) what happens in an accident if the car is driving empty?   it doesn't full on smash into someone but maybe its action causes another car to crash into someone else, or it clips a child, not enough to cause a loud impact that would class as a noticeable g-force, but it makes a thump any human would know to investigate and would see an injured toddler.    the car doesn't know the difference between that and catching a stray branch or a pothole, does it carry on to its next destination leaving the child in the street or the crashed cars to fend for themselves?   essentially automated hit and run.

in summary:  in public transit systems like air, rail, and sea, there is so few obstacles and variables and they are typically travelling via well maintained and well regulated and inspected routes and vehicles.   issues should be detected before they cause fatalities and all the routes they are travelling on are known and controlled.   the open road is far too variable to account for all possibilities in advance, unless this is restricted to purely and simply well maintained cities and highways, with clear road markings and known routes.   even then, it's not perfect.   so do we settle for on average fewer people dying, but some people will die needlessly?   i'm not suggesting we never have driverless cars, but they need to be at the level where they are so rigorously tested and tightly controlled and regulated with equally tightly controlled and regulated roads and highways that it would take a near perfect society with perfect roads where programmers can predict every possible outcome before it could happen.   in my view, anyway.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.9951}",negative

(rain still seems to be a problem for waymo sensory systems.) a lot of road infrastructure has to be either changed or augmented to accommodate these vehicles. for example traffic regulatory systems (traffic lights, speed signs, etc) need some way of communicating with the vehicle as well as communication between vehicles. also for better or worse a lot of legislation has to be done.

in much environmentalism work, people fail to think about how efforts to be eco-conscious can affect those with disabilities. i'm not saying to throw environmental activism out the window, i'm just saying that people with disabilities need to be considered in conversations about making the world a better place, as very frequently decisions are made without having them at the table.
with that in mind, i've had a very open mind to driverless cars where some may have not (with the hope that they could be as eco-friendly as possible), understanding that public transport has not been as effective at being a handicap-friendly service as pick up and drop off services have (at least, in my city in canada, that's the case).
so i was prepped to really be on board with this video. 
i was expecting to hear pros and cons, and caveats to paired with exciting new considerations from a variety of experts.
i ultimately did not feel like we were got that.

i so want to be able to get around as freely as others-  not being dependent on a person being available to take me somewhere is a big deal. what's bigger however, is knowing that l would be safe, and if there isn't an accurate understanding of where things are at in development, people with disabilities may decide to make use of driverless cars before it's advisable.
it should be fine to tell both sides of the story, because if driverless cars are going to thrive, they're going to have stand up under scrutiny. 
this video only gave voice to the company whose product is being highlighted- it makes sense that they would be inclined to paint a positive picture of their product, but where is the point of view of any external specialists in this field?
that fact there were no alternative points of view examined or external specialists featured, made this feel incredibly biased. i imagine you could have even brought in a specialist who reinforced your position, but even that wasn't done.
to present, seemingly, that there are just no downsides or dangers to driverless cars at this point seems a little premature. the majority of other companies in the space do not seem ready to launch their own driverless cars yet- this seems to indicate that there still must be a lot of fine-tuning that is needed.

please consider that when you paint such a positive picture of something, people may believe it and then act upon it. a person with a disability may not have the proper autonomy to help themselves out if a driverless car acts in error, but if they believe they won't have to, they may decide to be some of the earliest users of this service. this may put some very vulnerable people in a dangerous position.

i wanted to know accurately what kind of hope we have for this type of technology, and it did not feel like i received an unbiased report of that here. it really is a shame, because i love this channel, and i believe that you believe what you have shared here. i just also feel that you may have challenged it more if you didn't have to answer to the sponsors of this video. people tend to look at scientists and science channels as the tellers of truth, and i want to believe that that is the case more often than not.

it also needs proper testing in varying rain and snow conditions, something testing in this area of arizona doesn't give much of (particularly the snow part.) and even if it understands normal rainy conditions, can it tell that a wet road *with fallen leaves on it* is *way* more slippery than a normal wet/rainy road? trying to brake on a wet road with leaves is like ice, if you've ever had the misfortune to need to stop suddenly under conditions like that.

the idea that you can have individualised transport and this in any way be a good thing (tm) is pure marketing nonsense. 

because if it can't can't cope with winding, narrow, non-grid, poorly marked roads in literally all weather conditions (which it won't ever be able to do) it's not useful in the slightest. consider that in various places as traffic control strategies they remove clear road markings in schemes to help pedestrians and cyclists share the space (drivers go slower when there are no road markings).  

the london underground has the ability, in part, to run driverless. it does on the dlr light rail (runs above ground on viaducts mostly) but the victoria line which has had the option for decades does not have driverless operation, because of safety concerns (from both staff and passengers) should tell you exactly how accepting people are of putting a computer in charge of their lives. 

campaign for more trains in the us, they are driverless (or can be) and much better for the environment and can be driven from grid electricity so avoiding the problems with batteries (which suck on a power/weight basis).

if i get hit by a driver there are laws which will punish the person at fault with fines or jail. if i get hit by an automated car who is responsible? does the company get fined or put in jail for their poor coding? because i want actual ownership of responsibility too. because if no one is responsible that's just asking for trouble. you make an automated car and it hits me. you should go to jail, if laws for this don't exist i don't want driverless cars. 

you are aware that in the uk we just cross roads, don't have to use crossings, we learnt the green cross code as children. or how does it deal with speed humps or pillows, does it know some as really smooth so you don't need to slow down much and some are really severe and you need to go at 5mph over them?

for autoland what ground based equipment is essential for this to happen. you glossed over what exactly 'cat 3' means. because you are not getting any of that on roads any time soon. also where there is basically nothing else to hit (wake turbulence makes it impossible to even get close) is much easier. comparisons to flight are silly if you know how much equipment is required for automated operations, you can't autoland on the sea or in a field.

if images to screw with automated recognition systems exist (and they do) there are so many blind spots in the code that you don't even know about. a few pixels is all it needs to trick systems into seeing or not seeing something. it's not smart, it's actually pretty dumb. 

that sudden stop was at a speed hump not a crossing. the dude with the trolley was not going to cross where there is a speed hump, that is just asking for trouble. 

we should be campaigning for fewer cars, more mass transit, not more individualised transport, which is far less sustainable than mass transit. 

as a cyclist i want cars to move predictably, which for the most part on london roads they do, sure turnings are an issue, but in 14 years of cycling in london i've never been hit. cars stopping because they imagine a crash is very problematic for cyclists, i expect cars to keep up with traffic not randomly stop. stopping can be much worse than continuing, as i'm judging the road ahead and working on the assumption that cars are mostly predictable and in london traffic they mostly are. 

getting rid of the majority of cars and using them for disabled people is only possible with mass transit. more cars is not a solution. 2 tonnes to move 1 person is not smart. 200 tonnes to move 1000 people seems much better. give roads back to people not objects, make cities friendlier to the people who live here not give over everything to the supremacy of the car. individual transport is not the future, it is the past. if you want humans to have a future the world needs more mass transit and fewer cars.",1,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': -0.9612}",negative

the real unspoken solution to this problem is just to redesign the city to have less cars, because cars inherently, and in large numbers, as they are, are going to be lethal, especially with how north american roads are intrinsically designed, with multiple points of conflict, and design elements that are at odds with one another, relative to, say, german design. for example, large, multi lane roads, which is something primarily used for ferrying heavy traffic and amounts of cars, intersecting with smaller roads, via turn lanes, or turnouts, which necessitates frequent lane changes. that creates multiple points of conflict, and is a design that's at odds with itself, it attempts to serve multiple contradictory functions. north american roads often have to be designed this way simply to accommodate the fact that everyone has to have cars. this is a scaling issue, too, you can look at parts of denmark or the netherlands, and they use cars infrequently, compared to, say, urban france, which is better than germany, and then germany is better than north america.",0,UgxF7DR5BQn889sqiqp4AaABAg,True,none,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.9281}",positive

less than a third of the cars on the road are newer than 5 years, and less than 1% of cars are older than 25 years.  that means that if every single new car made were driverless this year, it would take 5 years before a third of the cars were driverless, and 25 years before 99% of cars are driverless.  it is very unlikely every new car will ever be driverless, so this skews even further into the future.  retrofitting older cars to be driverless could work much faster, but because of the vastly different abilities of older cars there would be an enormous amount of errors causing accidents.

driverless cars are a rich persons toy.  at least for the next 3 decades, assuming we start making every single new car driverless.

the reason why we have as many cars as we do today started because germany came up with a way to make cars cheap enough for everyone to have.  then america decided that being able to move a large amount of people and military equipment very quickly on a highway network would greatly increase the ability for the nation to defend itself.  however, that decision was made when there was a draft, any adult male between 18 and 64 would be required to join a war.  now the military doesn't expect everyone in the country to be ready to fight a war.  we have many fewer soldiers and they are specially trained.  we transport them in the air or on enormous boats.  we do not fight wars with hundreds of millions of people anymore.  even if world war iii started tomorrow, it would probably be over before the government decided to enlist every adult male between 18 and 64.  simply put, the original purpose of cars is no longer relevant.  cars are an outdated technology for a problem that no longer exists.  we are not fighting a massive war, and even if we were, we wouldn't be able to rely on the highways.  there would be traffic jams the entire country over and the only chance of the military using the highways would be if they had a giant bulldozer weighing 30 tons that can push people out of the way so they can transport the necessary equipment to where it is needed.  that would never happen.  ever.  it is more likely they would use massive boats going up and down the coast moving things, or thousands of cargo planes, or underground pipelines, or mega-trains.  we don't need cars.

  the question isn't whether or not they should be driverless, it is whether or not we should invent something new to replace them altogether while we still have the resources to do it.  cars are not now, nor ever will be, economically or environmentally sustainable.  every single car is less then 15% efficient at turning fuel into moving a human.  you weigh less than 200 lbs, but your car weighs 3500 lbs.  even if your car were ""%100 efficient"", it is still moving 3,500 lbs of car to move less than 200 lbs of person.  that means that 87.5% of the energy being used by the car is being used just to move itself, and only 12.5% to move you.  the whole concept of cars is too inefficient to take seriously in the 21st century.

  as an example of a system to replace cars.  imagine a remote-controlled shopping cart that weighed 100 lbs and could carry 50 lbs of groceries.  a person has to get a ""remote-control vehicle driver's license"".  a car has to move 3,500 lbs to move 50 lbs of groceries.  that is 70 lbs of car moved for every lb of groceries.  this would move 3 lbs for every lb of groceries.  that is 23 times less energy.  a typical car costs $25,000.  a remote-controlled shopping cart could cost less than $3,000.  you wouldn't even need to own one, you could rent one from the grocery store for $5 a trip.  that is $260 dollars a year for the transportation of groceries, assuming you shop once a week.  compare that to the cost of insurance and fuel that is usually over $1,000 a year.

  this is just one example of how we could replace the car.  there are many like this that would save the environment.  if we are going to be pouring billions of dollars into changing cars, we should at least be doing it in such a way that improves the world.  this delivery shopping cart idea is 20 times as energy efficient as electric cars, and probably 40 times as energy efficient as gas cars.  not only that, it would cost less than switching to self driving cars, and is better at the one thing that self-driving cars can claim.

  the only thing going for self-driving cars is that they are safer, but no matter how safe they drive they can't compete with a vehicle that weighs 20x less than them.  not only that, if everyone used these smart-carts for all their shopping, they wouldn't even be out in a car in the first place.  the number of accidents would plummet, and the number of accidents with people actually in the cars would also plummet.  the number of injuries and death would go so much lower that driverless cars couldn't even compete with it.  not to mention the money lost in accidents would go so low that insurance for these things would be very cheap.  you would no longer need to pay out $35,000 in damages, at worst just $3,000 in damages and $200 for the shopping that was lost.  no hospital visits.  even if a normal car was in an accident with one of these, the chances of them being hurt when their 3,500 lb car hit a 100 lb shopping cart is so low that even the insurance for regular cars would go way, way down.

  we need to think outside the car.  there are way better options.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': -0.9552}",negative

however, we don't have the data of the future, and predictions are becoming more and more unlikely, even with larger numbers, especially with something as volatile as an economy. unemployment rates have fluctuated throughout history due to many factors including technological advancements.
humans are very adaptable, and there is a low chance that a complete overhaul of car automation will happen at once, giving ex-employees of companies that decided to adopt autos the chance to plan. the average age of truck drivers, for example, is around 45-55, with an average retirement age of just over 60. there is a shortage on the rise, actually, for many reasons other than automated vehicles.
i'm not an expert, but i think you should be eased by the fact that everything is unpredictable, and not all people that rely on the driver industry need to worry about it much for at least 5-10 years.
as for prospective employments, i really can't say much. if the cost of driving is lowered for companies due to automation, the profit margins skyrocket. expansion is inevitable and more and more jobs still in need are going to be in demand.
i think you know as you read this how complicated it gets, and you'll soon need to take into factors such as population growth, the matthew principle and other public health issues. 
i agree with your concerns, but we can never be too sure of the impact, less so of the aftermath, and we have no idea what is in store for the future of employment opportunities, not only in the usa, but other countries, especially developing ones, which in my experience have to be very innovative.

however, derek seems too biased towards this. not because of the sponsorship, but him personally. i can see why he's such a big fan, though that makes some of his arguments over-optimistic. yes, elevators and trains have become driverless, but they have limited movement options and traffic. planes have traffic, but most of those are controlled by professional companies who regulate the movement trajectories. cars, on the other hand, are driven by rando people who have no obligation but to themselves. so way more chaotic. a reason why there are more car accidents than plane accidents.

now that would seem to imply that replacing humans with machines should improve safety. if it is a dominant replacement (like over 90%), i would agree. but people are selfish; many of them enjoy the feel of driving themselves and so they'll demand their right to be able to drive cars even if driverless cars are an option. and in many places, the biggest problems for driving is not the environment but the other human drivers. if they all followed the rules like machines, we would be swell. but they don't, sometimes unintentionally.

yes, driverless cars have accumulated more driving experience than any human driver. but that doesn't make them a better driver. because part of driving is predicting how the other drivers will react ... which means you need a mental model of how humans think. that is something which comes free with most humans and allows them to be better drivers despite the much lower experience.",1,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9656}",positive

the neural networks that are trained to analyze the surrounding of the car are still very much biased. they might be trained well for specific suburbs and or highway, but places with different layout and/or surroundings will throw them off. try going on a street through a forest. also, has the car been trained on deer? it might detect there's *something* but if it can't detect what it is, it might react poorer than a human, cause it hasn't been trained for this (and believe me, it almost certainly is not trained for this).

besides, often the data used to train these neural networks have bias against people of color or disabled people. so a wheelchair might be falsely detected as a bench and the car assumes the person is sitting still instead of going over the road. these things are due to how humans select the data for the training and looking into preventing these biases is a topic many companies only start to look into.

and i'm not even going into ""attacks"" on autonomous cars. ever saw the give of a car trapped in a circle of salt cause it things that's a ""do not cross"" lane marking? or the autonomous car driving behind a truck that transports traffic lights and the car detects them as traffic lights installed on the road? edge cases for sure, but human would know how to react, they would recognize that this is nonsense. having an autonomous cars decide these situations are nonsense and ignoring sensor data seems like a bad idea as well tho.

i do absolutely think autonomous cars should become the norm. but being exposed to all the problems they still have if your not in a very specific, almost controlled environment, i don't believe that this future is close yet. though i do hope to be proven wrong! we're working on it ;)",8,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.9693}",negative

now, maybe autonomous cars will allow for highly efficient and easy-to-use car sharing services, which might reduce the number of cars stuck in parking lots and diminish the amount of space take up by cars in our living spaces overall, but i doubt that will have an impact on traffic/trip duration.

it seems in this video that autonomous cars are simply better than humans. but trust me, we have a long way before that really happens.
i'm a engineering student at a french engineering school and right now, i'm working on autonomous vehicles and technologies associated to them.
firstly, the united states and some other countries with recent and well maintained road are easy to take as examples for fully autonomous cars, in europe and other countries with older roads, complex mappings and even nonexistent ""paved surface"", especially on the countryside, it's not that easy.
interstates and city roads are well maintained and pretty simple to ""master"" for autonomous car. you can map areas that are commonly used and take advantage of the well placed and maintained elements or markers on the road in other cases.

secondly, software are able to do what we programmed them to do. it's true that almost all the time, nothing particular will happen. but playing with statistics means that at some point, your system will face something it's not programmed to handle. the problem is what will it do in that case ? will it even be able to recognize something is wrong ? what if the thing it actually tries is even worse and leads to a catastrophic event ? there is no other way for now to handle those cases than simply letting a driving operator take control to solve the issue, if it's even possible to solve the issue before facing the problem at all (to avoid an accident or crash for example).
i've seen a lot of software simply ""give up"" or create a worse situation because they ""didn't knew"" what to do or even worse : did not analyze the situation correctly.

the real future scenario is that autonomous cars and shuttles (for public transportation) will be able to drive fully autonomously in the main axis and cities where the road are well maintained and the ""mapping"" is already done. but having a fully autonomous car and being able to go anywhere with it without limit is not something you can count on in the near future you are talking about.",24,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': -0.82}",negative

(best i can recall is an offhand comment that the roads are well maintained.)

phoenix was chosen for a reason - it has excellent driving weather, the roads aren't too complicated, and the traffic isn't particularly heavy. and, even with all those advantages, i believe that waymo relies on their own exhaustive (cm-scale?) mapping of the entire service area (eg. so the car knows where the road is), and i don't think this approach is particularly scalable.

yes, it's exciting that it can work at all, and it gives me a lot of hope for the future. but i think it's a long way from the eventual goal of driverless cars being safe to use on arbitrary roads.

me, a mechanic who actually enjoys driving: ""i don't trust anything i can't fix. the more computers you cram into an automobile, the easier it is to brick.""

on a completely different note, i love the freedom that comes with an automobile. the freedom to travel and explore on a scale that our ancestors could barely dream of. i don't want to surrender that freedom to a computer, or the tech company that built it.

looking at the modern obsession with safety, it seems to me that, barring a cultural reversal or a catastrophic shakeup in the geopolitical scene, that in thirty years politicians are going to mandate driverless features. it will be like the seatbelt. at first it is optional, then it is mandatory to be installed, and then you get ticketed for not having it installed. that freedom to roam is going to be taken away, locked behind the car's interface.

i am safe enough. i am responsible for what i do on the road, and i am not going to relenquish that responsibility to a computer.

so, no thanks. i'm not buying what you are selling, for reasons you probably never considered.

ps: your sixty million deaths statistic is nonsense. big numbers taken from worldwide populations over long periods of time are meaningless. take the sixty million who have died on the streets, and compare with the number of people who have died from heart failure or disease in the same time span.

-induced demand: the more roads and lanes you build results in an increase in traffic. 
-increase in vehicle dependent suburban sprawl development:
-environment impact of manufacturing combustion and or electric vehicles:

first off i want to make it clear any technology that increases safety and decreases harm is a good thing. that being said i argue av's are not a cure all. ride share services such as uber, lyft, and taxies are great examples to compare av's too. why.. because it is a self driving vehicle (driver) that takes you to point a to point b. what results have urban planners and traffic engineers learned from this technology. driving while intoxicated has decreased, this is a good thing. whats the negative, an increase in traffic and demand for more roads. 


so whats is the goal here? are av's good or bad? av's are only one chapter in the book of safe transportation. the other chapters include engineering safer roads, (the us fails at this, it's honestly embarrassing) netherlands on the other hand does an excellent job with this by building protected bicycle lanes, forcing vehicles to slow down not with speed limit signs but by narrowing streets and adding street trees. when a vehicle accident does happen it is not only the drivers fault but also the infrastructure. ticket the driver and reengineer the road so that type of accident does not happen again, the us does not do this. also building denser communities where a traditional vehicles or av's does not does not make sense when a 15 walk or a 5 minute bike ride is faster.  

i still think av's have a place on our roads. but their overall impact is dwarfed compared basic civil engineering that prioritizes pedestrians and bicyclist and dense urban development (development that is deemed illegal in all 50 states). not to mention the hundreds of electric bicycles you can manufacture out of one electric vehicle. at the end of the day you can not out smart basic geometry.  vehicles are big, people and people on bikes are small.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9518}",positive

besides, humans don't need to be ""trained"" as much for extensive periods of time with huge amounts of data points to be able to cope with unexpected situations, but can react without even being trained before (not always successfull, that's true, but i still think humans outperform autonomous system by far when dealing with situations they haven't been ""trained"" for and have no data available).

also consider the potential impacts this may have in other areas of society. you'd want some means for your car to be able to id passengers so if you send it to pick up your inlaws at the airport, they can get in, but no one else. now your car can id the passenger, it's great for security, someone breaks in, if they're in the dmv database, they can be ided instantly. now, what if you skip out on bond and a warrant is issued for your arrest. we don't need bondsmen or cops, just wait for you to get into any car, and when it id's you, you get locked in and driven straight to the nearest jail, lol. 

when everyone is a passenger, enjoying the passing scenery instead of looking at the road, you may see a concerted effort to beautify roadways. autonomous drive-thrus will be a thing. i imagine mcdonald's reverting to a 1950's style drive-in, where rather than having long lines of cars, vehicles arrive, park around the building, and orders are brought out based on the order availability rather than arrival time, as that would be more efficient. if you have three people who ordered fries, and one guy who didn't, fries aren't up yet, why is the last guy waiting at the back of the line? people care about ""first come, first served"", but that's almost never the most efficient order for the fulfillment of any service. take away the drivers who might get butt-hurt about it, and it's a whole new world of efficiency. 

imagine your car paired with a smart watch that monitors your vitals. for a lot of ambulance calls, the car alone could be sufficient for transport without a medical attendant. maybe every car has an ambulance mode, and if emergency criteria are met, other cars will clear the roadway, perhaps by means of a series of minor detours a mile ahead in anticipation. no need for lights and sirens, a car in an emergency mode gets it's own little bubble of clear road for the whole journey, with every light being properly adjusted ahead of it's approach. 

would you pay more for your car to passively avoid high-crime neighborhoods? many people would. what happens to businesses in those neighborhoods? it's common knowledge that infants sleep better on car rides. how long until parents just stick their crying kids in the car and send them around the block for a few hours unattended. you know it will happen. it'll probably have it's own facebook advocacy group with 2 million people. political protests will get interesting when a million people can send their cars to the capital without going themselves. for that matter, i could send out a mass email about a vehicle warranty recall with an appointment time, and have hundreds of gullible people send their cars to a location of my choosing and ddos a physical city. the possibilities for abuse are profound, but easily countered. but i wonder what ramifications those countermeasures will have.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9806}",positive

yes, aviaiton is highly automated and i think it is likely that we will see a further decrease in pilots required in the future however, the reason why manual landings are the standard, day or night, is simply because they far more efficient in an operational perspective (higher spacing required) and some airports are not even equipped for these approaches and they are in an guaranteed safe area by atc.

regarding the operational perspective, for sustained cat3b ils quality, the minimum seperation between aircraft has to be increased significantly. we are talking doubling, and for airports that rely on visual approaches, like sfo, quadrupling the seperation (if all aircraft were to fly behind each other). and this is not even taking into account problems with big aircraft like the a380 causing disruptions to the signal in its vicinity. 

but what i fear even more is that the autopilot takes over specific jobs that are clear and well defined, a car's autopilot can't do that and we are missing the human aspect of interaction and problem solving. in the case of planes, atc guide them a long their flightplan and around obstacles. driverless cars will have to do that themselves and i fear their behaviour in spaces,where this is required, like tight roads, will cause many issues.

i think we will see a lot of autonomous driving on streets where the quality/intensity of a conflict is not as big, regardless of the quantity, like highways that physically seperate directions. here the question of pulling out of your lane can be solved fairly easily and mathematically, plus you operate in pretty safe space in terms of homogenity of other participants and solving issues single handedly works reasonably good.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9552}",positive

think of like a hierarchy over distance - plane/boat/train -> train -> bus/tube -> car/bicycle -> walk, at longer to shorter distances over a network of routes.  however, short distance drives are far more likely to be situations in which autonomous vehicles work poorly (countryside roads, small villages, woodland, dirt paths, driveways - frequently poorly maintained areas).  so, in an ideal world, where we have focused on economically and ecologically sustainable public transport infrastructure, the use case for autonomous vehicles drops dramatically.  where they may become useful is for local public transport - planes, trains, buses, trams - where we are already investing heavily in automation.

this fascination tech-minded people have with personal autonomous vehicles, to me, seems like a distraction from solutions which could make a real-world impact.  reducing traffic density reduces danger on a completely different level to removing human dependency.  for me, it has always seemed like a smokescreen from big business interests who want to continue selling cars, and moving towards a monopoly ownership of our roads (the natural extension of jaywalking laws in the us, for example).  it's a very cool smokescreen, and it's a very impressive technology, and it makes me say ""wow, humans are so innovative, and creative"".  i think that plenty of incredible individuals are working on these projects, with great moral and personal reasons for doing so.  but it lacks substance in terms of the ratio of effort to net effect that other options provide.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.9689}",positive

examine this closely, watch all aircraft crash investigations recently where human intervention prevented a crash where simple computers were in control and lost their ability to fly because of another computer malfunctioning component.  humans can take over and the will to survive is still stronger for a human than it is for a computer module. a computer can be turned on or off but a human can only be turned off. do you understand that concept? 

a computer because it can be turned off and then back on is not living. at least our concept of living is not available to a computer yet.. it can simply return to it's living or on state at the flick of a button or simply by adding electricity to the right components. not so much in a human. eh ?!?

flying an airplane or driving a car is not like riding in an elevator where all a person does it go up and down. cars and airplanes still have other considerations to consider at least at this moment they do? even the faa recognize that computers may be good at flying and in some circumstances behave better than a human but not in all cases.. computers are fine for many things but people still build computers and people fail and so do computers at this time. in some not too distant future i suspect that computers control of human civilization may occur but just not right now.

it would be ridiculous if a simple task can not be done because the car was not program to handle it.
keep in mind that you give away all your control over the vehicle (except that stop button).

examples:
the car itself will probably never go over the speed limit even if an emergency requires it. (get away of a tornado or someone needs very urgently medical care) if such a feature will exist it will be abused, and there is no way for the vehicle to decide what is, and what is not an emergency with 100% certainty.
the car is and always will be abused and hacked by haters. small example: just imagine someone blasting on bluetooth speakers a siren to stop an entire traffic of those cars. or are you suggesting that the car should not stop at that sound?
what happens when the road is not on the official map that the vehicle uses, or the signs and/or the road is badly drawn, or doesn't make sense because the idiots that designed the road were drunk? i highly doubt that the car understands the enviroment that great. (and even if the producer claims that i wouldn't trust that claim).  there will always be uncharted roads or places that are off-road that you might want to go with a car like in a forest, or a newly built road...

don't get me wrong i'm not against them. i'm just saying that we are probably not ready yet (and i don't mean by safety standards, those are fine).

i would love to see a list of scenarios like this and what are the solutions that fully autonomous vehicles can do in each scenario. or at least how could it be solved in the future if it's not an actual feature yet.
i like to believe i am a good driver, and i don't believe anyone would chose a self driving car unless the worst case scenarios are covered. in general people who think of themselves as good drivers will not be concerned by the safety of their driving, and since over 99% of vehicles currently are not self driving they won't see the point in the change yet.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.102, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': -0.4381}",negative

imo there will be one of the two futures:

1) you own the self driving car
meaning you have to pay for
maintenance
regular upgrades
garage with a charger/visiting fuel station regularly


2) car transport as a service
basically taxi.
monthly fee
mileage fee
cars will be stored in depots around the country and you will always get one with full charge/tank. if trip takes too long you will be asked to swap cars at some depot along the way.

in both scenarios i can't think of what is the advantage over public transport.

here in europe i use car less than 10 times a *year* (only when i need to transport big objects or have to be somewhere at 5am)taking a bus/subway/tram is just way cheaper, i don't have to deal with where to park, public transport vehicles rarely break down as they are regulary maintained...  i started to share my 2007 car with my siblings and a friend as i found it hard to justify paying insurance on something that sits in a garage all year.

in fact most modern cars can prevent those errors using lane assists, blind spot assists, lidar-based autonomous braking systems etc. furthermore, currently, the eu requires a lot of these systems to be added to every production vehicle. these systems have been already proven to be very effective in terms of reducing overall road fatalities. 
thus to properly justify the point of general use of autonomous vehicles we should compare them to the average driver driving a modern car equipped with modern safety features.  not to mention the general cost-effectiveness and convenience. i think that fully autonomous vehicles are really the future but the future of commercial transportation not personal. they will become widespread when the cost of hiring the driver will be higher than maintaining a fully autonomous vehicle.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.3103}",positive

this make come as a surprise to many, apparently, but some of us actually like driving, and if you don't chances are you have a terrible car. a good car doesn't have to be expensive, tones of cheap cars are amazing to drive and that in turn prompts driver engagement and therefore safety.

high intake of carbs and saturated fats are just as deadly if not deadlier than cars, yet tech companies are not pushing for a future without any of those sorts of equally preventable deaths... because people's well being is not the real motivation for driverless cars, nor has it ever been, it's just an excuse: the real motivation behind driverless cars is for businesses to be able to extract more money out of people, namely by:

- getting people to focus their attention off the road and onto a screen, where they can be exposed to targeted ads;
- taking away your daily commute ""me time"", and make it so that you no longer have an excuse not to clock in via zoom/skype/whatever as soon as you sit in the car;

i, for one, am sick an tired of having people trying to selling me things at all times, and i don't want myself or my children to live in a world where they have to start their work day as soon as they get in the freaking car, because people should work to live, not live to work!

not to mention that not only is the technology ""not there yet"", it won't be anytime soon when it comes to any practical significant application and any claims on the contrary are simply marketing, because humans drive by a mix of rules and subjective ""gut"" decisions made in a split second, therefore any ai has to be able to take that into account in order to be able to coexist in the same road as people... and that requires animal-level ai, and we're nowhere close to that: we don't understand how the interplay between the myriad of systems that comprise a brain work together to create intelligence and consciousness, and yet people talk about the subject as if we've got it all figured out and codified in the form of a neat little algorithm!

the solution to this lack of general intelligence of our ai systems would be, of course, to ban people of the road entirely... which is much more likely... but not only would that be absolutely tyrannical, it would also be pretty stupid because that would just be a roundabout way of creating dedicated infrastructure for self-driving cars, and once you have dedicated infrastructure what you end up with is essentially a glorified, overpriced, and less energy efficient train, specially when you factor in r&d costs... which are being spent by big tech, sure, but still they could have been better spent feeding and clothing of people in need!

on a personal note, if you work in the tech field criticism of concept of self-driving cars is often equated with being an anti-vaxxer or a climate skeptic: the tech industry has managed to create such a self-serving hype around self-driving cars, that we're no longer able to have a calm, quiet, rational discussion about this subject without being branded ""reactionary"", foolish, and sometimes even egotistical and evil by self-driving car advocates. 

and this is no way to discuss a subject, or even do science for that matter: that's how you end up burning people at the stake for daring to think the earth revolves around the sun.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9819}",positive

(1) this instance of workforce redundancy and phaseout would be a massive hit to the world economy. this cannot be compared to the elevator operators, typesetters, or wordprocessors. according to the bureau of transportation statistics (bts), drivers make up 9.1% of the us workforce. many of these jobs do not require a degree. where are all these ""unskilled"" workers going to go? even if you don't care about them, their job loss would greatly impact the us economy. (i don't have world statistics, but i would guess other developed countries would experience similar problems)
(2) the issue of liability doesn't seem to be worked out. if there is no human error, whose responsibility is it  when  two computer-driven cars crash? is it the manufacturer or the programmer? maybe there was a software update that didn't ""automatically"" download and install.
(3) pay-for-play-driver mode. it is bad enough that a car can cost as must as twice the original price after you add on ""extras."" at least that's your car. i am not interested in virtual dlc, where if i don't update the software on my car because it takes too long, or because i live in a remote area,  i now have no transportation.
(4) security: a well-informed or determined thief will always have the ability to steal a car. but at least the thief generally has to be physically present.  i am not interested in having my car stolen from some eastern european 3rd rate hacker.  also, imagine a 9/11 hijacking of 1,000 automated cars because a company got its information stolen.
(5) those cars are ugly. i enjoy driving my mitsubishi evolution x mr. i'm not interested in an auto-driven corvette. it would take all the fun out of driving the car....i.e. you would not be driving the car. then, only absolute idiots would buy exotic sports cars. 

in summary, the technology for it may be there, but just like lightbulbs that can last for hundreds of years, businesses are in the business of screwing over their customers. the current computer market should prove a warning before we turn our cars into ""smartcars.""

lasers don't work in heavy rain did they explain what they do i assume they stop before it hits most of the time the rest you crash. planes use rain penetrating radar.

you have certainly helped kill a large number of people today. why they never mention how they prevent hacking and you don't either. yet that is a certain thing it even been shown that current cars can be hacked and nasty things done but they can't take over and aim the car yet. in the future they will aim the car. 

elevators can't be hacked at least at this point i hope. and if hacked all they can do is freeze them in place or run them up and down.

if you have 1 autonomous car tracking 10 manned cars, it can relay that data to another autonomous car that's joining up to that road via intersection. so the second car will already know where those 10 cars are before it can even see them.
if 30% of cars are autonomous, then every autonomous car will know the location of every manned car in the whole area so long as that manned car can be seen by other autonomous cars.
there could also be sensors mounted at intersections, especially more dangerous or busier intersections so the autonomous cars will have a birds eye view of the entire intersection.

also there could be basic reflectors that are better suited to autonomous cars on the sides of roads. elon musk is wrong when he said there's no future in lidar. i would not want a camera only autonomous car. sun glare affects cameras just as much as it does human eyes.

   its like how if you want an app on your phone that performs a specific task, you may have to let them read all your text messages and scan your pictures.  if it's a music player, there is likely one that doesn't collect your data, but for many things there may not be an app that does what you want with out the invasion.  this problem didn't have to evolve like that, but people weren't paying attention and the market developed in such a way that cleaning it out of this behavior is no longer possible.
  i remember growing up shows like eureka (among others) where there was a smart house that listened all that time and attach to the internet if it was required to get an answer.  the house computer was primarily yours and looked out for your best interest.  the a.i. was local and under your control.  but that's not what we got.  what we got is a system where you own the hardware but a company, who is looking out for their interest (not yours) actually controls the a.i.  its a subtle difference but it does matter.  the companies will do what they think they can get away with if it doesn't effect their bottom line.  the a.i. you own will protect your information unless it is necessary for something you have initiated.
  i was talking with my kids (25ish) last night and i described a situation where it was clear that some app had scanned pictures i sent to a friend.  i had sent a friend a pic of an obscure object but never named the object in text form, nor had i talked with him on the phone, nor had he looked up it or any related item.  my friend got an add for the same item the next day.  i was hesitant when telling my kids, thinking, they might think i was sounding conspiracy theorist.  i was shocked to find they all were like yeah of course they do that.  i told them ""wow five years ago you might have all thought i was crazy if i said that"".
  bringing it back.... cars can go the same way.  there is a quote ""those who would trade their liberty for security deserve and shall have neither"".  with out getting into the fact that's a misquote of a quote out of context... the idea contained in that line still rings true if you think about it.  if you, with out really understanding, give away your autonomy/liberty/what ever... to someone who doesn't have your best interest in mind... sometimes you can't get it back, or getting it back is so costly that you just continue on without that part of yourself.  giving that power to a government is questionable but necessary, with limits.  but giving it to a company is just questionable.  but given time and enough people not questioning it, but still doing it, can make it necessary for those in the future.  meaning we can give control of our future to companies.  this is why some depictions of the future in moves are of a world controlled by corporate interest.  its why some people are scared of self driving cars even if they haven't thought it all out.  they see their control leaving them and its scary.  if we as a people treated it like they aren't wrong.... they just aren't right yet, then we have a chance at avoiding the negative side of new tech.  most new techs have a down side with their up, think nuclear bomb, nuclear power.  tech is just a tool and as humans we use them.  its why good government is elected.... so we (try to) put good people in office who will reflect our views and can be replaced if they don't, who is electing the people running companies?  oh man, i just thought of an example that would happen right now if self driving cars were the standard.  in ch-eye-nah right now, if you are considered an ""undesirable"" by the state you can't take planes and trains, think of the no fly list but applied more liberally and to some local transit.  if they fully convert to autonomous vehicles, if you can't afford a car/parking/insurance, better hope you like biking and walking and don't need to travel to another city.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9954}",positive

modern ai is arguably not learning anything, just memorizing an immense library of patterns. we do not have any feasibly ability to audit the source code of the self-driving vehicles because there essentially isn't any, just an impossible to untangle mess of various learned models taped together, with a bunch of layers. anyone who worked in software knows how things can get really ugly really fast in the real world, even when humans know what the software is meant to do and how it's designed, and from what little has transpired out of companies like tesla, we know their software efforts do not exist on some ethereal plane of existence where the typical problems don't apply.

those vehicles are trained in often unrealistic scenarios: only on simple, wide, straight american (st)roads, or only in clear weather conditions, or with training data with ""exceptional"" events culled away for easier training. you make the analogy to elevators and airplanes, but really that's silly, because those are effectively on rails, much like trains. cars are _not_ trains and roads at _not_ rails. the possibility space is much smaller, and there is no complex reading of human behavior required to insert in elevator or air corridor traffic. on a road, you come into much closer contact, at much faster speeds, with other agents, who are very hard to predict and to read, even for humans sometimes. simply playing it safe and avoiding the hard situations will not work in the real world, and neither will deferring to a driver who was told they could relax. asking for an overnight transition is even less.

context is impossible for self-driving cars to understand: a suicidal person walking towards the road with bad intentions, kids playing on the side, people having a bbq, or whatever context where people are in line of sight for the car, are impossible to distinguish for an ai, it will just see people near the road. because of that, the car will be tuned to react overly confident, or underconfident, or likely both. how does a driverless car react to other dangerous drivers attempting road-rage manoeuver ? yes it won't get ""angry"", but it can still very likely get outside of comfortable operation conditions and be put in a situation it wasn't trained on. what about learner drivers ? intoxicated drivers ? someone having a stroke ? a mechanical failure ?

a human does need training to react to every possible scenario, because it has a _brain_ and understands what it is doing. what humans are trash at is boring driving conditions and boring everyday commutes where people are effectively driving in autopilot mode themselves, not fully aware of the situation. this is where driving aids come into their own, and can augment the driver awareness. this is desirable. what i'm less sure about is leaving that sweet spot for systems that involve the human so little it completely loses any involvement, because then the human insight into context is lost to the vehicle.

the next part is this tech is exploitable. adversarial attacks on those networks are not a new thing, and that's before you get in the actual infosec security issues of having fully drive-by-wire cars with network connectivity to the drivetrain. you'd be hard pressed to find _any_ security researcher who's honestly _not_ nervous about safety-critical closed-source systems connected to the internet, let alone who would trust one with his own life.

lastly i don't like what this means in a world were all cars are autonomous. this tech isn't free, it is owned by some of the biggest conglomerates who already have a dangerous level of control over our lives. in a future where only autonomous cars are allowed, and where we no longer own our cars, we are now tributary of the whims of that corporation for getting around. losing your google account is bad enough today, but tomorrow it could mean you can get stranded. or it could mean a cartel could own the pricing for transportation and artificially raise it for profit maximization. we've seen how that does wonders already in plenty of areas in tech. forfeiting the privilege of driving to machines means losing it to a couple dozen companies, who will exert total control on who is allowed on the roads, which were supposed to be public infrastructure.

is human freedom worth loss of life ? now you have some real questions to discuss, and historically the answer has been a big fat ""it's complicated"".",32,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': -0.8189}",negative

when they speak about reducing congestion i imagine they are talking about how an extremely large amount of congestion is caused by human drivers.
imagine a long line of human drivers taking off from a stop, they ""caterpillar"" along and do not accelerate at the same rate.
compared to a long line of autonomous vehicles which can all accelerate at the same rate without risk of collision.

then you can begin to think about how this can be a solo ride or a ride share, which could further reduce congestion if people are willing to share a ride that would mean anywhere from 1 to 5 (regular sedan) less vehicles on the road.

as for the infrastructure... roads exist. the cost of developing software and building these vehicles would pale in comparison to any conceivable large scale mass transit rail system.
this makes this technology accessible to people, not just corporations or governments who are happy with the status quo because it makes them wealthy.

as for parking... i imagine that you can book your vehicle for a certain time of day or call one up within minutes which will then take you wherever you're going and if you have these vehicles with significantly more uptime than a personal vehicle (they mentioned 95% downtime in the video for personally owned vehicles on average) then there doesn't need to be as many vehicles on the road to service the same population of people.
you would obviously have peak transit times and if those vehicles aren't in use they need to be on standby somewhere...
but the ideal situation they talk about i think refers to the roads and vehicles being predominantly autonomous which could mean a drastic reduction in the requirements for parking spaces.

there are other important things to be uncomfortable with about those cars. first, at what price will they be sold ? i mean, better safety only for the wealthier people around is a new source of inequality we really don't need... if you don't wanna drive, just take a bus (how about a driverless bus, huh ?). 
then, are we sure they will reduce traffic ? the occupancy rate of today's cars is already quite low (below 1.5 people in a car on average), but if driverless cars arrive on the market it may even drop below 1 ! just imagine, people having the possibility to send their car anywhere on a whim because they didn't plan ahead for its use, like ""oh i took the car this morning for whatever reason but now my partner needs it to get back from work, let's just send it to them with no one inside since it doesn' t need anyone to ride it !"". and we'd end up with a bunch on unused car on the roads, what a mess.
finally there is the environmental impacts of these. all the technology and the electronic devices that those cars need to work are costly in resources, can we afford to put them everywhere ? moreover there is the pollution produced by the driving itself. i mean, we actually need to remove cars from traffic if we are to halt climate change and stuff.
plus as you mentioned this technology cannot be deployed in the whole world because of the infrastructures needed and the maintenance cost they imply, which is another cause of imbalance between developed countries and the others (which we exploit a lot to get the resources the cars are made of btw).

really there are many ethical and political matters that need to be prioritized apart from knowing whether the car should hit the baby or the nun or whatever. and i don't mean to be a killjoy here, all those matters could make for excellent subjects for videos i think - but we have to think about it before we take any step in commercializing driverless cars",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.8546}",positive

so to counter the asiana airlines incident, there is also turkish airlines flight 1951 where an autonomous computer decision based on broken radio altimeter crashed the airplane. 

the equivalent for roads would be rebuilding roads entirely, equipping cars with more proactive hardware  and implementing very strict license requirements. effectively making driving a hard to obtain privilege. this is how it's done in western europe. obtaining a license is really hard and expensive. there are strict yearly checks for cars on the street. the violations are subject to an escalating system and your license will be taken away permanently if you cause too many violations. this is why the usa has the vehicle related fatality rate ~11 / 100k while germany has ~3 / 100k population.

the cheapest and safest solution to the human transportation on land is having good public transportation which can be automated pretty easily and will push human fatalities quite a bit down.

lidar only works in good weather conditions (e.g. heavy fog or water spray from cars in front is deadly), same for cameras. and those ranges of 300m for lidar and 500m for camera sound absolutely unbelievable! like, pick any sign on a local road, walk 500m away, take a picture and then try to read the sign in the image. you won't. typical ranges one talks about when using cameras in autonomous driving are like 100-150m max.

also, you see at least 4 lidar-sensors mounted on the car in the video. has anyone thought about the cost? the 360¬∞ one on top is at least 30,000$, the others probably like half of that each. on top of that you have the 28(!) cameras (some of them with expensive lenses, if they are supposed to come even close to what is claimed) and several radar sensors. the latter typically cost about 1,500$ each. in sum this means that just the sensor equipment costs more than most normal cars! how is this supposed to go into a mass-produced consumer product?

last point i want to make: energy consumption. with electric cars we are already talking about their comparably low driving range. all of these sensors and especially the gpus/tpus and processors needed to make use of the data need a lot, and i really mean *a lot*,  of power. this doesn't go well together at all.
(before anyone mentions tesla: they have never used close to this many sensors or had such a high level of automation. and there is a reason why they recently announced that they will exclusively rely on cameras in the future.)

for example, 1 million miles driven by a computer is not comparable to 1 million miles driven by a human. both learn differently, and thus the ""experience"" gained is not comparable. derek never really said they are directly comparable, but the implication was strong, and i don't really agree with that.

the plane example is popular, but also a misrepresentation. think about this: why did we have automatic flight systems for a few decades before there was fully autonomous driving?
flying a plane is hard for humans for different reasons than it is for computers. for average untrained humans, there are too many sensors and actors (known inputs) to pay attention to. also, humans are not very good at replicating a certain action perfectly every time. computers can handle a great number of known inputs quite well. what makes flying easier for computers than driving on public roads are the unknown inputs: situation and circumstance. the airspace is mostly empty. there are fewer situations with external factors, where a computer would have a hard time to give a proper reaction. and landing in foggy weather is not harder for a computer to do, because the chosen inputs for the control system can deal with that. which is good, but you can't use that to argue, that computers by definition handle situations better than humans. 
cars are the other way around: much fewer known inputs (good for humans), but a large number of unknown inputs due to dense traffic. humans can deal with that much better than computers. 
please don't use automatic flight systems to argue computers can handle autonomous driving better than humans. 

the video shows a lot of empty roads with low density traffic. if that is the situation, then human error is also less likely to cause an accident. and distraction and intoxication are good reasons for public transport for example. 
what i would have liked to see is not a total number of human error accidents vs computer error accidents, but rather to distinguish the traffic situation. 

now, do i believe autonomous driving can work? yes of course, it is demonstrated in the video. for the kind of traffic shown in very confident autonomous driving will be better than average human drivers, at some point even better than very good drivers.
but what i don't see is s mostly autonomous driving traffic all around the world. in my opinion, this will remain more of a novelty in rich, developed areas with well-managed traffic. 
what i would rather see is assisted driving. since there are actual problems human drivers have (such as a very limited viewing area), certain assistants will make human-controlled driving much more safe. 
autonomous driving is not a good solution for large-scale mobility of a society. we essentially can't just replace all of our cars with autonomous vehicles, because that is not sustainable. we are very much used to individual mobility, where essentially every adult has their own car and can drive when and where they want. climate change and pollution show, that this can not sustain. 
we need a new mobility, and public transport needs to be much more included again. autonomous taxis might be a small part in it, limited to well-developed areas. 
in the end, autonomous driving is a bit like the last straw for the car industry to promote a long-term future for their product. but at this point we should be aware, that individual mobility how we are doing it now is not sustainable, if we think 50 years ahead, or even less. 

conclusion: the video was fun, and as an engineer i'm excited about the cool technological solutions shown. and i would ride an autonomous car if i get the chance. but i'm my option, some of the key arguments in this video are misleading, and that is a bit disappointing. even for a sponsored video.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9942}",positive

- the number of hours of data a system is trained on is not a good measure of how safe the system is. with ai it just tells how ingrained patterns have become and how resistant to changes it now is. overtraining an ai system is a thing as well, where it will find patterns where there are none and behave erratically. it gives mild confidence that it has seen some edge cases, but the statistic alone gives no confidence that it can handle situations a human *could* handle if they encounter it. an actual list of situations it should pass, and looking through that data if it actually encountered it would be much more useful.
- the statistics about the number of incidents do say something about safety, but only in the environment it has driven. which, right now, seems to be two places: suburbs outside of phoenix, arizona, and in san francisco and mountain view, california.
- the point at the beginning of the video that a lot of people think self-driving cars are >10 years away, and that this is not the case because you are riding in one is poorly substantiated. the system is trained on san francisco, and probably works fine in san francisco, but that doesn't mean it will translate well to another city in the us, the countryside or another country entirely. this has nothing to do with ""badly maintained roads"", and more with different scenarios the system has never encountered before. the ability to identify parked cars on the road. the ability to identify when it *should* go with two wheels off-road (which you say it doesn't), because the road is too small for two vehicles to pass. the ability to identify when it cannot go with two wheels off-road and should stop at a part of the road that is a bit wider, designed to let two vehicles pass on a road that is usually too narrow for that. the ability to identify bike roads, where cars are allowed but cyclists can use the entire width of the road. situations where road rules tell the car that it has right of way, but where human drivers commonly stop to let traffic pass for one reason or another.
- when looking at safety, replacing a random normal car with an autonomous car is not as simple as looking at ""is this car safer than the average driver"". you also have to look at scalability of the system, and what happens if you have, for example, a 100 of these cars on the same road. right now, i would assume that these cars actively blind each other with their lidar. i would assume they can handle some data corruption due to that, but it makes the cars less reliable.
- the animation of an intersection where cars just communicate with each other instead of waiting for traffic lights is still a long way away. such an intersection requires absolute trust between vehicles, because every vehicle on that intersection must know and trust every other vehicle on that intersection to have a plan, and execute that plan exactly as advertised. that would require 100% autonomous cars, and the only way you could trust a car 100% is if they run your software and you know its internal reasoning, or if there is some protocol in place that can handle cases like cars just not communicating. this car is not capable of doing that, and is unlikely to be able to do that in the near future.
- moral dilemmas do not cease to be moral dilemmas if your average driver is incapable of making the decision in the first place. waymo's vehicles predict several future scenarios. it will try it's best to get to a destination, and try it's best to avoid collisions while doing so. but it will make decisions based on the data it receives, and those decisions are made by those who tweak the vehicle time after time. and most (moral) dilemmas are not as uncommon as the ones you showcased. for example: should the car break if a ball-like object bounces on the street, and the car is not predicted to hit it? if a trash can falls over on the street, and it predicts it cannot break to avoid hitting it, should it swerve around it? if a car hits a barrier and bounces into traffic in front of an autonomous car, should it break or swerve? what about if there is a heavy truck behind the car? what about if swerving has the potential for no other collisions to occur? what if that chance is 1%? these decisions have already been made by the people working on waymo, either by tackling such edge cases or letting the ai network decide on it's own. you have a point that waiting for those moral dilemmas to all be solved before using autonomous vehicles is not going anywhere (we have infinite many of them), but i think you make light of these moral dilemmas. these are moral dilemmas that need to be solved, because it shouldn't be up to the programmers of the vehicle to make that call, or to come up with edge cases to test for.

that said, you make some good points. people are notoriously bad at driving and drive-assist or fully autonomous vehicles can help with that. a large quantity of autonomous vehicles can reduce congestion on highways, because they just automatically drive the same speed as each other and do not swerve left and right all the time. autonomous vehicles are great for people that cannot or do not want to drive a car, and have to get around in places where there is no or inadequate public transport. i just wished you would have looked in a more critical way at this.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9946}",positive

as you say, lidar only works in good weather conditions (e.g. heavy fog or water spray from cars in front is deadly), same for cameras. and those ranges of 300m for lidar and 500m for camera sound absolutely unbelievable! like, pick any sign on a local road, walk 500m away, take a picture and then try to read the sign in the image. you won't. typical ranges one talks about when using cameras in autonomous driving are like 100-150m max.

also, you see at least 4 lidar-sensors mounted on the car in the video. has anyone thought about the cost? the 360¬∞ one on top is at least 30,000$, the others probably like half of that each. on top of that you have the 28(!) cameras (some of them with expensive lenses, if they are supposed to come even close to what is claimed) and several radar sensors. the latter typically cost about 1,500$ each. in sum this means that just the sensor equipment costs more than most normal cars! how is this supposed to go into a mass-produced consumer product?

last point i want to make: energy consumption. with electric cars we are already talking about their comparably low driving range. all of these sensors and especially the gpus/tpus and processors needed to make use of the data need a lot, and i really mean *a lot*,  of power. this doesn't go well together at all.
(before anyone mentions tesla: they have never used close to this many sensors or had such a high level of automation. and there is a reason why they recently announced that they will exclusively rely on cameras in the future.)",0,UgxFBLjd2p7Te0lPzEN4AaABAg,True,none,"{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9601}",positive

secondly, while i strongly believe that driverless cars are better than average humans at certain tasks, i also strongly believe that they're *worse* than humans at other tasks. i very, very strongly doubt that the venn diagram of driverless vs driver skills completely contains all driver skills perfectly. we've had over a century of time to revise and tweak the human driving experience to account for a lot of human shortfalls, but porting those tweaks over to an entirely new driver system is going to present us with a lot of unpredictable situations. 

also, i just don't trust computer vision yet. it's made some huge strides over the past decade, but it's noisy output and inability to reason are just one of those things that can fail catastrophically when you least expect it. like, a human would know if they saw a car teleporting all over the road they should probably either steer well clear of the entire situation or pull over and get some rest. but for a lot of computer vision that's just a fact of life, smoothed out in software to facilitate a more comfortable passenger experience.

and finally, the big one: this is going to take a long, long, long long time to legislate. even if they are perfectly reliable, even if they are perfectly tested, we have over a century of (critical!) rules and regulations that would need to be amended, overturned and revised. in america you'll likely see them sooner, since the rights of big business seem to always be preferred to public safety, but in europe and a lot of the rest of the world, it's going to be a substantially more lengthy process to ensure the safety of the public is ensured. not that americans would likely get completely off the hook; you also have a huge number of people who are violently afraid of change, and i fully expect to hear about roving gangs of anti-autonomy brigades deliberately running autonomous vehicles off the road in the name of freedom.

as i said, i fully believe that this will be coming in future, although i suspect a lot of it will only happen after some countries do a significant autonomy-friendly infrastructure pass with wireless communication beacons and computer-vision-friendly signage and the like.

1. in an elevator, there are zero external factors to control for. in an airplane, it's just the environment which the computer needs to compute for, that too on an almost completely predictable, standardised runway with the best, most expensive safety measures. these do not even compare to driving on the road - especially when there are such crazy drivers on it. i live in india, and the traffic in a large city such as bangalore is often much, much more sane than traffic in a small city such as mysore, where people will drive in completely crazy ways, with no regard for any rules. they'll drive full speed on the wrong side, or come into the main road at 90¬∞ at full speed in a two wheeler with three helmetless riders on it. the lights will switch from green to red with no warning, etc. can computers really intuit how crazy humans will behave? humans often can.
2. following up on the last statement, 20 million miles as a rock in a driverless car is worth nothing, because rocks cannot think. of course, the algorithms these cars use are sophisticated, but can we really compare the miles of experience of a computer vs the miles of experience of a human? humans learn a lot of things very fast and intuitively, especially how other humans will behave. we've had billions of years of evolution training us for  this. computers with all their decades of training cannot even speak like a normal human being, something a four year old easily can. computers still kinda suck at object recognition, but a kitten a few months old has no problem.
3. and my weakest point here: sure, these cars might reduce the human error accidents that we know about, but will they introduce new errors that we don't know about? i think that's the fear everyone who's anxious about these vehicles has. both the 8% of ""terrified"" people, and the ~40% of ""10+ years away"" people.

that said, here's what i think stands in favour of the computers:

a. they can share knowledge, so every extra computer adds more knowledge quickly.

b. they can simulate different situations (but so can we; we also imagine different scenarios. especially when we have an almost-accident, we imagine how bad it would have been if the accident actually occurred.)

c. suppose a car from a thousand years in the future arrives here today. and in this future, autonomous car accidents are unheard of. my anxiety with the car would still exist - it would have to drive for a while before i feel safe. i think that the people getting worried about the edge cases of whom to kill are really manifesting a slightly different and much more understandable anxiety. our anxieties are dependent on our experience in the car. our judgement of how well the car is driving is based on what kind of mistakes a bad human driver will make, not the kind of mistakes a bad ai might make - we just don't have the right tools to judge an ai. an ai might feel like a safe human driver for 10 hours and then just run right over a wayward pedestrian - that psychopathic possibility is something we cannot judge as humans. hence the fear. the only cure is experience and statistics - total miles driven without incident, and it's nice to see that at least in the (i'm assuming) well-behaved us, these particular cars are doing well.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.9938}",negative

derek(?) used a comparison of automatic elevators as a reference to the emerging technology of fully autonomous vehicles.  however this reminds me of something even older still.  in the very earliest days of railways there were no trackside signals; only employees/police giving hand signals.  the 25/08/1861 clayton tunnel rail crash occurred in one of the earliest rail blocks to have signals, and despite the root cause being human error some people living at the time drew the conclusion that railway signals would actually increase accidents instead of reducing them.  today we know that not to be the case.  hopefully in a generation we'll have more acceptance of fully autonomous vehicles.

the only concern i have about this emerging technology is what it will do to the job market and economy.  what will happen to people whose livelihood relies on driving?  will all transport vehicles, including container trucks be driverless in the future?",1,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.7996}",negative

while yes, it would instantly save lives, and i'm all for a future where i don't own a car, they simply can't handle all situations, and just because more people will live, doesn't mean a specific individual will be safer.

the sensors and programming just haven't had enough real world testing.  from glitches to bugs in code to sensor failure to computerized attack, there are too many variables, and not yet enough data to get it right.  these vehicles still struggle to drive in the snow and rain.

it will be a long hard road to perfecting this.  much like your example of the pilot that took over and crashed the plane.  why haven't we gotten rid of pilots yet then?  ultimately the problem is control.  we feel like an elevator is perfect and safe, but it took decades after the technology was perfected.  we are looking at a similar timeline.  who do you prosecute when a driverless car runs someone over?  where is the blame, the lawsuits?  people like accountability, and yes, since most people believe they are above-average drivers, they will expect they are safer driving themselves.  after all, most people never experience a serious accident, and often prevent accidents with their driving ... of course they think highly of their abilities.  

an elevator and a plane are much simpler, and most of that boils down to obstacles, neither has to avoid hitting people in operation.  sensors will get better, coding will become more robust, redundancy is the name of the game, and the only way to ensure we feel safe in and around them.

it isn't just about lives.  i put forth you could save more lives by letting a computer feed you instead of choosing your own meals.  people are just not wired to play life that safe or passively.

we will get there, i feel there are many circumstances i would already use a self-driving car now.  but we have a long way to make it work perfectly enough.  ultimately it may just take a huge quick shift.  if every car on the road is self-driving and communicating with each other, no crashes with other vehicles would happen - ever.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.184, 'compound': 0.9934}",positive

because you tried to write off criticism of self driving as being limited to absurd trolley problems, while completely glossing over the facts that;
1. we already live in a world where ai/ml is under-regulated to the point that 'black box' algorithms are making healthcare and financial decisions that kill people, while those responsible simply shrug their shoulders and say they don't understand how the software works, and
2. uber's competing self-driving vehicles have already killed a pedestrian, and the only real action taken (other than uber making sure the press knew that the person was homeless and crossing the street improperly - as if the punishment for jaywalking should be death, and the lives of the poor and vulnerable should be valued less) was a software patch, and an assurance from a company, that already killed a pedestrian with a vehicle they claimed was safe enough to be trusted in their community, that it wouldn't happen again.

i'd like to pose you the question: would you volunteer to take responsibility if your self driving car killed someone in the process of making this video? if not, who would you shirk that responsibility to?

nevermind decisions about whether we should kill motorcyclists with or without helmets, or weighing the value of life of two old people against one young person. until we're mature enough to create a system of actual accountability for the decisions of an algorithm in the first place, these companies have no place setting the tone for the future of transport in our communities, and the message of your video is tremendously irresponsible.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.152, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.9783}",negative

when horses stopped being used as a method of transportation there was a change towards horses being used as part of a recreational pursuit for those in society who still see the appeal of horses.  not that i personally see the appeal of riding a horse, i do understand why others would see this appeal and i am therefore ok with society making provisions so that those who want to ride horses can do so.  will society in the future still be supportive of the people who still want to enjoy talking their vehicle out for a drive?  would it be practical to preserve certain scenic roads for the pursuit of going for a non-autonomous drive?  

it seems to me that having an interest in horse riding is something that is the reserve of the wealthier more privileged people in society as it is quite an expensive hobby/sport/interest.  will access to being able to enjoy driving non-autonomous vehicle also become something that will become the reserve of the wealthy?",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.9798}",positive

even worse: there will always be evil out there;

the firmware for these cars, will become a major target for spying, control, extortion, terrorism, etc.
just look at the cyberwar going on right now, the latest solarwinds and revil attacks is a good example.

the only reason people aren't scared, is because they either don't know, or don't understand the magnitude of the problem.

‚Äì the arguments about autonomous elevators and planes imply that this is a valid direct comparison. however, they aren't really comparable to driverless cars. ignore that the plane finds the runway using infrastructure at the airport, the localizer system, and it still should become clear that, even though there are other planes in the sky, what the autopilot of planes and elevators do is essentially operating without traffic. for a driverless car to meet this requirement, all it has to do is be able to follow roads and turn into driveways or parking lots _(which it may actually not even be able to do in all cases because it may rely on road markings, but depending on where it's used, this is irrelevant)._ it should be clear that this is not the concern most people have about self-driving cars.

‚Äì the argument about driver experience comes with a similar flaw: yes, the system has much more data than any human could ever collect themselves on the road, but humans learn magnitudes faster than machines. machines need exponentially more data to match what a human can achieve with a given amount of experience. of course, the difference in data here is huge, so there is likely still a valid argument in there, but it's presented to be much more extreme than it actually is.

‚Äì that an autonomous car drives confidently and passes your mental checks doesn't mean it would actually do well in an extreme situation. while with a human, you are likely to see somewhat easily how good of a driver they are overall, it's impossible to predict for sure if at some point a gap in the autonomous driving system may become apparent. a situation that never came up in the training data and that the car maybe chooses to handle badly. this doesn't discredit the safety of driverless cars overall, because these situations are unlikely _(this kind of plays into your argument about ethics discussions),_ but it should be noted that, especially with autonomous ""black box"" systems, there can be a big difference between feeling safe and being safe. human drivers can cause this effect, too _(especially in their own judgement of themselves, but as you are a passenger in the autonomous vehicle, we should also evaluate humans as passengers),_ but it's far less likely that an otherwise very good driver will have an incredibly specific weakness. again, this doesn't make autonomous cars unsafe, but the fact that you can sit in the back and be comfortable doesn't validate that.

‚Äì the advantages of autonomous driving presented at 16:41 are all achievable at higher safety than any car-based system by expanding public transport. this would also be more ecological. of course, there is the advantage to self-driving cars that they are more convenient as they take you from the start to the destination directly, without any walking or switching vehicles. but it is worth discussing whether this alone is enough to make driverless cars the preferable option. one might even argue that if we are going to give up some safety, compared to public transport, for the sake of convenience, we might as well give up even more of it for the convenience of owning our own cars...
but disregarding that, discussing the convenience, safety, comfort, capacity and environmental impacts of public transport and autonomous cars in comparison to one another makes a lot of sense and i personally feel should be a main point in this video. *it should certainly not be left out altogether.*",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.9933}",positive

i have had this discussion for at least 10 years and often talk it over with my father since he is an engineer but i have more of a philosophical tendency of thought.
well  that leads to him saying, as you do, that it is a positive and the future and i agree partly: but always ask:
what about the legal aspects in case of an incident/accident and what hypotheticals should be accounted for?
let me give some examples:
what if a deer jumps in front of the car: should the computer break or plow over the deer - based on factors such as traffic ofc - but how good is the computer at that determination?
and in the above replace a deer with a human child, can the computer tell the difference and how would that affect the algorithm? shall it value the life of the passengers(in the driving car or those behind aswell since they will rear end collide with the car breaking) above pedestrians and do a simple utilitarian calculation of what action kills/maims the least and is 10 maimed worth less or more than 1 dead?
in more socialistic oriented countries, such as denmark, where i live, the issue of insurance isn't such a hot topic (even though it always is since we aren't communists, naturally) but in america where you report from, it seems unrealistic to ever figure out how to insure self-driving cars and have any of your progressive polititians (in the technological sense of the word, not like you usually use it) considered any of this?
a driver has a choice and i believe that the human mind is more capable of that determination in the above scenarios.
the red cross organization has acknowledged that in crisis you give preferential treatment to your family and that was taught on my course for 1st aid by them and the danish legislature also has this clause when it comes to the rare cases of deciding if anyone failed to rescue someone (although that determination in and of itself is exceedingly hard to do as a jury) if you chose your family that is reasonable.
would you ever enter a car if you knew that it treated you and your family passengers less than any others on the road?

the argument you pose about autonomous vehicles not being prone to attention deficit while driving is true, but not distinct to the autonomy of the car, you could have legislature about alcohol-meters for engine start, alarms if you haven't had both hands on the wheel for the past 30sec ect ect(as the law proscribes that you drive with both hands on the steering wheel) but you are correct that an automated car does not have any of these issues, but the discussion is separated imo.

but just to round it off i do wish to see autonomous cars sooner than later and in a country where we communally pay the hospital bill and road cleanups, we have a duty to maximize the safety on the roads more so than in a country where all liability and risk historically always has been ones own.
that is also why i can't fathom that it isn't illegal to ride w/o a bicycle helmet here in denmark and if you choose to ride w/o you ought to pay a sizeable if not the full hospital bill yourself since you knowingly put yourself at greater risk and at greater cost to a society where you knew it is a heavier burden (economically) to the society - but that is entering a whole other sphere of discussion and with political tones that the yt trolls will shred to pieces and that isn't worth being trolled for.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9614}",positive

as a european i maybe drive once a month for longer trips or to transport something big, and when i do i actually enjoy the act of driving because we hardly get any traffic jams. the rest of the time it is actually much more convenient and faster to walk, bike or take public transport for my daily commutes.

i would urge americans to start fixing their infrastructure, public transport and don‚Äôt spend to much time and recourses in these kind of bandaids. most american cities are in incredible debt, because post war suburbs are basically a ponzy scheme. you can not tax your residents enough to maintain all those roads, high ways and parking spaces if everybody needs a car for everything they do. so they just keep on building and going into deeper dept.

there was so much nuance that was either brushed over or ignored, attributing poor performance to such throwaway comments as, ""in some parts of the world the roads aren't well enough maintained."" meanwhile you're driving round in perfect conditions on very wide american style roads, many of which are dual carriageways. try that waymo car on a narrow country road in the uk and see how it does, my bet is that it would cross the lane divider frequently just as tesla's do too. self driving cars that are trained on very wide american roads are actually dangerous and not fit for purpose on narrower uk and european roads. they also seem to be averse at making strong control inputs, which means that tight turns and corners are an issue for them, but again not a problem on wide roads with sweeping turns, and all intersections meet at 90 degrees.

i'm not a luddite, and i of course accept that in certain conditions and on certain types of road (essentially dual carriageways and motorways), they are undoubtedly better drivers and never suffer lapses in concentration. however i have not seen anything to suggest that any self driving tech has even come close to driving safely on smaller and more congested roads.

not to brag or anything, but i envisioned this exact scenario back in 2009 when i first read an article about google's first attempts at autonomus vehicle. back then i said that in 20 years or so, it might become illegal, at least in some places in the world, to manually drive a car. it was received as more than a bit excentric view back then. now i'm not sure, but look at how big of a leap was made during that 12 year period.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.7934}",negative

the push back from police departments as it will lessen revenue raising, the security risk (personal and national) of having widespread automation, political special interest groups aswell.

personally, even if statistically safer i do not wish to trust fully in the car industry which continually fails on grounds of safety.  
think about airbags, development started in the 1950s, modern design reached in the mid 60s yet over 100 million vehicles had to recalled over the explosive takata airbags.
or first seatbelt patent in 1885, yet gm had to recall 2020 models because they could light the car on fire or the recent ford recall for them not activating in a crash.

and alot of people just like driving. 

also on a more funny side, couple mates and i came up with milestones we wanna see;
first person to wake up miles in the the wrong direction because the car started going to null island
first person to fall out of car and have it continue to destination
first car to run out of gas without occupant.

how does the vehicle know where the lanes are, if you can't see them?  people a lot of times can't and just drive where they think they are.
how does the lidar, cameras and other sensors deal with getting snow/mud packed into/on them?
how does the vehicle handle getting stuck or avoiding deeps snow or drifting snow?
muggings/robberies of the future (play ambulance sound, and our victims are now stuck and can no longer drive away). ez.
and what about construction areas where jumping painted lanes to stay in you lane is the normal?
or when you have multiple lines (old ones painted over) but in the rain in the dark the glossiness looks the same?
what about other crazy construction areas?
or storms pushing trees down, will it attempt to go into oncoming traffic if safe to go around it?  or will you be forever stuck until a developer shows up? and what if electricity (like an electrical pole) is involved?
as for weighing consequences, your supposed to run over bambi instead of going into oncoming traffics,  do the cars do this?
these are just a couple random thoughts i had while watching the video.

what about the scenario where a tire blows out, or a component fails  like a ball joint or even worse, engine/lithium batteries catches on fire? i guess better hope the emergency stop sticks around and people are smart enough to use it if needed.  kids will need to be trained on this. penalties for using emergency stop on big highway bridges when not needed.
so, yes, while i can see where the average autonomous cars is probably better then the average humans when the environment is in good conditions compared to humans being human.  i wonder how that really changes when the car is put outside its element?

i do feel more comfortable with autonomous operations where systems are more regulated in freedom of movement, and surrounding information.  ie: monorail is on a rail and can only go forward and back and the logic behind the rail is simpler to recognize something on it.  an elevator goes up and down with backup brakes.  both previous examples with sensors on doors which work for most scenarios,  you can find videos of dogs + elevators + leashes (autonomous overlooking the system) that are cringe to watch as well as recently that school girl that was stuck in the bus door as it was driving (human overlooking system).  as for planes, they have adsb in/out, radar, active ground monitoring, rules of what can be done in what airspace etc... which make autonomous much more successful with the only downside is making sure the whole industry is on the same page.  autonomous cars have a lot of surrounding environmental variables that make it leary.  im sure with time it can reasonably account for these, and that probably explains why people say 10yrs.  that and a lot of scenarios never get explained.  i would really like to see a video showing ""what happens when"" with autonomous vehicles in the scenarios i came up with and more.",1,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9726}",positive

for me, the fact that the solution to urban traffic being talked about is self-driving cars and not public transportation infrastructure is indicative of a larger cultural issue in attachment to cars. the latter would be more equitable and far more environmentally friendly, but since our cities themselves are not designed for walkability but instead drivability, we're stuck with self-driving cars being seen as necessary to solve what should be a non-existent problem. i also worry about the future if self-driving cars are the only cars on the road, and we're still stuck with our current urban layout, as walkability of places would become basically non-existent in places without dedicated infrastructure to allow pedestrians to walk around the absolute mess of intersections.

a more accessible and much cheaper system of busses or even trains would benefit lower income families more and reduce traffic, not to mention reducing the carbon footprint because of fewer cars being on the road. furthermore, a larger series of bus lines is much easier to track than an entire city of self driving cars.

you could argue that self driving cars are better because they can bring you directly to your destination, but this wouldn't be a problem if we made cities and towns easier to navigate and all services within a wide radius were accessible from a single bus stop.

imagine how much more roadspace we would have if we had a huge system of free, accessible, and even self driving bus services. we can even still have individual self driving car services provided for people with disabilities that are too far from any bus stops. it would be so much safer and more efficient and probably a lot cheaper to just take cars off of the road rather than replacing regular cars with self driving cars. just visualize the difference between the entire warehouse of self driving cars vs a parking lot of busses that takes up less space but can transport the same amount of people.

the biggest issue with this suggested approach, however, would be breakdowns and security breaches. if a bus breaks down, everyone on that bus is being delayed, whereas if a car breaks down, only that one person is being affected depending on the circumstance. if a security breach happens on a single bus, that could spell danger for a very large number of people, but arguably a security breach on a single car could be just as bad.

this is where my fear of the self-driving aspect comes into play, since it is always possible that there is some person ready to cause trouble from the comfort of their own home, instead of having to use force to take control over a bus. think about what's easier to track and easier to prevent, an experienced hacker that found a hole in the self driving system's security or a guy going in a bus and stealing it.

despite all this, i think it's some great technology and an impressive feat that i'm excited to see the future of. to me, it just seems to be a more expensive and complicated solution to a more systemic problem that can be solved by improving the systems of transportation that we currently have in place.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.9926}",positive

why do you assume driverless cars are safer than human controlled? there is definitely not enough data to make such a statement. i don't even say that it's not the case, but there is certainly no proof for this anywhere in waymo's publications (they even state that it is very hard to produce reliable statistics to back such a statement).
you say it is unethical to not replace all cars by autonomous vehicles because lives could be saved? according to the same logic it would be unethical to remove the driver from the autonomous vehicle, because you know what is even safer than a driverless vehicle? a driverless vehicle with a driver as 'backup system'. this is the only form in which autonomous driving should be allowed in my opinion.

i strongly suspect it'll be a long time until they're allowed on the road without a qualified driver behind the wheel. for the next 20 years or so there will probably be a lot of jobs created driver escorts / chauffeurs, people who hold a valid license and are paid just to ride up front in the car in case they have to take over for whatever reason, it'll be a great way for people to say get a free ride into the city as well as make a few bucks.

one development i really think is overdue is the ability for cars to communicate with one another (beyond blasting the horn) it would be useful both for human drivers to signal to each other and it would virtually eliminate pile ups, imagine if your car knew several seconds before you did that the car 10 ahead of you just slammed on its breaks. obviously the benefit of autonomous cars being able to tell each other what they're doing and negotiate is enormous. and how great would it be if when you drove into a car park it immediately told your car where an empty space was and how to get there, then reserved it for you?

there is a great book by scott meyer called run program, it's set in the near future and talks about how the different driverless cars have different ""personalities"" like bmws are more aggressive with over-taking and lane changes. i found that idea really interesting because it's not something i'd considered before, but of course he's right, even given the requirement to obey local traffic regulations, the different manufacturers will use different software with different algorithms, and if ai is used then even individual cars will learn different habits depending on where and what kind of driving they do most often. a car used to tearing down the autobahn will likely learn to behave quite differently to one that spends its life stuck in london traffic.",0,,True,none,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.9921}",positive

 electric is pretty self-explanatory, electric motors are just way more efficient than ice, you can produce carbon free electricity etc. the only problem was energy density, but as storage technology improves, so does the need to ice drop.

i am a big fan of automation and i get that a lot of people say ""i would miss driving"". that might be true, that you don't get people away from driving, but new generations won't be so attached to that task. the upsides are enorm, from spacial problems for parking and charging spots, to safety, inclusion of people with disability or simply a reliable, way for old people to have autonomy. it's coming no matter what.

i think the last part is also crucial, but might need more of a cultural change. here in germany, we have ~80 million people, with 40 million automobiles. these 40 million cars are only used for about 1 hour a day on average and when in use, they transport 1.5 people on average. that is seriously wasteful, but cars are a status symbol. as younger generation question traditional values and status symbol, i think car sharing becomes more and more popular. even if you don't want to sit with stranger in a car, not having your car stand around useless for >95% of the time is a game changer.

the car has lasted too long and this solution adds to a congested/unsustainable system we currently have. also it adds problems. you didn't answer how the helmet vs non helmet rider scenario would play out, you just dismissed it as unlikely. how are these situations addressed? or what if these don't just yield to emergency vehicles but also to vip vehicles whose owner bought a platinum pass? these are subject to new laws in a way a population would not respond to. imagine an emissions goal could be met by reducing fuel consumption, but my (any single persons) particular route is impossible or unreasonable under those conditions. the car is just going to comply, regardless. 

also, as stated in your video, these are not ready for a world where drivers are 50-50 autonomous or a person. also what happens when there is a lot of lidar from many of these vehicles? what about adversarial devices that purposely mess with these systems? people use radar detectors, what if they install a device that will cause an autonomous vehicle to let them pass or cut in? what about the psychology where drivers know the system will avoid an accident at all costs so they become more aggressive, leading to an increase of person to person accidents when they miscalculate whether a vehicle is autonomous?

there are so many questions and this is amazing tech. i just think moving people and things the way we do is terrible and adding this to the mix isn't going to result in the positive future we can imagine or characterize with statistics.
